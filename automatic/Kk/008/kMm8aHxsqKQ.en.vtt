let's get it started here so basically
the<00:00:26.150> main<00:00:27.680> idea<00:00:28.680> behind<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.490> fpv<00:00:30.210> backpack

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the main idea behind this fpv backpack

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.330 
the main idea behind this fpv backpack
is<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:33.329> make<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.079> compact<00:00:35.040> as

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is just to make it as compact as

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.690 
is just to make it as compact as
possible<00:00:35.510> easy<00:00:36.510> transportation<00:00:37.700> wherever

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
possible easy transportation wherever

here the next thing here you also try to
stay<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:35.680> antennas

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
stay out of the way is the antennas

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.490 
stay out of the way is the antennas
itself<00:02:37.130> here<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.810> crosshair

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
itself here this is the crosshair

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.600 
itself here this is the crosshair
antenna<00:02:39.950> packed<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.460> when<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.870> know

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
antenna packed in so when I you know

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.610 
antenna packed in so when I you know
found<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.700> location<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.420> want<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.720> fly<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.320> just

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
found a location I want to fly I just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.030 
found a location I want to fly I just
put<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.920> down<00:02:49.220> i<00:02:49.989> tuck<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.290> front<00:02:51.590> part<00:02:51.830> down

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
put it down i tuck the front part down

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.979 
put it down i tuck the front part down
this<00:02:52.310> part<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.760> exposed<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:55.010> crosshair

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
this part is exposed the crosshair

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.160 
this part is exposed the crosshair
points<00:02:56.989> whatever<00:02:57.290> direction<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:58.130> am<00:02:58.220> flying

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790 

there's<00:03:03.170> also<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.400> second<00:03:04.850> receiver<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:05.800> just

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
there's also the second receiver is just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.750 
there's also the second receiver is just
the<00:03:06.920> omni<00:03:07.510> directional<00:03:08.510> antenna<00:03:09.200> here<00:03:09.760> looks

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
the omni directional antenna here looks

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.680 
the omni directional antenna here looks
all<00:03:10.940> around<00:03:11.480> me<00:03:12.160> for<00:03:13.160> closer<00:03:13.459> distances<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.600> I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
all around me for closer distances if I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.190 
all around me for closer distances if I
fly<00:03:14.870> behind<00:03:15.080> myself<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:17.120> antenna<00:03:17.989> will

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
fly behind myself this antenna will

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080 
fly behind myself this antenna will
catch<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.580> like<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.850> said

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
catch it and this is like I said

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.570 
catch it and this is like I said
directional<00:03:21.580> racing<00:03:22.580> out<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:24.680> pretty<00:03:25.340> long

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
directional racing out and a pretty long

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.970 
directional racing out and a pretty long
distance<00:03:26.060> with<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.390> but<00:03:27.350> in<00:03:27.470> here<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:27.920> I

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
distance with this but in here like I

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.210 
distance with this but in here like I
said<00:03:28.190> before<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> entire<00:03:31.160> thing

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
said before this is the entire thing

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.120 
said before this is the entire thing
here<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.540> just<00:03:32.930> put<00:03:33.920> into<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:35.680> plastic<00:03:36.680> bin

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
here it's just put into a plastic bin

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.250 
here it's just put into a plastic bin
here<00:03:37.430> all<00:03:37.880> glued<00:03:38.540> together<00:03:40.600> pretty<00:03:41.600> rigid<00:03:41.900> as

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
here all glued together pretty rigid as

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.370 
here all glued together pretty rigid as
well<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.220> diversity

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
well and this here is the diversity

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.020 
well and this here is the diversity
eagle<00:03:48.670> tree<00:03:49.670> or<00:03:50.030> eagle<00:03:50.420> high<00:03:50.630> diversity<00:03:51.230> box

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
eagle tree or eagle high diversity box

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.340 
eagle tree or eagle high diversity box
basically<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.150> picks<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.750> best<00:03:53.900> signal

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
basically it just picks the best signal

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.680 
basically it just picks the best signal
between<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.040> crosshair<00:03:55.580> antenna<00:03:55.880> the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
between the crosshair antenna the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.510 
between the crosshair antenna the
directional<00:03:57.170> antenna

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
directional antenna

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.280 
directional antenna
for<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.540> omni<00:03:58.900> antenna<00:03:59.250> here<00:04:00.540> whichever<00:04:01.540> is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
for the omni antenna here whichever is

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.600 
for the omni antenna here whichever is
the<00:04:02.740> best<00:04:03.010> signal<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:04.030> picks<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.540> and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the best signal just picks that and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.910 
the best signal just picks that and
gives<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.910> best<00:04:07.060> reception<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.770> other

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
gives you the best reception the other

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.200 
gives you the best reception the other
thing<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.220> have<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.700> here<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:10.210> just<00:04:11.140> have<00:04:11.320> my

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
thing I have in here I just have my

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.789 
thing I have in here I just have my
goggles<00:04:15.060> comes<00:04:16.060> straight<00:04:16.510> out<00:04:16.540> I'm<00:04:17.470> sitting

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
goggles comes straight out I'm sitting

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.400 
goggles comes straight out I'm sitting
on<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.920> bench<00:04:18.190> wherever<00:04:18.760> put<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.299> on<00:04:19.410> flying

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
on a bench wherever put it on flying

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.850 
on a bench wherever put it on flying
from<00:04:20.590> here<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.580> like<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:21.760> said<00:04:21.850> before<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
from here and like I said before the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.180 
from here and like I said before the
transmitter<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.470> that's

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
transmitter I have to so that's

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.010 
transmitter I have to so that's
basically<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:28.150> mean<00:04:28.450> that's<00:04:28.810> all<00:04:28.990> you

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
operate the entire system off of a

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.980 
operate the entire system off of a
3-cell<00:05:04.600> battery<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:06.150> mean<00:05:07.150> some<00:05:07.390> more<00:05:07.540> details

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
3-cell battery I mean some more details

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.800 
3-cell battery I mean some more details
here<00:05:08.520> it's<00:05:09.520> pretty<00:05:09.670> simple<00:05:09.970> i<00:05:10.120> mean<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.780> know

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
here it's pretty simple i mean you know

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.930 
here it's pretty simple i mean you know
i<00:05:10.870> have<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.140> two<00:05:11.260> receivers<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:12.460> connected

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
i have the two receivers it's connected

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.510 
i have the two receivers it's connected
to<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.270> diversity<00:05:14.260> box<00:05:14.470> too<00:05:14.710> eagle<00:05:15.220> eyes

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
to the diversity box too eagle eyes

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.330 
to the diversity box too eagle eyes
diversity<00:05:16.240> box<00:05:16.480> and<00:05:17.020> then<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.770> just<00:05:17.830> have<00:05:18.100> a

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
diversity box and then I just have a

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.840 
diversity box and then I just have a
volt<00:05:19.030> meter<00:05:19.120> right<00:05:19.990> here<00:05:20.610> telling<00:05:21.610> me<00:05:21.730> how

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
volt meter right here telling me how

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.050 
volt meter right here telling me how
much<00:05:21.910> better<00:05:22.150> i<00:05:22.270> have<00:05:22.450> left<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:23.050> well<00:05:24.060> over

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
much better i have left so well over

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.760 
much better i have left so well over
draining<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.900> whole<00:05:26.020> thing<00:05:26.170> just<00:05:26.320> shuts<00:05:26.590> down

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
draining the whole thing just shuts down

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.740 
draining the whole thing just shuts down
and<00:05:27.040> i<00:05:27.130> go<00:05:27.550> blind<00:05:27.880> with<00:05:28.210> my<00:05:28.360> pv<00:05:28.750> system<00:05:30.750> all

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
and i go blind with my pv system all

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.860 
and i go blind with my pv system all
right<00:05:32.020> like<00:05:32.950> i<00:05:33.040> said<00:05:33.130> for<00:05:33.460> this<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.390> entire

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
right like i said for this is the entire

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.260 
right like i said for this is the entire
system<00:05:35.310> i'm<00:05:36.310> going<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.580> make<00:05:36.670> another<00:05:36.940> video

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
system i'm going to make another video

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.980 
system i'm going to make another video
about<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:39.280> tripod<00:05:40.000> set<00:05:40.330> up<00:05:40.480> so<00:05:41.290> this<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.710> the

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
about the tripod set up so this is the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.540 
about the tripod set up so this is the
you<00:05:43.990> know<00:05:44.080> compact<00:05:44.919> easy<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:47.340> maneuver<00:05:48.340> take

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
you know compact easy to maneuver take

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.090 
you know compact easy to maneuver take
it<00:05:48.700> anywhere<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.060> want<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.980> only

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
it anywhere you want but the only

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.890 
it anywhere you want but the only
downside<00:05:51.610> of<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:51.790> is<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.270> sits<00:05:52.600> on<00:05:52.780> the

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
downside of this is it sits on the

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.020 
downside of this is it sits on the
ground<00:05:53.200> or<00:05:53.350> on<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.590> bench<00:05:53.860> near<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.730> and<00:05:54.880> it's

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
ground or on the bench near you and it's

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.950 
ground or on the bench near you and it's
relatively<00:05:55.690> low<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.640> ground<00:05:57.780> when<00:05:58.780> it's

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
relatively low to the ground when it's

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.950 
relatively low to the ground when it's
low<00:05:59.140> to<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.410> ground<00:05:59.520> sometimes<00:06:00.520> your<00:06:01.390> signals

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
low to the ground sometimes your signals

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.590 
low to the ground sometimes your signals
you<00:06:02.410> know<00:06:02.500> can<00:06:02.740> be<00:06:02.770> overtaken<00:06:03.669> by<00:06:03.700> objects

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
you know can be overtaken by objects

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.679
