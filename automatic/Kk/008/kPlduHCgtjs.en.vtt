smell trying no of for iron ore is in
white<00:04:17.670> right<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.470> just<00:04:19.470> behind<00:04:19.830> where<00:04:20.190> this

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
white right so just behind where this

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
camera lies there is smelter so you just

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.620 
camera lies there is smelter so you just
want<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.160> do<00:04:23.310> your<00:04:23.490> iron<00:04:23.700> ore<00:04:23.880> there<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.360> also

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
want to do your iron ore there and also

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.260 
want to do your iron ore there and also
the<00:04:24.720> I've<00:04:25.080> changed<00:04:25.470> place<00:04:25.650> again<00:04:25.980> this

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the I've changed place again this

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.550 
the I've changed place again this
basically<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.390> idea<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.020> guys<00:04:28.200> just

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
basically the idea of it guys just

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.830 
basically the idea of it guys just
basically<00:04:29.160> once<00:04:29.850> you're<00:04:30.030> done<00:04:30.210> with<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.810> your

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
basically once you're done with all your

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.310 
basically once you're done with all your
materials<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:32.010> want<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.610> change<00:04:33.510> place<00:04:33.840> until

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
materials you want to change place until

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.840 
materials you want to change place until
you<00:04:34.410> run<00:04:34.560> out<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.770> money<00:04:34.980> once<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.430> run<00:04:35.640> out<00:04:35.670> of

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
you run out of money once you run out of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.630 
you run out of money once you run out of
money<00:04:36.000> obviously<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:37.620> go<00:04:37.800> do<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.160> dawn<00:04:38.340> star

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
money obviously you go do the dawn star

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.120 
money obviously you go do the dawn star
chest<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.090> few<00:04:39.270> times

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
chest a few times

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.450 
chest a few times
I<00:04:40.160> think<00:04:40.910> Maya<00:04:41.180> my<00:04:42.050> estimate<00:04:42.590> money<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.890> got<00:04:43.310> are

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
I think Maya my estimate money I got are

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.120 
I think Maya my estimate money I got are
new<00:04:43.790> every<00:04:44.120> time<00:04:44.330> when<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.020> went<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.470> change<00:04:45.740> is

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
new every time when I went to change is

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.800 
new every time when I went to change is
at<00:04:46.280> least<00:04:48.970> three<00:04:49.970> thousand<00:04:50.450> eight<00:04:50.600> hundred

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
at least three thousand eight hundred

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.310 
at least three thousand eight hundred
gold<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:52.270> generally<00:04:53.270> gets<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:54.020> good

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
gold that generally gets you a good

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.920 
gold that generally gets you a good
amount<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.680> Inga<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.280> lever<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.540> need<00:04:56.720> it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
amount of Inga and lever if you need it

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.320 
amount of Inga and lever if you need it
and<00:04:57.220> all<00:04:58.220> if<00:04:59.090> possible<00:05:00.460> yeah<00:05:01.460> this<00:05:01.790> game<00:05:02.150> is

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
and all if possible yeah this game is

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.360 
and all if possible yeah this game is
played<00:05:02.570> every<00:05:03.080> time<00:05:03.410> you've<00:05:03.620> done<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.830> as<00:05:04.220> you

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
played every time you've done it as you

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.190 
played every time you've done it as you
can<00:05:04.460> see<00:05:04.520> leverage<00:05:05.120> then<00:05:05.600> we've<00:05:05.720> got<00:05:05.960> quite

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
can see leverage then we've got quite

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.590 
can see leverage then we've got quite
quick<00:05:06.500> fire<00:05:07.010> obviously<00:05:07.790> had<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.300> cut<00:05:08.450> out

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
quick fire obviously had to cut out

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.630 
quick fire obviously had to cut out
because<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:09.080> takes<00:05:09.350> a<00:05:09.410> lot<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.590> time<00:05:09.830> but<00:05:10.070> yes

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
because it takes a lot of time but yes

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.530 
because it takes a lot of time but yes
the<00:05:10.820> levels<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.270> got<00:05:11.570> quite<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> lot<00:05:13.210> my<00:05:14.210> fast

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
the levels do got quite a lot my fast

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.230 
the levels do got quite a lot my fast
actually<00:05:15.170> I'm<00:05:15.650> fine<00:05:16.100> this<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.520> like<00:05:16.730> I<00:05:16.970> think

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
actually I'm fine this is like I think

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.560 
actually I'm fine this is like I think
out<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:18.670> apart<00:05:19.670> from<00:05:19.790> lock-picking

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
out of apart from lock-picking

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.810 
out of apart from lock-picking
which<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.050> will<00:05:21.230> be<00:05:21.380> doing<00:05:21.680> next<00:05:23.230> this<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.830> or

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
which I will be doing next this is or

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.190 
which I will be doing next this is or
has<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.540> be<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.900> fastest<00:05:27.710> skill<00:05:28.160> that<00:05:28.490> goes<00:05:28.730> up

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
has to be the fastest skill that goes up

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.780 
has to be the fastest skill that goes up
is

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
is

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.260 
is

and I I don't know I just how they media

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.720 
and I I don't know I just how they media
against<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:36.050> rate<00:05:36.260> of<00:05:36.560> how<00:05:36.920> it<00:05:37.070> goes<00:05:37.250> up<00:05:37.310> and

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
against the rate of how it goes up and

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.800 
against the rate of how it goes up and
there's<00:05:37.940> your<00:05:38.090> level<00:05:38.330> 100<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.910> now<00:05:41.360> for<00:05:41.780> a
