00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.269
 the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.660
 but he was not alone 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.489
 it was not just the dinosaurs 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.400
 first the dinosaurs do not have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.439
 actually gone since birds are dinosaurs sega dinosaurs 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.330
 no aviens 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.180
 we disappeared 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.440
 and then there are many other animals that have also disappeared from reptiles 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.990
 flounces 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.490
 the great marine reptiles 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 and invertebrates the ammonites 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 summer terra 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.730
 so many animals in all about 70% of the species of the late Cretaceous 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.950
 disparate 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.240
 so why 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.740
 we can say that to three major factors that have made that 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 otc disappear 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.320
 15 million years before the end of the Cretaceous and green at 70 million 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.899
 years 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.360
 we have a cooling 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 the temperature drops and we know that many of these reptiles are 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.440
 cold-blooded animals 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.280
 and so maybe we can adapt to variations of 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 temperature 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 the second very important factor and volcanism 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.450
 about two million years before the end of the high school era the end of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 Cretaceous around 67 million years ago 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.710
 a very important model is taking shape in India 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 and so millions of angry cubic kilometers of lava that are emitted 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.920
 at the end of the Cretaceium then at that time India is not attached to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.990
 Asia the arrival of an Iberian plate 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.070
 and who will they bump against asia 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.240
 but at that moment she passes 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.670
 at the location of the meeting that mans 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.770
 and why this Tuesday the meeting on Thursday what's called a hot spot 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 it's as if you had a camel's earthly crust 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.490
 and as for the meal going on 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 it's the Persian torch 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 therefore projects volcanic materialization 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.689
 Everytime 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.290
 that this place 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.340
 so soltani was not volcanic ash that was projecting an ossuary 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.590
 but this is extremely acidic gas 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.189
 2 of the sulfuric acid of the city sent 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.200
 this state that are projected into the atmosphere 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.280
 and who forms 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.160
 helped by aerosols these aerosols 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.339
 thousands of years we start cursus 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.739
 the lapd the planet 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.499
 m mask the sun's rays 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.819
 and we do not find ourselves in front of this phenomenon that we call various nuclear 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.710
 that is, we have 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.570
 the light that happens less on the wall of the sun that penetrates less on the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.050
 Earth 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.060
 and therefore necessarily the vegetation the euro takes a blow too 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.910
 equalization become scarce and so all that creates big disturbances 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.390
 in the third food chains the herbivorous dinosaurs are are 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.819
 affected the big serbia are assigned to them so carnivores site 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.819
 and when we have a break in the food chain 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.590
 third element so that's right at the end of the Cretaceous 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.659
 it's an element that gives the coup de grace by some groups 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 try shiatsu 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.449
 a huge meteorite 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.669
 on the ground 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.939
 a meteorite that was about 10 to 15 km in diameter 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.719
 which was expected to pose about 1000 billion tons 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.979
 who arrives with a speed of 15 km seconds 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.509
 that hits the land north of the katanga in the titus lobby area 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.989
 in the gulf of mexico 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 and 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.480
 at impact 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.109
 it is estimated that the temperature was about 10 to 20 thousand degrees 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.419
 that is, all the rock 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.459
 and the meteorite and that crater rock of 200 meters of santis the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.049
 diameter meter in depth also a few kilometers under the departure and 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:29.900
 all supposed 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.680
 spray cfa to break in the atmosphere and we have microphones 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.129
 to refound which darken the atmosphere for several months 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.749
 maybe even several years 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.099
 so their loved ones and my various nuclear on already a biodiversity 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.550
 who was affected by 600 million robberies started saying no 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.240
 that's enough 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.580
 in the vicinity in the east in the 5000 km around the fall of this 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.150
 meteorite it was catastrophic blues of the elected ones canceled 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.850
 tidal wave with waves of 30 meters high flight tremors 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.600
 absolutely absolutely the standards this 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.820
 mass of particulate matter projected into the atmosphere 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.370
 found all over the planet we find them everywhere wherever we find 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.469
 in australia in new zealand everywhere 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.789
 his securex dress so so that 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:14.529
 the planet for the time at least a year maybe even more than several 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:15.769
 month maybe year 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.389
 and therefore we can not make the lightning war so the vegetation is 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.140
 scarce 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.130
 so food chain the vegetarians 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.380
 no longer to eat your down-to-earth and there 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.499
 once again the big beasts are necessarily more affected because 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.869
 a dinosaur of this size for now it's nice that they're not eating 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:34.949
 salads a day but 2000 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.080
 so 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.590
 it has to eat here has more food to eat so it dies and if the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.500
 herbivorous dinosaurs leading the carnivores of rossi was will pay 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.090
 and therefore breaking of the food chain 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.219
 the same way in an oceanic environment 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.899
 all the phytoplankton stops the microscopic algae those who live in 

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:52.839
 the ocean which is very very abundant which produce the vast majority of 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.139
 the oxygen at the moment is phytoplankton and therefore this phytoplankton 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.729
 is decimated 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.020
 and therefore breaking food chains in an oceanic environment 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.590
 the same thing and so there then it was the coup de grace to the voyeurs we have 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.250
 three 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.590
 three elements at least two of the frames in any case a lowering of the 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.339
 temperature that begins long before the end of the Cretaceous 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.240
 about a million and a half million before the end of the USSR 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.510
 before the end of the Cretaceous 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.120
 at volketswil very important with help acid rain and aerosol 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.950
 in the atmosphere and then the fall of a meteorite from 10 to 15 km from 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.449
 diameter 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.400
 finally just at 65 million 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 which gives the coup de grace to many to many animals 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.729
 berlin percent 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.069
