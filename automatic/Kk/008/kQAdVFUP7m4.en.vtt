that<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.010> were<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.160> run<00:04:32.400> off<00:04:32.580> with<00:04:32.910> this

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that so if I were to run off with this

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.030 
that so if I were to run off with this
power<00:04:33.300> pole<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.720> go<00:04:33.930> put<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.140> in<00:04:34.290> my<00:04:34.380> boat<00:04:34.590> you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
power pole and go put it in my boat you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.960
