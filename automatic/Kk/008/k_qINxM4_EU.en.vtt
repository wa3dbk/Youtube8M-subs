just<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.280> through<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> layer<00:00:51.420> styles<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
just go through the layer styles you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.729 
just go through the layer styles you
need<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> first<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:56.460> drop<00:00:57.030> shadow<00:00:57.239> checked

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
need so first have drop shadow checked

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
need so first have drop shadow checked
when<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> need<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> blend<00:00:59.370> mode<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> be<00:01:00.359> on

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
when you need the blend mode to be on

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.619 
when you need the blend mode to be on
multiply<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.949> pacity<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.910> 75<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
multiply you pacity to be on 75 in the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
multiply you pacity to be on 75 in the
color<00:01:03.870> left<00:01:04.290> black<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.860> should<00:01:05.040> all<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
color left black that should all be the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.899 
color left black that should all be the
same<00:01:05.519> um<00:01:06.500> make<00:01:07.500> sure<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:08.130> global<00:01:08.430> light<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
same um make sure use global light is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.990 
same um make sure use global light is
checked<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.869> angle<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.320> 120<00:01:11.000> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
checked and the angle is at 120 the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.289 
checked and the angle is at 120 the
distance<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> 3<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.500> spread<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.040> 34<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
distance is 3 the spread is 34 and the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.160 
distance is 3 the spread is 34 and the
size<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.930> 21<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.880> adjust<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.110> not

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
size is 21 you can adjust this it's not

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
size is 21 you can adjust this it's not
too<00:01:19.830> big<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.549> using<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
too big video if you're using it on a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
too big video if you're using it on a
you<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.080> big<00:01:22.110> canvas<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.070> looks<00:01:23.369> too

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you know big canvas and that looks too

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.780 
you know big canvas and that looks too
small<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:24.030> too<00:01:24.150> big<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.259> adjust<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.790> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
small or too big you can adjust that but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.039 
small or too big you can adjust that but
um<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:27.750> simple<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.520> shadow

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
um yeah that's pretty simple in a shadow

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.990 
um yeah that's pretty simple in a shadow
you<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.430> you'll<00:01:32.430> need<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> blend<00:01:32.970> mode

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you will have you'll need the blend mode

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
you will have you'll need the blend mode
to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.299> set<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> linear<00:01:34.049> burn<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:35.040> pass<00:01:35.220> key

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to be set to linear burn your pass key

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
to be set to linear burn your pass key
to<00:01:35.549> 37<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.040> color<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> darkish

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to 37 and the color is kind of darkish

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
to 37 and the color is kind of darkish
blue<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.970> here's<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> code<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.930> pause

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
blue and here's the code you can pause

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
blue and here's the code you can pause
the<00:01:43.350> video<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> check<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the video to check it so that is the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
the video to check it so that is the
inner<00:01:48.570> shadow<00:01:48.979> distance<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.250> size<00:01:50.549> 2<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
inner shadow distance for size 2 and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.620 
inner shadow distance for size 2 and
choke<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.750> 0<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:53.250> won't<00:01:53.430> need<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
choke at 0 you won't need now to go but

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
choke at 0 you won't need now to go but
you<00:01:54.720> will<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> integral<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> inner

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you will in integral so for the inner

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.130 
you will in integral so for the inner
glow<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> linear<00:01:58.530> dodge<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
glow you want to have a linear dodge the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.210 
glow you want to have a linear dodge the
opacity<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.740> 60<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> blend<00:02:03.840> mode<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.950> white

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
opacity at 60 the blend mode just white

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
opacity at 60 the blend mode just white
make<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> technique<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.360> precise

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200

the<00:02:12.849> choke<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.660> 50<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.290> sizes<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.860> too<00:02:15.069> and

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
the choke is on 50 and sizes on too and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.270 
the choke is on 50 and sizes on too and
I'd<00:02:17.349> make<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> range<00:02:18.550> go<00:02:18.910> up<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.209> 100<00:02:20.280> actually

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
I'd make the range go up to 100 actually

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
I'd make the range go up to 100 actually
it<00:02:21.400> for<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.140> go-go<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:24.550> for<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.910> bevel<00:02:25.180> and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
it for the go-go now for the bevel and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.110 
it for the go-go now for the bevel and
emboss<00:02:26.099> there's<00:02:27.099> quite<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.459> lot<00:02:27.610> sangjun

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
emboss there's quite a lot sangjun

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.770 
emboss there's quite a lot sangjun
exchange<00:02:28.540> here<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.340> yeah<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.030> pause

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
exchange here so then we yeah just pause

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.280 
exchange here so then we yeah just pause
the<00:02:31.930> video<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.530> know<00:02:32.680> opening<00:02:33.430> form<00:02:33.850> do<00:02:34.030> ever

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
the video you know opening form do ever

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.350 
the video you know opening form do ever
so<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.319> style<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.040> want<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.520> inner<00:02:36.880> bevel<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so the style you want is inner bevel the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.050 
so the style you want is inner bevel the
technique<00:02:37.900> too<00:02:38.830> hard<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.640> depth<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
technique too hard and the depth of a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.420 
technique too hard and the depth of a
thousand<00:02:40.450> percent<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.709> direction<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.400> want

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
thousand percent the direction you want

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.990 
thousand percent the direction you want
is<00:02:42.970> up<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.950> size<00:02:44.950> around<00:02:45.810> 150<00:02:46.810> um<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.670> depends

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
is up and size around 150 um it depends

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.729 
is up and size around 150 um it depends
again<00:02:49.300> what<00:02:49.510> besides<00:02:49.989> canvas<00:02:50.380> you're<00:02:50.560> using

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
again what besides canvas you're using

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.870 
again what besides canvas you're using
on<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.060> want<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:53.190> they<00:02:54.190> kind<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.610> meat

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
on but you want it so they kind of meat

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.600 
on but you want it so they kind of meat
so<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.900> don't<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:56.739> know<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.950> describe

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
so it's I don't really know to describe

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.289 
so it's I don't really know to describe
it<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.910> pyramid<00:02:58.209> shape<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.620> if<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.459> go

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
it like a pyramid shape so if I just go

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.390 
it like a pyramid shape so if I just go
away<00:03:01.390> from<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.780> quickly<00:03:02.019> for<00:03:02.890> zoom<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.250> you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
away from that quickly for zoom in you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.390 
away from that quickly for zoom in you
can<00:03:03.430> see<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:05.200> orange<00:03:05.620> part<00:03:05.890> here<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.280> this

is<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.470> code<00:04:03.959> um<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.769> that's<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
is the code um so that's it for the

bevel emboss you can change it up a bit

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.819 
bevel emboss you can change it up a bit
I<00:04:08.680> sometimes<00:04:09.420> like<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:11.139> know<00:04:11.260> making<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.680> bit

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
I sometimes like you know making a bit

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.620 
I sometimes like you know making a bit
darker<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.400> looks<00:04:12.579> quite<00:04:12.790> cool<00:04:12.819> but<00:04:13.180> again

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
darker that looks quite cool but again

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.110 
darker that looks quite cool but again
this<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.930> just<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.290> show<00:04:14.319> on<00:04:14.819> how<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.880> make<00:04:16.090> the

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
this is just to show on how to make the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.310 
this is just to show on how to make the
like<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.289> starcraft<00:04:17.799> logo<00:04:18.070> itself<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:20.200> you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
like the starcraft logo itself so you

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.879 
like the starcraft logo itself so you
must<00:04:20.560> file<00:04:20.709> them<00:04:20.950> yourself

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
must file them yourself

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.649 
must file them yourself
once<00:04:24.069> you've<00:04:24.219> done<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.550> bevel<00:04:24.789> emboss<00:04:24.879> go<00:04:25.599> to

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
once you've done the bevel emboss go to

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.790 
once you've done the bevel emboss go to
Saturn<00:04:27.210> make<00:04:28.210> sure<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.689> blend<00:04:28.960> mode<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.530> set

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
to multiply the color is at black and

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.339 
to multiply the color is at black and

19 distance at six and size eight and

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.820 
19 distance at six and size eight and
you<00:04:39.759> want<00:04:39.939> the<00:04:40.029> contour<00:04:40.509> to<00:04:40.900> be<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.169> kind<00:04:41.650> of

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
you want the contour to be this kind of

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.800 
you want the contour to be this kind of
a<00:04:41.949> concave<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.699> here<00:04:42.939> and<00:04:45.060> make<00:04:46.060> sure<00:04:46.090> invert

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
a concave on here and make sure invert

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.629 
a concave on here and make sure invert
is<00:04:47.050> checked<00:04:47.349> otherwise<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.009> would<00:04:48.099> look<00:04:48.189> a<00:04:48.249> bit

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
is checked otherwise it would look a bit

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.839 
is checked otherwise it would look a bit
weird<00:04:48.879> like<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:50.129> that's<00:04:51.129> it<00:04:51.310> for<00:04:51.370> satin

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
weird like this and that's it for satin

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.499 
weird like this and that's it for satin
and<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:53.669> don't<00:04:54.669> think<00:04:54.879> yeah<00:04:55.029> the<00:04:55.180> pattern

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
and I don't think yeah the pattern

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.610 
and I don't think yeah the pattern
overlay<00:04:55.719> doesn't<00:04:56.199> actually<00:04:56.469> matter<00:04:58.620> because

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
overlay doesn't actually matter because

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.649 
overlay doesn't actually matter because
you're<00:04:59.860> going<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.039> be<00:05:00.129> adding<00:05:00.279> some<00:05:01.210> layer

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
you're going to be adding some layer

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.719 
you're going to be adding some layer
stars<00:05:01.960> on<00:05:02.110> after<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.250> once<00:05:03.400> you've<00:05:03.520> done<00:05:03.669> that

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
stars on after so once you've done that

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.420 
stars on after so once you've done that
you<00:05:04.029> should<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.240> something<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.979> looks<00:05:06.189> a<00:05:06.310> bit

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
you should have something it looks a bit

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.700 
you should have something it looks a bit
like<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.789> looks<00:05:07.689> I<00:05:07.960> mean<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.469> looks<00:05:08.529> pretty

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
like this looks I mean it looks pretty

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.499 
like this looks I mean it looks pretty
cool<00:05:08.949> it<00:05:09.159> doesn't<00:05:09.430> look<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.580> media<00:05:10.120> star

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
cool it doesn't look like media star

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.670 
cool it doesn't look like media star
crushed<00:05:11.430> last<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.639> was<00:05:12.759> a<00:05:12.789> moment<00:05:13.379> so<00:05:14.379> once

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
crushed last I was a moment so once

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.939 
crushed last I was a moment so once
you've<00:05:14.830> done<00:05:14.949> that<00:05:16.379> you<00:05:17.379> know<00:05:17.439> dragging<00:05:17.889> a

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
you've done that you know dragging a

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.070 
you've done that you know dragging a
texture<00:05:18.659> think<00:05:19.659> I<00:05:19.900> used<00:05:20.849> any<00:05:21.849> one<00:05:22.569> will<00:05:22.810> do

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
texture think I used any one will do

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.140 
texture think I used any one will do
really<00:05:23.409> and<00:05:24.719> I'll<00:05:25.719> go<00:05:25.900> takes<00:05:26.349> you<00:05:26.499> to<00:05:26.969> this<00:05:27.969> one

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
really and I'll go takes you to this one

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.379 
really and I'll go takes you to this one
looks<00:05:28.330> quite<00:05:28.539> nice<00:05:29.610> so<00:05:30.610> as<00:05:30.879> long<00:05:31.000> it's<00:05:31.180> near

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
looks quite nice so as long it's near

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.170 
looks quite nice so as long it's near
big<00:05:31.659> texture<00:05:32.139> it's<00:05:32.379> like<00:05:32.529> this<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.770> can

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
big texture it's like this you can

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.249 
big texture it's like this you can
stretch<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.210> out<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.539> it<00:05:34.659> so<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:34.900> covers<00:05:35.050> the

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
stretch it out of it so it covers the

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.790 
stretch it out of it so it covers the
whole<00:05:35.289> text<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:40.289> I'll<00:05:41.289> just<00:05:41.439> check<00:05:41.620> what

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
whole text and you I'll just check what

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.219 
whole text and you I'll just check what
this<00:05:41.919> looks<00:05:42.159> like<00:05:42.250> but<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:43.360> get<00:05:43.960> rid<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.139> the

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
this looks like but to get rid of the

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.619 
this looks like but to get rid of the
edges<00:05:44.529> around<00:05:45.159> text<00:05:45.759> you<00:05:46.060> want<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.360> be<00:05:46.449> holding

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
edges around text you want to be holding

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.050 
edges around text you want to be holding
command<00:05:47.020> or<00:05:47.289> control<00:05:47.710> click<00:05:48.550> on<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:48.849> text

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
command or control click on the text

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.659 
command or control click on the text
layer<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.629> little<00:05:49.839> T<00:05:50.349> icon<00:05:50.680> here<00:05:50.889> should

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
layer the little T icon here should

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.570 
layer the little T icon here should
bring<00:05:51.849> up<00:05:51.969> a<00:05:52.060> selection<00:05:52.740> press<00:05:53.740> command<00:05:54.219> shift

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
bring up a selection press command shift

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.290 
bring up a selection press command shift
an<00:05:55.449> eye<00:05:55.719> or<00:05:56.129> selecting<00:05:57.129> bus<00:05:57.279> and<00:05:57.699> bring<00:05:58.149> up<00:05:58.210> the

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
an eye or selecting bus and bring up the

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.369 
an eye or selecting bus and bring up the
selection<00:05:58.719> around<00:05:58.899> it<00:05:59.319> and<00:05:59.830> ship<00:06:00.460> delete<00:06:01.379> so

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
selection around it and ship delete so

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.719 
selection around it and ship delete so
it<00:06:02.469> just<00:06:02.500> leaves<00:06:02.830> you<00:06:02.979> with<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.339> texture<00:06:03.969> and

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
it just leaves you with the texture and

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.700 
it just leaves you with the texture and
second<00:06:06.729> you<00:06:07.000> just<00:06:07.300> need<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.539> layer<00:06:08.169> style<00:06:08.469> to

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
second you just need the layer style to

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.499 
second you just need the layer style to
be<00:06:08.830> set<00:06:09.099> at<00:06:09.399> hard<00:06:09.759> light<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:13.000> can<00:06:13.029> turn

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
be set at hard light so you can turn

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.339 
be set at hard light so you can turn
that<00:06:13.719> down<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.050> bit<00:06:15.389> I'm<00:06:16.389> not<00:06:16.539> sure<00:06:16.719> how<00:06:16.990> much<00:06:17.199> I

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
that down a bit I'm not sure how much I

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.570 
that down a bit I'm not sure how much I
on<00:06:17.649> here<00:06:18.000> um<00:06:19.620> yeah<00:06:20.620> turn<00:06:20.949> up<00:06:21.099> down<00:06:21.339> what

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
on here um yeah turn up down what

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.929 
on here um yeah turn up down what
everything<00:06:22.060> looks<00:06:22.240> good<00:06:22.419> I<00:06:23.399> added<00:06:24.399> two

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
everything looks good I added two

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.230 
everything looks good I added two
textures<00:06:25.449> here<00:06:25.870> so<00:06:26.199> this<00:06:26.439> is<00:06:26.589> the<00:06:26.680> first<00:06:26.949> one

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
textures here so this is the first one

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.879 
textures here so this is the first one
it's<00:06:28.240> just<00:06:28.449> kind<00:06:28.750> of<00:06:28.839> a<00:06:28.930> regular<00:06:29.319> grunge<00:06:29.589> in

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
it's just kind of a regular grunge in

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.129 
it's just kind of a regular grunge in
then<00:06:30.039> this<00:06:30.219> one's<00:06:30.399> a<00:06:30.520> bit<00:06:30.639> more<00:06:30.759> grainy<00:06:31.120> but<00:06:32.080> I

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
then this one's a bit more grainy but I

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.959 
then this one's a bit more grainy but I
do<00:06:32.199> like<00:06:32.440> this<00:06:32.589> one<00:06:32.769> this<00:06:32.919> is<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.159> Batson

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
do like this one this is the Batson

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.679 
do like this one this is the Batson
whatever<00:06:34.269> it's<00:06:34.389> called

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689 
whatever it's called

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.369 
whatever it's called
for<00:06:35.929> this<00:06:36.049> one<00:06:36.439> I<00:06:36.469> used<00:06:37.089> color<00:06:38.089> dodge<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:39.080> set

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
for this one I used color dodge and set

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.219 
for this one I used color dodge and set
the<00:06:39.529> opacity<00:06:39.649> to<00:06:40.189> 65<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.539> yeah<00:06:41.689> so<00:06:41.869> i<00:06:41.899> recommend

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
the opacity to 65 so yeah so i recommend

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.069 
the opacity to 65 so yeah so i recommend
guys<00:06:42.529> really<00:06:42.830> use<00:06:43.009> two<00:06:43.279> textures<00:06:43.839> make<00:06:44.839> one

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:45.079 
guys really use two textures make one

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:48.189

and then i'm a problem like this one
more<00:06:52.579> grainy<00:06:52.909> kind<00:06:53.269> of<00:06:53.360> thing<00:06:53.539> and<00:06:53.689> the<00:06:54.589> this

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
more grainy kind of thing and the this

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.309 
more grainy kind of thing and the this
one<00:06:55.159> have<00:06:55.610> it<00:06:55.729> set<00:06:55.969> to<00:06:55.999> color<00:06:56.299> dodge<00:06:56.569> and<00:06:57.110> a

one have it set to color dodge and a
pasty<00:06:57.709> at<00:06:57.829> 65<00:06:58.429> you<00:06:59.360> can<00:06:59.509> mess<00:06:59.659> with<00:06:59.809> the

00:06:59.919 --> 00:06:59.929 
pasty at 65 you can mess with the

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:01.959 
pasty at 65 you can mess with the
blending<00:07:00.409> modes<00:07:00.589> like<00:07:00.860> they'll<00:07:01.519> put<00:07:01.699> this<00:07:01.789> to

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:01.969 
blending modes like they'll put this to

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.179 
blending modes like they'll put this to
overlay<00:07:02.479> to<00:07:03.229> kind<00:07:03.409> of<00:07:03.439> darkens<00:07:03.919> the<00:07:04.009> whole

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:04.189 
overlay to kind of darkens the whole

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.149 
overlay to kind of darkens the whole
thing<00:07:04.459> hard<00:07:05.209> light<00:07:05.539> see<00:07:06.469> I<00:07:06.529> think<00:07:06.709> color<00:07:06.949> dodge

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
thing hard light see I think color dodge

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.319 
thing hard light see I think color dodge
