what's that way and burn here with our

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.309 
what's that way and burn here with our
face<00:00:02.250> dotnet<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.090> we<00:00:03.270> are<00:00:03.419> inside<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.959> 3d

face dotnet and we are inside of 3d
studio<00:00:04.529> max<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.430> we're<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> be

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
studio max and we're going to be

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.530 
studio max and we're going to be
creating<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:07.020> box<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.730> see<00:00:08.970> our<00:00:09.000> box

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
creating this box as you can see our box

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.030 
creating this box as you can see our box
has<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.349> width<00:00:11.219> inside<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.300> its<00:00:12.769> center<00:00:13.769> most

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
has a width inside of its center most

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.760 
has a width inside of its center most
part<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.719> also<00:00:15.719> our<00:00:16.369> top<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.770> extrusion

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
part and also our top has a extrusion

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.370 
part and also our top has a extrusion
going<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> way<00:00:20.430> around<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.380> levels

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
going all the way around it and levels

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
going all the way around it and levels
on<00:00:22.650> each<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.150> let's<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.510> ahead<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
on each side so let's go ahead and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.929 
on each side so let's go ahead and
create<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.529> box<00:00:25.830> that's<00:00:26.220> moving<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
create this box that's moving here to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
create this box that's moving here to
New<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.859> choose<00:00:28.859> no<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.849> new<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.250> then

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
New and choose no and new to all then

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.709 
New and choose no and new to all then
let's<00:00:32.460> come<00:00:32.610> over<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.180> reset

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
let's come over here and reset

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.130 
let's come over here and reset
everything<00:00:34.399> yes<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.660> come<00:00:36.870> over<00:00:36.899> here

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
everything yes and then come over here

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
everything yes and then come over here
to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> bottom<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> toggle<00:00:38.879> the

viewport and then on our top view select
it<00:00:42.600> may<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> cheese<00:00:44.010> box<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:44.910> our

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it may be here and cheese box from our

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
it may be here and cheese box from our
standard<00:00:45.510> primitives<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> let's<00:00:47.730> go

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
standard primitives and then let's go

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.430 
standard primitives and then let's go
ahead<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.239> create<00:00:48.629> our<00:00:49.070> box<00:00:52.370> route

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.709

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
let's get enough let off front and then

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.259 
let's get enough let off front and then
drag<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.079> up<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.890> about<00:01:01.100> right<00:01:01.280> up<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.760> darreth
