00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 or the people of outside seals but that 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.410
 find very well since in this 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.230
 occasion we are going to talk about the new movie 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.700
 starring blake lively the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.700
 adelaide secret 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 i 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.200
 as I mentioned at the beginning is being 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.720
 is starring lively blake 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.070
 nicole kidman and harrison by 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.750
 mainly and this story of adam 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 lines is basically going to be something like 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 and if Adelita went with another one and this one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 feel is going to be basically a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.100
 combination between romance and fantasy a 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.350
 kind of superhero something like that but not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 not just with superpowers but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 we have the story of this girl 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.120
 who was born in the USA at the beginning of the century 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.970
 20 and from suffering an accident 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.030
 is stuck at a certain age that is 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.220
 who suffered this accident 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.440
 automobile at the age of 29 years and 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.980
 from that day to many years 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.239
 forward alain is going to be 29 years old now 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 The first thing that I should mention is that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.369
 was very surprised about this movie was the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 actress blake lively with whom in fact 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 my first approach was with the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 movie of the sisterhood of the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 traveling pants a movie 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 very special also that in fact I 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 I liked it a lot and it also appeared by 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 course in the gossip series see that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.150
 only many of you remember her 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 more for this role and I when I saw that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 I was going to be the protagonist of this film 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 I figured it was going to be more than anything 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 like a little kid with a story very 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.330
 predictable but not clear is that I'm 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.149
 quite surprised with what I saw in 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.100
 this movie because even though yes 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.229
 is going to be about a love story and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.869
 let's see this character involved 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.090
 with another person with a name that enters 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.429
 in your life it is not exactly a chip 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 flick because something that I really liked is 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.200
 that has a nostalgic tone all the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.030
 movie the setting the performances 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.220
 the way in which it develops 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.100
 the history and even the time that 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.899
 Take each sequence is very nostalgic and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.909
 I think it conveys a very good 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.340
 form that feeling that the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 character to feel that his time has passed 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.670
 who is in a place where he does not 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 he belongs he feels that he can no longer 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 fit in society because always 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.580
 he has to be fleeing from the place in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.380
 that is not to be discovered and I 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.620
 I really like the way it is transmitted 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.769
 this feeling of the protagonist 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.819
 that of course has its bad sides 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.430
 since some people can 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.769
 be boring not only because it is 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.230
 slow the movie if it's slow but 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.540
 because if you do not empathize with the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.769
 main character or you do not like it or the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.140
 story is simply not you 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.590
 interesting can it really be a 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.200
 pretty boring movie for the time 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.390
 what you need to get into the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.280
 emotions of alain taking into account that 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.140
 this girl has gone through different 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.610
 focus it is obvious that you have a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.040
 wider knowledge than that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.930
 we have you and me or any other 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.540
 person because he has lived several events 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.910
 historical and that is why he knows many 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.370
 things about language history and 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.989
 et cetera etcetera and I liked that it is a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.790
 good balance the one he has in the movie 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.859
 no extras that give in putting it as a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 know-it-all even though if you have a 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.659
 Broad knowledge but do not overdo it 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.849
 in coincidences or in exposing that 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.250
 this character is an Albert einsten something 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.200
 well a bit like it happens in forrest gump 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 where there are many coincidences here 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 you do not abuse that because personally 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.750
 I do not love it when 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.520
 Attacks a lot the character that knows 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.560
 many things or that they would overcome 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.440
 I think it 's a very good balance between what 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.480
 entertaining and the logical inside the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.209
 same story on the other hand I like it 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.800
 that the story despite being quite 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.570
 foreseeable in certain aspects some 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.660
 very tiny some a little more 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.070
 obvious and has this surprise effect in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.990
 several parts of the story which I 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.580
 I liked it a lot because I feel like it's always 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.650
 It is necessary for a story to surprise us 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.750
 or that does not go along the line of what 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.030
 we already knew that it was going to happen by the way 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.260
 I recommend that you do not see the trailer if 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.300
 they are interested in this movie because the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.620
 trailer is can ruin many things 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.560
 I do not go between the before the movie 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.750
 I saw it later and I said good and clear 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 why you've ruined a lot of 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.190
 the movie so please do not watch the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.140
 trailer and on the other hand I like clear 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.500
 that is a woman the protagonist but 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.760
 again we fall back into the cliché 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.459
 Hollywood that despite the fact that the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.070
 girls to the protagonist is very da for 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 a male behavior or by a 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.230
 Ideal to reach male if you are interested 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.270
 in fact this topic I want to recommend you 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.910
 quickly a documentary that are 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.280
 it's called my representation of the role of 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
 the woman in the cinema is very interesting 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.389
 see how here also apply that theory 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.949
 that is managed and I recommend that you see it and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.479
 Finally, even though I like it a lot 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.610
 the setting of the movie the 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.710
 wardrobe makeup I love everything 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.389
 the way they dress her to 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.680
 soon does not make much sense because there 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.409
 a moment in which we travel the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.599
 decade of the 60s and is dressed in this 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.180
 sixty way but when we come back to 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.699
 2014 she is dressed as a beginner 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.310
 of the 20th century again and good unless 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.620
 that is hipster this does not have as much 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.300
 logic within the same narrative of 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.830
 the movie even though it looks very 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.419
 ok but like he does not have much 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.680
 meaning out of it the truth is that 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.050
 I thought it was a very interesting story 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.190
 it was very different from the experience at 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.530
 that I thought I was going to see this 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.780
 movie I love the performances and 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.240
 in the end I think you 're left with a good 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.740
 feeling a good feeling so if 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.630
 you call the attention that first 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.750
 I recommend that you see it and that's why I 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.520
 I give four stars out of five I'm from 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.009
 Tell me what you think about this plane 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.449
 movie and tell me even if they are men 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.720
 It does not matter because we all like 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.840
 clicks 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.880
 if preferred or perhaps the least 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.320
 is desperate to see and they say down here 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.820
 on the comments 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.620
