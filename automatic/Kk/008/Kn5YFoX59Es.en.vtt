technique called piping and this is so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.660 
technique called piping and this is so
simple<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> makeshift<00:02:08.140> bag<00:02:09.069> it's<00:02:09.459> not

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
simple this is a makeshift bag it's not

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.550 
simple this is a makeshift bag it's not
a<00:02:09.700> real<00:02:10.030> piping<00:02:10.509> bag<00:02:10.689> but<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> will<00:02:11.170> tell<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.470> it

a real piping bag but I will tell you it
works<00:02:11.769> every<00:02:12.189> bit<00:02:12.370> as<00:02:12.489> good<00:02:12.669> as<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.419> much

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
works every bit as good as and it's much

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.390 
works every bit as good as and it's much
easier<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:14.230> almost<00:02:14.709> all<00:02:14.859> of<00:02:14.889> us<00:02:15.099> have<00:02:15.249> these

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
easier and almost all of us have these

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.489 
easier and almost all of us have these
dip<00:02:15.609> lock<00:02:15.790> bags<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.329> our<00:02:16.419> drawers<00:02:16.779> so<00:02:17.379> I'm
