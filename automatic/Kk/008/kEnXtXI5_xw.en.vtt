00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.609
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.710
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:17.160
 I will tell you about what summer 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 inoculating and how to do them right for 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 beginners will say what is the vaccination with 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.279
 using vaccinations you can actually 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 any sort you like to have 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 yourself in the garden 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.460
 moreover on one tree you can 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.439
 have several varieties 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 vaccinations are different at different times their 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 use and spring and summer and autumn but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.489
 Here summer vaccination is considered the most 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.190
 simple and it is available even for beginners 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.719
 inexperienced not only in this tide there 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.789
 a lot of advantages here you do not need 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.930
 harvesting a lot of cuttings is enough 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.350
 single cutting 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.079
 to prepare some of it 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 little eyes these little eyes 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.410
 we will plant today to the tree 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 This summer vaccine is called 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 grafting budding and the example of an apple tree 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.800
 one of the most popular trees in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.189
 our gardens first thing you need 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.250
 decide this is the timing of the summer vaccinations 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.900
 as a rule, this is the interval of mid- July 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 to mid-August 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 the fact is that at this time already completely 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 axillary buds ripen on cuttings 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 but in fact the cutting is already ripe growth 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.189
 already almost finished with this correspondent 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
 on the tree 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.049
 quite easy to exfoliate although necessary 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 understand that in every region these 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.119
 terms will be different therefore reference 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.409
 horticultural literature always write 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.060
 so two or three weeks before the onset 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 average daily temperature plus 15 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.770
 degrees you know when you have in the area 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.380
 the average daily temperature 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 plus 15 degrees count two or three 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 weeks respectively during this period 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.220
 can do summer okulirovka as 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.049
 determine what let's say the branch is ready for 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.799
 what to choose from her eyes and for 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.869
 budding 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.810
 very easy on her decreases 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.399
 quietly between the node here these 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.140
 distance between leaves 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.259
 and if you make an incision trough she 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 easy enough to separate from the wood 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.830
 cuttings cuttings for 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 future eyes is best done 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.470
 or in the morning before 10 am or vice versa 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.060
 evening after 6 pm and desirable 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.400
 of course cloudy weather but in no way 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.950
 If the case is not in the rain, choose these 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.720
 cuttings that grow from the south well 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.790
 the lighted side here me quite 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.790
 arranges this cutting, we cut it 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.400
 now here's a cut stalk we 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.080
 must remove all leaf blades but 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.080
 leave here these stalks 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.250
 eyes best to take from the central 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.260
 parts of our cutting take very sharp 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.720
 I have a garden stationery knife 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 use start cutting about 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.230
 one and a half two centimeters higher than yours 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.590
 kidney and lead parallel cut 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.680
 just without affecting the wood like this 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.680
 here 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.150
 that's about what you should get 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.720
 and preferably the lower part 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.510
 peephole 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.819
 there was less than the top then he 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.319
 better get accustomed of course always stands 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.420
 err and make a few 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.580
 such eyes because especially if 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.870
 you are not experienced here, not everyone can 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.659
 get accustomed immediately the next step on the tree 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.840
 where are we going to plant these our eyes 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.209
 we have to make a t-shaped cut like 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:51.090
 it is done first vertically 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.090
 parallel and then across 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.609
 now gently move aside the bark 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.299
 we cut we cut only to ore 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:05.379
 wood here you see well exfoliate 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:08.109
 well now here in this place we must 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.760
 insert our peephole take our peephole and 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:19.209
 neatly insert into it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:20.950
 space and squeeze well here 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.300
 this tail that sticks out below we 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.300
 must be carefully cut off 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.199
 here is our vaccination ready but now here 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.630
 these are all places so that she doesn't 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.139
 dried out and how it should be kept 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.040
 to wind 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.500
 for this you can use 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.020
 cellophane film cut package narrow 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.120
 strip some laborious you can buy 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.000
 special garden store but gardener 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.760
 often use the usual for tape but 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.620
 it is very important to wrap non-sticky to 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.780
 trunk, he is here enough all the same 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.460
 aggressive downside she will 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.610
 nice to hold on 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.760
 absolutely not spoil your plants here 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.270
 so in a spiral with a slight stretch 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.680
 to hold tight you are wrapping 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.979
 layers of course must overlap each 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.979
 friend so come to our 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.040
 grafted eye 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:23.010
 go around it and do the next loop 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:25.889
 already above the grafted eye after 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.000
 you completely wrapped one way you 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:35.639
 must change direction for 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.680
 This is of course better to cut and start. 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.460
 reverse winding 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.930
 side just bypassing our graft 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.139
 peephole 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.990
 First the tape fits on one and then 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.780
 already passes under it like this 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:57.000
 us clearly and well fixed 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:00.599
 our grafted peephole will be all 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.130
 the vaccination is done but it 's not the whole thing 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.770
 in that this year 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.139
 summer vaccination will not grow it 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.180
 will move in growth only next spring 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.250
 but nevertheless after two or three weeks 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.630
 you will understand it got caught with you or not 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.700
 how to define it 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.729
 we left this tail on purpose 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.470
 But if this tail in two or three 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.410
 weeks you touch it attacked 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.660
 your vaccine caught on if he 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.940
 turned black and remains continues 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.430
 staying here on the trunk is more likely 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.160
 of all you did something wrong and you this 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.389
 need to repeat if you do not have time yet 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.400
 scary you still have 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.320
 autumn for vaccination that's good 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.780
 summer 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.640
 radishes and how to care for such a vaccine 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.320
 often asked in principle of care 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.480
 no particular is unique if you 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.910
 done and from the south side of your tree 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.950
 it is desirable for these two three weeks 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.410
 closest in some way 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.250
 so that the sun's rays do not bake here 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.030
 constantly 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.400
 Well, when she already rises in height on 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.620
 next year here is this part of the branch where 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.690
 you and graft worth cutting but 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.590
 do not cut directly over in 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.570
 graft and 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.090
 leaving such a penny peculiar for 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.700
 what when the twig goes to growth 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.740
 she can easily break off but the bird on 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.420
 a strong wind will blow him down therefore 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.730
 this twig can be to this bauble 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.220
 bind and lock and the first year 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.260
 the first two years she will serve as 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.840
 additional supports later you can 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.940
 delete there by dale and so today he 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.640
 talked about how to make a summer 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.770
 inoculate their way budding here 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.900
 I did the first vaccinations that way 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.330
 so I will repeat it even 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.080
 novice gardeners well, I'm with you on 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.420
 this say goodbye
