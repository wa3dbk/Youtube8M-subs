00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.080
 that is to say 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.600
 to this character because he was looking for something 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.130
 different to the anime 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.130
 because what is the video game 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.200
 actually very interesting 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 the attractiveness of the person 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.300
 I like climbing 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:04.410
 you are right 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.070
 of the child to be able to mention that I also 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.150
 I felt in the bathrooms but a lot 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.150
 the character 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 Y 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.540
 some something that you remember 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.250
 and remember as well as a fall 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.229
 some bad experience that has 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.890
 touched with people because also 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.890
 it's complicated 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.670
 good but it always exists 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.670
 Well, here in Chaco 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 Clear 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960
 efe 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.950
 says that they do not change it from person who 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.950
 orient 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.790
 why 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.720
 like the green 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.130
 as a blow 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.130
 to the truth 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.290
 something that always 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.060
 food character 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.510
 of evangelion called ryan to enjoy 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.510
 already white 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.370
 staff all the law that interesting 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.910
 I was a collaborator of a friend of mine 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.380
 that feels 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.240
 and then more black when there is a 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.970
 movie again 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.600
 then we wait for you more rope and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.230
 because what he tells me 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.230
 my partner 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.770
 a curiosity 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:07.520
 this mister monkey of the same 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.520
 and it's not that I want 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.890
 a character 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.890
 and know where to use it 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.080
 I think it is 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 Y 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.389
