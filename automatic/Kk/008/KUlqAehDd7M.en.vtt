00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.860 

it<00:02:15.609> looks<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:15.939> the<00:02:16.090> tow<00:02:16.269> truck<00:02:16.540> might<00:02:16.719> be

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
it looks like the tow truck might be

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:26.940 
it looks like the tow truck might be
moving<00:02:17.200> backwards<00:02:24.329> remember<00:02:25.329> no<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.349> anchored

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
moving backwards remember no we anchored

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.129 
moving backwards remember no we anchored
the<00:02:27.159> front<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.909> Xtreme<00:02:28.329> off<00:02:28.540> road<00:02:28.780> record

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
the front of the Xtreme off road record

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:37.349 
the front of the Xtreme off road record
I<00:02:33.299> can't<00:02:34.299> see<00:02:34.569> him<00:02:34.719> from<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.049> angle<00:02:36.359> he

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
I can't see him from this angle he

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.899 
I can't see him from this angle he
noticed<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.049> lift<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> front<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.730> the

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
noticed the lift of the front of the

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.740 
noticed the lift of the front of the
extreme<00:02:40.450> off-road<00:02:40.719> wrecker<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.540> of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
extreme off-road wrecker now think of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.509 
extreme off-road wrecker now think of
how<00:02:43.810> hard<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.650> would<00:02:44.799> have<00:02:44.919> had<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.280> hit<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
how hard we would have had to hit the

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:53.369 
how hard we would have had to hit the
end<00:02:45.849> of<00:02:45.969> that<00:02:46.150> strap<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:50.159> that<00:02:51.840> was<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.230> to

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
end of that strap and that was just to

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.599 
end of that strap and that was just to
get<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.680> moving<00:02:54.389> now<00:02:55.769> we're<00:02:56.769> dragging<00:02:57.310> half

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
get it moving now we're dragging half

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:09.070 
get it moving now we're dragging half
the<00:02:57.849> swamp<00:02:58.209> with<00:02:58.540> front<00:02:59.049> of<00:02:59.169> it<00:02:59.319> too

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:18.700 

not<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.350> mention<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:14.400> front<00:03:14.670> tire<00:03:14.880> flat<00:03:16.580> flat

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
not to mention that front tire flat flat

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:27.160 
not to mention that front tire flat flat
not<00:03:19.710> one<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.910> two<00:03:21.180> flat<00:03:21.690> tires<00:03:25.460> and<00:03:26.460> just

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
not one but two flat tires and just

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.960 
not one but two flat tires and just
think<00:03:28.170> with<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> traction<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.250> had<00:03:29.550> with<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
think with the traction I had with the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.500 
think with the traction I had with the
suburban<00:03:30.630> with<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> front<00:03:31.350> pull<00:03:31.650> vehicle<00:03:32.510> it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
suburban with a front pull vehicle it

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.660 
suburban with a front pull vehicle it
would<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.990> took<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> lot<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.590> than<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.190> two

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
would have took a lot more than just two

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.350 
would have took a lot more than just two
trucks<00:03:36.090> maybe<00:03:36.900> even<00:03:37.320> three<00:03:37.710> or<00:03:37.950> four<00:03:38.460> yeah

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
trucks maybe even three or four yeah

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.970 
trucks maybe even three or four yeah
right<00:03:39.570> there<00:03:39.720> right<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:41.960> probably<00:03:42.960> what<00:03:43.830> do

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
right there right there probably what do

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.250 
right there right there probably what do
you<00:03:44.070> guys<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.880> would<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.150> took<00:03:45.390> if<00:03:45.690> we

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you guys think it would it took if we

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.890 
you guys think it would it took if we
didn't<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:47.280> extreme<00:03:47.760> off-road<00:03:48.000> record

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
didn't have the extreme off-road record

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.140 
didn't have the extreme off-road record
any<00:03:49.440> words<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.740> wisdom<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:53.310> don't<00:03:53.460> know<00:03:53.640> I

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.210 

think<00:03:57.150> he's<00:03:57.300> gonna<00:03:57.510> need<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.810> little<00:03:58.220> working

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
think he's gonna need a little working

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.800 
think he's gonna need a little working
the<00:03:59.550> front<00:03:59.940> bumper<00:04:00.180> now<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:03.180> bumper<00:04:03.660> was

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the front bumper now that bumper was

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.920 
the front bumper now that bumper was
nice<00:04:04.080> for<00:04:04.440> show<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.610> step<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:06.570> would<00:04:06.780> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
nice for show in a step but would it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.250 
nice for show in a step but would it
held<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> strap<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.990> happens<00:04:09.990> when<00:04:10.140> you

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
held up to a strap so happens when you

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.520 
held up to a strap so happens when you
only<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.680> two<00:04:10.950> bolts<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.730> slotted<00:04:12.360> holes
