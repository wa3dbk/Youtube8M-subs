00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 for your family until July 8 that 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 have to come back tell me I find 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.680
 with professor flavio robatto is one of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 the members of the outgoing coaching staff 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.300
 from barcelona flavio I imagine 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.360
 feelings found after a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.760
 stage that although it ends with 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 sensations a bit difficult to handle 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.779
 ends up being the second best in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 last 15 years after gustavo's 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 coasts welcome good many thanks 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 yes sometimes it is ambiguous to think that in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 the last 15 years because the second 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.600
 better performance and good and you can not 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 you can not continue but happy 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.739
 because the contract was fulfilled that is not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 little 'in this institution and happy 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.950
 because in this year things have been achieved 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.870
 that in the retina of the fan will remain 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.629
 like three classics won how to win 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 a stage after being 10 points 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.440
 then they are questions that good 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.149
 that one keeps and that is that for the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.219
 future Barcelona line can 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 assess you take some time already 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.809
 the club you were at when the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 sevilla in 2013 yes yes that means 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.850
 have today the Spanish almost like in that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 moment to have sevilla 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.100
 really that out there people do not take 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 the magnitude but it's an incredible party 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 Espanyol is a team that recently 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.009
 semi final game of the king who 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 he was until the last days fighting 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 for a position uefa that has 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.159
 very good level players play is of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 selection and good that it comes adorns in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 these 90 years this is very good and very 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 with cute enjoy it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.190
 from now on the players go to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 have to dock with many other things 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.810
 a new work methodology 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 emotionally how the rubén era ends 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.850
 Israeli the era of all this body 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.310
 technical in the players' roster good 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.409
 I can not answer for it you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.000
 I answer for the coaching staff 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 a part at least that is us 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 very grateful to the players they 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.750
 they offered until the last we have not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.159
 could this perhaps achieve the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.250
 performance that was achieved in the tournament 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 gone through six factors because at 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.179
 better came several players who did not 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 they had the necessary time but 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.110
 we our feeling is of 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179
 thank you very grateful with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.819
 all the players this we just had 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.099
 a very emotional talk and before 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.469
 to leave the field and the truth that 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.659
 you keep that in your career 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.549
 as as something very special today they play 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.319
 against a team that eliminated the current 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.359
 champion of the europe league cup 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.609
 of the king is not little and how they have 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.439
 prepared even though obviously already 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.120
 the moment is a little tense by the end 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.459
 of the cycle as they have been prepared by this 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 good match yes as you said a great 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.209
 team this we prepare ourselves with 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.799
 the seriousness of the case this is a cup 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.719
 international this is something that is going to 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.669
 be left to the players possibility of 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.379
 that we see in many countries 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.090
 we have looked we have not had so much 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.090
 time to train it but to watch it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.549
 quite to Spanish and try to leave him 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.379
 to the players an idea of how they 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.889
 moves European football is very different 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.409
 to football 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.239
 South American has another dynamic this 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.709
 out there they let them play more they're going to 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.689
 let play more but in turn 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.000
 they will also attack us more they have a 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.560
 dynamic difficult to sustain if we 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.419
 we managed to take the ball away 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.919
 we probably have a lot of chance and if 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.900
 we give the ball to them play 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.310
 usually with almost four strikers 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.349
 the two players who play for the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 bands are shipowners or are half-punch 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.609
 they play with two tips as garcia as 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.640
 caisse two midfield players who 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.770
 they come off 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.380
 javi lopez but is in the bank but 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.660
 it's safe sevilla you're ruiz that 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.130
 they are players who usually do 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.780
 that the team arrives with 5 or 6 players 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.490
 the opposite field is a very good team 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.200
 and a very good test for Barcelona 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.660
 that comes from now on to 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.060
 all your technical body good in the case 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.880
 mine this rest because they are four 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.050
 years already in the club very grateful to the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.390
 club to make unforgettable moments 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.080
 but good in that success I think it's a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.750
 time to rest and good and the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.060
 possibility to continue with rubén is 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.770
 something that he offered me and that I am 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.470
 evaluating and it's an honor for me that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.970
 he keeps me in mind I do not know if the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.190
 I can ask him for alignment of 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.590
 barcelona and with pleasure Barcelona 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.170

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.989
