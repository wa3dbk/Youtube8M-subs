00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.890
 during the day to be a tough guy to times 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.170
 dig right in the dirt 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.230
 but in the evening it still looks like one 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.350
 gentleman in pinstripe suit 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.610
 allow 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.610
 the range rover sport 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.870
 the sport connects the cabinet wall 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.300
 Power of the big council rover with the 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.080
 cool new styling of the smaller evoc 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.750
 that looks really great that it 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.700
 under the four meters 85 long 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 cave then also gives a lot of space 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.559
 that goes without saying 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.800
 Incidentally, there are also seven optional 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.110
 seats in the fund and also front there 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.270
 all of a luxury in abundance 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 Everything is worked out the finest here 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 that's how it should be in this class 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.400
 Of course there is the train again 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 response system and of course full 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.680
 digital instruments and many others 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.550
 pretty displays but unfortunately no new ones 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.550
 navigator 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.260
 clear name sport for a 22 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.240
 Zoeller first a little ridiculous 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.710
 but and that's exactly the point 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 actually and not bad 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 thanks to the aluminum body 420 lighter 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.760
 is the sport really very nimble 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.369
 on the road and takes curves amazing 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.770
 dynamic domain remains 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.010
 Of course, the highly comfortable glide 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.800
 we think the ideal drive is there 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.800
 big v6 diesel with 202 90 hp 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.320
 because deeper 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 needs over the v8 compressor can 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.290
 as a range rover sport owner 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.940
 good need 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.310
 after all, you just have one 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.150
 at least 79 1000 francs for it 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.950
 output 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.790
 Of course, without all the many 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.020
 expensive extras a lock you have to 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 just can afford
