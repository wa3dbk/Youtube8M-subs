00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.500
 as children we loved dolls and 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.090
 we took everywhere great 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 we have simply forgotten them 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.930
 little but we can not deny that we 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 I love why this time the makeup 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 is inspired by dolls here between 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.050
 we discount that some I have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.749
 like a little scary but this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.259
 disguise I love it because I think 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.690
 sweet super cute female and perfect 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.860
 for soap very easy to make 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.860
 let's start from scratch 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.000
 Y 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.760
 I'm going to start by applying the base cover 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.220
 matt in secret light all over my face 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.770
 when I say the whole face includes 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.629
 Eyelids lips all over my face I go 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.180
 would match very well all the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.370
 imperfections then with the powders 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 urbanistic in two fingers that to me 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.080
 they are a little bit darker 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.229
 I will outline my face to make it 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.180
 cutest more feminine more delicate 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.490
 because I have some very factions 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.560
 strong and very marked also I will 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.619
 serve to spread disguise a little 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 my nose is a little wide so the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.320
 supported profiling a bit with these 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 powders putting them on the sides and in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.300
 the tip and this will make my 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.070
 no one looks more up 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.830
 i 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.630
 and then I'm going to nuance my face with the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.630
 Checkmate dust in my lecture 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.409
 now I'm going to define my eyebrows very well and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.260
 for that I'm going to use the quartet of 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.170
 shadows art box in boe mic this color 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.180
 brown cited is going to serve me to delineate 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 very well my eyebrows and so is the way 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 as I make them up 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 no no 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.190
 to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 with the same color but this time with a 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.010
 brush a little more chubby I'm going to mark 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.229
 the depth of my eyes and in this 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.200
 occasion I will mark the very well of a 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.150
 end at the other end of my eyes this 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 is going to make them look much bigger 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.660
 with the duo mix eyeliner in black mix 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.000
 white of the white side can delineate 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.330
 under the lower lashes and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.269
 also inside the eyes this what 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.580
 what he's going to do to us is the illusion that 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.700
 our eyes continue and that's how they look 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.440
 much bigger as the doll 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.390
 depending on the size of the line is the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.459
 size of your eyes will be 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.860
 big wrist so you guys 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.110
 they decide with the brush that we use to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 do the depth of the eyes let's 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.120
 pass it under the white line this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.150
 will give the illusion that they are natural 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.239
 our eyes this big and now 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.730
 with the twist eyeliner in black 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.829
 abstraction let's mark a line 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.349
 above the upper lashes but 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.110
 emphasizing the line in the corner 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.819
 external of the eye a little thicker 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.209
 that's going to give 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.450
 the most populated eyelashes sensation 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.269
 thicker and we're also going to make a 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.249
 line where the line of the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.579
 redundancy that if you go with the color 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:29.400
 This is going to make the illusion that 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.030
 so far our eyes end now 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.290
 with him now with the shadow duo his 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.129
 ford eyes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.620
 let's take this color rosita and what 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.980
 let's apply on the rest of the eyelid 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.659
 telling you no color and now we're going to 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.419
 make our eyes look more than 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:51.180
 doll emphasizing a lot on the eyelashes 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:54.389
 of some super charged lashes 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.600
 separated so it does not seem to choose this 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.880
 stretched mask without doubt 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.550
 and then on my cheek I'm going to put the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.620
 ciccacci in pink is and this time I'm going to 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.020
 mark it quite in the center of the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.510
 cheeks and trying to give it a way 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.510
 circular as well as public 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.580
 try to make it pinker than it is 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.950
 it usually stays on your cheeks 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.520
 but neither happens to you that it will seem 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.940
 a fallon cited with the color pigment 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.010
 intense in white russian let's 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.580
 illuminate the lacrimal and this time what 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.340
 I will do more than usual 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.490
 much more exaggerated to give you more 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.030
 size 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.940
 light to the sixth eyes that remain and 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.889
 I will also use this pigment to 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.580
 illuminate the upper part of the cheeks 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.580
 the partition and also a bit the marabina 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.990
 it's okay 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.479
 Now let's make some lips 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 doll I will put a little more base 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.419
 to cover a little the natural line of 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.570
 my lips that will not really be and with 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.300
 the color code in more barry that is a 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.880
 Fuchsia super cute color I will make 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.030
 as to try to make a heart in the 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.520
 half of my lips but this heart does not 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.650
 has to have a tip has to 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 also preserve the natural way of 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.720
 the lips at least in the part of 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.130
 below and that the part of the heart is more 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.900
 accented on the top 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.820
 if you want corrected with a little bit of base 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.030
 so that it is more 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.580
 now we just need to put an accessory that 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.550
 it can be a bun or keys in two 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.760
 two braids tail something that indicates that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.970
 you are a doll and that of course you 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.790
 help to complement this look for 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.770
 more tender and romantic this is a look 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.360
 perfect for a costume party 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.120
 now that the time of 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.820
 halloween also very fast and easy 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.280
 do they saw how nice I hope that 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.130
 you liked it if you want to use it in a 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.010
 normal day or on a normal night can 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.080
 minimize the colors a little 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.210
 and all that and makeup the mouth for 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.670
 supposedly a little more normal between 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.070
 quotes and also achieve such eyes 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.610
 great dolls without having to do 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.840
 a disguise I send you a kiss dolls 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.840
 beautiful chau
