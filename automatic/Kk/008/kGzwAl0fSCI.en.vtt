00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
coverage foundation but today I just

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.530 
coverage foundation but today I just
can't<00:05:34.570> be<00:05:34.630> bothered<00:05:34.800> anyway<00:05:35.800> I'm<00:05:36.040> rambling<00:05:36.540> so

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
can't be bothered anyway I'm rambling so

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.140 
can't be bothered anyway I'm rambling so
I<00:05:38.050> would<00:05:38.590> say<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:38.980> is<00:05:39.040> good<00:05:39.430> for<00:05:39.460> pretty<00:05:40.090> much

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
I would say this is good for pretty much

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.200 
I would say this is good for pretty much
all<00:05:40.510> skin<00:05:40.870> types<00:05:41.050> if<00:05:41.380> you're<00:05:41.590> overly<00:05:42.490> oily<00:05:42.730> i

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
all skin types if you're overly oily i

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.180 
all skin types if you're overly oily i
would<00:05:43.510> say<00:05:43.840> stay<00:05:44.320> away<00:05:44.590> from<00:05:44.650> this<00:05:44.920> only

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
would say stay away from this only

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.250 
would say stay away from this only
because<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:46.090> has<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.360> really<00:05:46.690> really<00:05:46.900> dewy

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
because it has a really really dewy

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.110 
because it has a really really dewy
finish<00:05:47.500> but<00:05:47.890> it's<00:05:48.040> not<00:05:48.250> oily<00:05:48.520> because<00:05:48.970> its

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
finish but it's not oily because its

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.310 
finish but it's not oily because its
water<00:05:49.300> based<00:05:49.480> so<00:05:49.960> there's<00:05:50.200> no<00:05:50.550> oil<00:05:52.290> if<00:05:53.290> that

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
water based so there's no oil if that

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.560 
water based so there's no oil if that
makes<00:05:53.620> sense<00:05:53.770> but<00:05:54.760> yeah<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.060> really<00:05:55.240> really

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
makes sense but yeah it's really really

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.380 
makes sense but yeah it's really really
Julie<00:05:55.930> but<00:05:56.170> once<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.800> set<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.280> with<00:05:57.400> powder<00:05:57.460> it's

in in three if you're wondering it is a

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.800 
in in three if you're wondering it is a
little<00:07:13.320> bit<00:07:13.500> dark<00:07:13.830> for<00:07:13.980> me<00:07:14.130> but<00:07:14.430> because<00:07:14.810> it's

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
little bit dark for me but because it's

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.610
