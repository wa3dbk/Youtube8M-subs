00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.860
 hi it's fred baird 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.599
 I promised you a very video 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.450
 quickly here it is 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.240
 and there for once I can tell you that 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.930
 it's very heavy 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.419
 so it's true that it's never 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.860
 nice to have cashed attacks 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.220
 on its base 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.439
 but when it's a personality of 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.290
 clash of clan like sonic and dave who 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.350
 attack you 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.239
 is that satisfaction then sneaky 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.820
 dave who does not know this is they 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.730
 dave sneaky dave it's probably one 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.500
 some of the best known players 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.050
 world clash of clan it's a farmer 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.220
 and he holds several records at 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.320
 level of play and in particular that of 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.620
 player with the level of experience the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.750
 higher clash of clan you can 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.340
 watch it's a level 222 so it's 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.270
 a player who belongs to the clan in the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.880
 dark in the dark it's the clan 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.289
 of the most famous farming in the world I 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 you review very quickly the 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:24.460
 clan you will see a little level 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.560
 this is very very heavy so 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.549
 here I have had we will say this chance 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 the chance to have this liquid f which has 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:40.119
 attacked my base and so I propose you 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 in this video the replay of the fight on 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.100
 will be watching together right now 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.459
 so that's just they drift 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.890
 attack with enough training 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.890
 traditional balloons and two cute 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.920
 many millions unfortunately I 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.590
 think it was a little bit 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.590
 ambitious on his attack 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.760
 when dad we can not really say that 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.760
 the attacker was mistreated I think he has 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.860
 just a little bit underestimated the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.860
 tesla and arches x 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.750
 here 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.989
 so I must confess that I am 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:54.290
 rather satisfied with the result of the fight 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:56.819
 that's 38% 00 trophy 17 trophies lost 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.670
 it's not bad it's not bad anyway 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.510
 and that's it but I did not want to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.349
 stop there because by attacking me there 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.780
 will still offer the possibility 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.959
 a revenge and I told myself that it 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.549
 would not be bad it would be 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.840
 still a lot of attacked his base 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.819
 so I put a lot of time because 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 that unfortunately he is often in 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.359
 line and it's very difficult to arrive 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.549
 except year either online or under 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.459
 shield of protection so that was 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.859
 very difficult for me to 2 get to 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.220
 catch an attack 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.049
 I ended up getting there here is the replay 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.489
 right away and I told myself that 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.819
 I was going to attack him must also with 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.359
 cute balloon but with my technique of 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.359
 ball online 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:49.430
 so here I already deployed mondragon I 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:51.090
 swayed but balloon and we went away 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.620
 obviously use the spells of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.020
 healing and I used the fate of rage 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.340
 to propel the ball center of the 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.460
 base a little bit faster because 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.580
 I saw that with cesar kicks level 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:12.830
 max I was going to have a hard time penetrating the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.830
 base then we are at 35% 37 38 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:21.900
 the age of v and already the age of v and in 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.640
 outside it has already been destroyed that's it 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.060
 just passed the 50% mark this is 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:33.630
 the two stars 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.130
 not bad not bad in addition to a good little one 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.510
 good little looting in elixir he had 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.280
 unfortunately not a lot of gold but 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.530
 it was not really the idea of ​​this 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.000
 this revenge 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.060
 that's 64% 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.800
 thank you sneaky dave it's 2-0 for voice 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.070
 so that's what it was 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.480
 I wanted to share with you I hope 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.980
 have the opportunity to share more 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.650
 regularly other fights with 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.020
 like that we're going to say personalities 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 of the game and maybe that's what 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.120
 will happen when I have the opportunity to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.790
 go back soon in champion but 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.030
 so that's a nice little video 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.930
 I hope you have enjoyed going there 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.930
 will have many other things that happen 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.050
 so we will find ourselves very quickly 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.710
 and by then as usual, wear 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.280
 well 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.280
 ciao
