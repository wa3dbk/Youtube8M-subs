and the other vehicles in the segment
technologies<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.350> I'd

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
technologies like what the first one I'd

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
technologies like what the first one I'd
mention<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.010> lincoln<00:00:56.760> drive<00:00:57.000> control<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
mention is lincoln drive control what is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.720 
mention is lincoln drive control what is
it<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.699> automatic<00:01:00.180> system<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
it it's an automatic system that

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
it it's an automatic system that
orchestrates<00:01:02.730> three<00:01:03.329> other<00:01:03.570> technologies<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
orchestrates three other technologies to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.520 
orchestrates three other technologies to
harmoniously<00:01:05.070> work<00:01:05.700> together<00:01:06.530> those

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
harmoniously work together those

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
harmoniously work together those
technologies<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
technologies have to do with the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
technologies have to do with the
suspension<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.439> steering<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
suspension the steering and the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
suspension the steering and the
quietness<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.930> interior<00:01:13.320> cabin<00:01:14.540> let's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
quietness of the interior cabin let's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.890 
quietness of the interior cabin let's
focus<00:01:16.020> first<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.180> quiet<00:01:18.630> we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
focus first on a and see how quiet we

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
focus first on a and see how quiet we
can<00:01:18.930> make<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> active<00:01:20.369> noise<00:01:20.700> control<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
can make it active noise control is a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
can make it active noise control is a
set<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> speakers<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.830> microphones<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.580> we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
set of speakers and microphones what we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.109 
set of speakers and microphones what we
do<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.570> cancel<00:01:28.380> unwanted<00:01:29.369> engine<00:01:29.939> noise

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
do is we cancel unwanted engine noise

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
do is we cancel unwanted engine noise
and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:31.200> create<00:01:31.880> wanted<00:01:32.880> engine<00:01:33.780> sound<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and we create wanted engine sound like

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.940 
and we create wanted engine sound like
eggs<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.890> exhaust<00:01:35.610> sound<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> combination<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
eggs or exhaust sound the combination of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550 
eggs or exhaust sound the combination of
both<00:01:38.220> give<00:01:38.610> us<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> quiet<00:01:39.150> vehicle<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.409> with

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
both give us a quiet vehicle but with

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
both give us a quiet vehicle but with
that<00:01:40.710> roar<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> engine<00:01:41.820> roar<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.470> when

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that roar the engine roar we want when

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
that roar the engine roar we want when
we<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.979> hear<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:45.079> lincoln<00:01:46.079> drive<00:01:46.290> control

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
we want to hear it lincoln drive control
