and<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:18.669> got<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:18.940> little<00:03:19.120> thing<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.329> can

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
and you got this little thing that can

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.050 
and you got this little thing that can
rotate<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.290> down<00:03:20.979> which<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.699> take<00:03:21.909> off

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
rotate in and down which can take off

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.809 
rotate in and down which can take off
his<00:03:22.180> head<00:03:22.449> other<00:03:23.169> arms<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.919> legs<00:03:24.129> to<00:03:24.489> hold<00:03:24.699> on

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
loose pieces right there which is really

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.250

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.710 
what I think it would have made it a
little<00:05:18.340> more<00:05:18.490> worth<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.849> is<00:05:18.970> if<00:05:19.120> they<00:05:19.270> included

little more worth it is if they included

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.050 
little more worth it is if they included
one<00:05:19.870> more<00:05:20.050> Spartan<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:21.250> know<00:05:21.370> not<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:21.669> new<00:05:21.880> mole

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
one more Spartan you know not a new mole

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.969 
one more Spartan you know not a new mole
just<00:05:22.419> maybe<00:05:22.599> like<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.840> red<00:05:23.139> sport<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.620> soldier

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
just maybe like a red sport and soldier

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.249 
just maybe like a red sport and soldier
that<00:05:24.099> would<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.310> been<00:05:24.370> really<00:05:24.430> cool<00:05:25.259> because

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
that would have been really cool because

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.480 
that would have been really cool because
a<00:05:26.349> new<00:05:26.530> mold<00:05:26.710> would<00:05:26.860> have<00:05:26.949> been<00:05:27.039> asking<00:05:27.310> for

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
a new mold would have been asking for

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.279 
a new mold would have been asking for
too<00:05:27.580> much<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:28.000> just<00:05:28.389> think<00:05:28.479> another<00:05:28.720> Spartan<00:05:29.169> or

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
too much I just think another Spartan or

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.990 
too much I just think another Spartan or
just<00:05:29.470> another<00:05:29.680> marine<00:05:30.190> like<00:05:30.580> figure<00:05:30.880> would

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
just another marine like figure would

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.279 
just another marine like figure would
have<00:05:31.090> made<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.300> set<00:05:31.539> a<00:05:31.720> little<00:05:31.990> more<00:05:32.110> worth

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
have made this set a little more worth

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.260 
have made this set a little more worth
it<00:05:32.500> other<00:05:33.160> than<00:05:33.310> that<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.639> just<00:05:33.789> really<00:05:34.000> cool

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
it other than that it's just really cool

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.029
