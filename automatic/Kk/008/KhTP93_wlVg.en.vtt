now<00:00:03.899> I'm<00:00:04.109> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> show<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.729> install

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
now I'm going to show you how I install

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.660 
now I'm going to show you how I install
my<00:00:06.330> fuselage<00:00:07.019> my<00:00:07.319> plane<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:09.000> use<00:00:09.270> both

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
my fuselage my plane so I can use both

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.689 
my fuselage my plane so I can use both
250<00:00:11.670> milliamps<00:00:11.940> battery<00:00:12.920> that<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.129> it's<00:00:14.340> one

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
250 milliamps battery that way it's one

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
250 milliamps battery that way it's one
that<00:00:15.360> weights<00:00:16.010> 24<00:00:17.010> grams<00:00:17.779> while<00:00:18.779> putting<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that weights 24 grams while putting the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.929 
that weights 24 grams while putting the
battery<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.669> the<00:00:20.820> nose<00:00:21.029> over<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> CG<00:00:23.669> is

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
battery in the nose over here the CG is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.120 
battery in the nose over here the CG is
80<00:00:24.900> millimeters<00:00:25.679> from<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> leading<00:00:27.089> edge<00:00:27.329> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
80 millimeters from the leading edge and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.550 
80 millimeters from the leading edge and
I<00:00:29.130> managed<00:00:29.669> with<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.179> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> fuselage<00:00:31.079> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I managed with this kind of fuselage so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.790 
I managed with this kind of fuselage so
I<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.310> some<00:00:32.579> room<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.390> play<00:00:33.870> around<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
I had some room to play around with it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.120 
I had some room to play around with it
so<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> managed<00:00:36.150> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:37.560> things

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
so I managed to do two things

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.630 
so I managed to do two things
while<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.880> like<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> plane<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.370> 250<00:00:41.370> grams

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
while I like the plane to be 250 grams

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.640 
while I like the plane to be 250 grams
I'm<00:00:42.300> using<00:00:42.720> this<00:00:44.270> 250<00:00:45.270> milliamps<00:00:46.880> battery

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
I'm using this 250 milliamps battery

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.400 
I'm using this 250 milliamps battery
just<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.830> minute<00:00:50.100> you'll<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.900> just<00:00:51.900> pulling

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
just a minute you'll see just pulling

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.140 
just a minute you'll see just pulling
her<00:00:52.740> out<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:58.260> plane<00:00:58.470> weights

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
her out and this way the plane weights

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.260 
her out and this way the plane weights
about<00:01:00.150> 200<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:01.080> about<00:01:01.320> exactly<00:01:02.130> 250<00:01:03.000> grams

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
about 200 not about exactly 250 grams

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.730 
about 200 not about exactly 250 grams
and<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.470> I'll<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:05.280> him<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.170> 260<00:01:07.170> grams<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and if I'll need him to be 260 grams I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.840 
and if I'll need him to be 260 grams I
can<00:01:08.399> use<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.570> battery<00:01:10.079> that's<00:01:10.850> 400

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
can use this battery that's 400

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.330 
can use this battery that's 400
milliamps<00:01:12.350> battery<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.549> putting<00:01:15.179> her

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
milliamps battery that I'm putting her

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.539

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
over here I'm putting it over here as

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.709 
over here I'm putting it over here as
you<00:01:20.819> can<00:01:20.999> see<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:25.460> still<00:01:26.460> while<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.090> battery

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
you can see and still while the battery

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.380 
you can see and still while the battery
is<00:01:27.869> over<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.920> still<00:01:29.310> gaining<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.119> same

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
is over here I'm still gaining the same

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.849 
is over here I'm still gaining the same
80<00:01:31.280> millimeters<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.109> CG<00:01:34.109> from<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
80 millimeters of the CG from the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.309 
80 millimeters of the CG from the
leading<00:01:35.039> edge<00:01:35.539> this<00:01:36.539> way<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.229> use<00:01:37.799> both

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
leading edge this way I can use both

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.239 
leading edge this way I can use both
both<00:01:40.319> batteries<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.130> different<00:01:41.639> air<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:43.649> dead

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
both batteries in different air in dead

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.980 
both batteries in different air in dead
air<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.850> probably<00:01:45.479> used<00:01:46.700> 250<00:01:47.700> milliamps

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
air are probably used 250 milliamps

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.399 
air are probably used 250 milliamps
battery<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.609> fly<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.229> total<00:01:52.229> weight

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
battery so I can fly it on total weight

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.169 
battery so I can fly it on total weight
of<00:01:52.459> 250<00:01:53.459> grams<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:55.740> order<00:01:56.039> to<00:01:56.159> gain<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.399> time

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
of 250 grams in order to gain more time

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.949 
of 250 grams in order to gain more time
in<00:01:58.170> air<00:01:58.670> now<00:01:59.670> I'll<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:01.109> foam<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
in air now I'll put this foam this is a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.649 
in air now I'll put this foam this is a
strata<00:02:03.959> cell<00:02:04.259> foam<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.549> instead<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.359> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
strata cell foam so instead of the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.449 
strata cell foam so instead of the
battery<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.920> receiver<00:02:10.920> won't

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
battery so that so the receiver won't

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.680 
battery so that so the receiver won't
move<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.890> receiver<00:02:14.040> won't<00:02:14.640> move<00:02:14.879> within<00:02:15.269> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
move the receiver won't move within the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.880 
move the receiver won't move within the
fuselage<00:02:17.690> now<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.380> am<00:02:18.620> connecting<00:02:19.220> back<00:02:19.460> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
fuselage now I am connecting back the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.960 
fuselage now I am connecting back the
battery<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.370> we<00:02:22.510> are<00:02:23.510> good<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.960> go

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
battery and we are good to go

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.020 
battery and we are good to go
with<00:02:26.710> 250<00:02:27.760> 260<00:02:28.760> grams<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:30.580> 260<00:02:31.580> grams<00:02:31.610> now
