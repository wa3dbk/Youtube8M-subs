00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 a review on it called picasso already 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.210
 before gandhi 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.789
 game rearrange yourself survival 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 multiplayer mining will enjoy especially 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.839
 multiplayer games 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.929
 let's bring the judges to start I 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:28.220
 show i think the first location is me 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:32.720
 I think I will review 2 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.190
 how to eat my mind from 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.700
 single-player leopard is no different 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 except while as well, except that here 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.280
 for example, they will be settled in cars and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.710
 block play is no longer paid but i am deep 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.770
 us for free gaga 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.450
 the game develops well done 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 They heaving barrels you see here at 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.100
 zombie 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.659
 20th century in this game can be said to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.430
 average level players give die 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.070
 visits have land falls 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.940
 I'm on business to talk to you about 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.630
 gods these i'm shooting a game and a tablet and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:27.030
 nvidia shield does not impose this or 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 also after not updating 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 developers have added optimization because 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.450
 also good now I have not played 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.649
 lays a dachshund buy it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 and I dropped the official band 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.740
 reference will be under the description so here we are 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.350
 we shoot zombies cry so there is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.200
 inventory you can craft stuff but 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.119
 to cut things like here 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 It shows what you need 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.670
 so further we look we can take 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.979
 mail gang something like a translation 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 translated as ligation can run 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.310
 jump 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.209
 aim but i don't have a weapon 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.570
 whom 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.720
 by which you can aim so 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.660
 I have akinin baguette from the car 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.989
 for example if you land the car and you 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.260
 sticking around dofigish zombies you get out 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.160
 cars and car throws at the other end 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.510
 cities here is one of the funniest gods 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.359
 It seemed to me well, such a review 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 then I think we need to go already 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.340
 for me already see the zombies want so here 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.950
 melee ax 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.849
 already half a year another bug is not easy 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:55.450
 jumping up we can so kill zombies in 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:59.230
 lower me so much easier 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.890
 kill young don't kill 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.959
 me that we have a zombie cauldron zombie leaves 2 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.950
 class 1 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.269
 these are the simple zombies here, but others 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 these are such 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:20.980
 not like zombies black zombies well yes 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.849
 here is the road 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.239
 zombies and spawn picking it up 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.180

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.970
 I know how to fix it yet or not, but I 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:40.200
 assumed that must pass not 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.200
 will fix me 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.420
 zombies in physics describe from such 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.620

 the puck will come off 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.660
 we see how I am going to apply another 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.660
 the player can not taste the debt 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:23.010

 poured out like flying weapons because 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:27.960
 that you can get to the top straight and 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:29.700

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.590

 even when you come in like that 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.070
 for example you will not succeed well 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.280
