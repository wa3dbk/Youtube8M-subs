00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.010
 like PC players are a rather passive species quite unlike the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.770
 Console players who wave around in the air with their mobile boats are 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.619
 so that Groth and torture or hit the clock on digital guitar 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.310
 On the other hand, we leave our input tool on the table and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 Flower going on even preferred on the desk chair Urbach only 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.380
 occasionally a finger crooked or two 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.480
 Actually it's good on the other hand it's permanent 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.020
 certainly not healthy, some exercise would be good 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.490
 otherwise the bikini may look a bit ridiculously different in the summer 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.500
 out 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.960
 Does that mean you're all buying a console and EU or even us 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 do the right sport 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.220
 No, that would go too far, there is more athletic 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.770
 Input methods also for the PC 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.050
 like this one here is the USB dance mat that is for about ten euros on the internet 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.370
 gives 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.570
 This mass contains pressure sensors and so it will take Hans's steps 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.840
 which are then recognized by the PC as integrated many 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 By the way, Windows does not need drivers for this. Windows itself already does everything 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.990
 necessary with 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.899
 Well, but I do not overcharge Schacht 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.180
 embarrassing was with a rather quiet game on 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 So up to the mat and off you go 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840
 but somehow it does not work that way 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 maybe my onion is just the right game 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.020
 So it's a bit sportier, for example, here Stetten Media from that 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.800
 was programmed for this type of transports and for free on the net 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.290
 to have is 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.660
 the stage is not that nice 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.390
 keep up with who knew each other for work but no matter it comes to the game 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.120
 even on 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.600
 then we want to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.630
 the gameplay is quite simple it is similar to Gitai Rhodes for everyone 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.159
 understand 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.640
 The rhythm of the music is shown by Feiler we say in which 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 Direction to scratch 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.589
 I rehearsal that's too exhausting for me it must be another 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.749
 So give way 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.189
 and I already have an idea 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.339
 yes that's better stuff 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.709
 The sporty dance game SDW can be brother again 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.239
 The natural spectacle works without being photographed 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.559
 to strain 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.549
 the summer can come
