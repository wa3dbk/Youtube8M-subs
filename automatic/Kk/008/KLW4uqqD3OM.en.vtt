oil that's why it's downhill takes a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.189 
oil that's why it's downhill takes a
little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> each<00:00:57.899> time<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little bit of time and each time you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.029 
little bit of time and each time you
fill<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> hose<00:00:59.329> to<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:01.039> slowly

the<00:01:26.549> bubbles<00:01:26.880> work<00:01:27.479> their<00:01:27.689> way<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.140> hill<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
the bubbles work their way up hill and

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
the bubbles work their way up hill and
then<00:01:30.350> repeat<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> pressurization<00:01:31.770> process

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
then repeat the pressurization process

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.010 
then repeat the pressurization process
until<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.990> sump<00:01:34.920> stabilized<00:01:35.520> at

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
until I have the sump stabilized at

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
until I have the sump stabilized at
about<00:01:37.020> 70<00:01:37.470> psi<00:01:38.090> I've<00:01:39.090> weighed<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> unit

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
about 70 psi I've weighed the unit

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.660 
about 70 psi I've weighed the unit
before<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> after<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.220> confirm<00:01:41.520> how

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
before and after so I can confirm how

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
before and after so I can confirm how
much<00:01:41.820> oil<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.150> actually<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.570> there<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.619> with

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
much oil is actually in there and with

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.990 
much oil is actually in there and with
this<00:01:44.520> thing<00:01:44.729> charged<00:01:45.680> go<00:01:46.680> ahead<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.000> install

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this thing charged go ahead and install

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.990 
this thing charged go ahead and install
it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.320 

in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.600> back<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.570> Fox<00:01:55.900> Body<00:01:56.110> Mustang<00:01:57.330> it's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
in the back this Fox Body Mustang it's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.750 
in the back this Fox Body Mustang it's
going<00:01:58.480> to<00:01:58.540> go<00:01:58.630> right<00:01:58.780> there<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.860> need<00:02:03.610> all

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
going to go right there now I need all

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.940 
going to go right there now I need all
15<00:02:04.150> feet<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.480> that<00:02:04.600> hose<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:07.390> front

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
15 feet of that hose to get up front

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.550 
15 feet of that hose to get up front
through<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.070> firewall<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.790> then<00:02:10.720> down<00:02:11.440> in

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
through the firewall and then down in

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.070 
through the firewall and then down in
the<00:02:11.620> corner<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.190> where<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.630> tea<00:02:13.840> valve

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
the corner there's where the tea valve

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260 
the corner there's where the tea valve
will<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.400> idea<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.850> turn<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
will go so the idea is I turn the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.660 
will go so the idea is I turn the
ignition<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:17.050> for<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.350> first<00:02:17.470> time<00:02:17.670> pressure

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
ignition on for the first time pressure

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
ignition on for the first time pressure
switch<00:02:18.970> detects<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.200> system<00:02:20.560> pressures

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
switch detects that the system pressures

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.260 
switch detects that the system pressures
below<00:02:21.190> 37<00:02:22.120> psi<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:23.710> opens<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.730> Accu<00:02:25.030> sump

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
below 37 psi it opens the Accu sump

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.360 
below 37 psi it opens the Accu sump
it'll<00:02:26.200> purge<00:02:26.410> all<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.740> air<00:02:26.860> out<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.220> tube

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
it'll purge all the air out of the tube

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.590 
it'll purge all the air out of the tube
at<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.700> point<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> need<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.330> worry<00:02:28.510> about

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600
