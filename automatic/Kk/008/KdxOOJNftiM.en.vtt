00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
at this Nissan dealership but the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.850

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
pieces still safe to use but it should

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.950 
pieces still safe to use but it should
be<00:01:36.250> replaced<00:01:37.620> next<00:01:38.850> apparently<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.479> amperage

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
be replaced next apparently the amperage

be replaced next apparently the amperage
on<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:42.330> charger<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.510> limited<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.260> 30<00:01:44.619> amps

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
on this charger is limited to 30 amps

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640 
on this charger is limited to 30 amps
and<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.250> top<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.550> that<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:49.750> voltage<00:01:49.960> sake<00:01:50.440> is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
and on top of that the voltage sake is

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.820 
and on top of that the voltage sake is
so<00:01:50.830> bad<00:01:51.130> we're<00:01:51.880> down<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.180> 190<00:01:53.050> 8<00:01:53.200> volts<00:01:55.800> even<00:01:56.800> I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
so bad we're down to 190 8 volts even I

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.850 
so bad we're down to 190 8 volts even I
mean<00:01:57.450> industrial<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.750> know<00:01:58.780> business<00:01:59.619> here

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
mean industrial you know business here

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.890 
mean industrial you know business here
I'm<00:02:00.070> guessing<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.150> course<00:02:01.180> they<00:02:01.509> have<00:02:01.660> three

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
I'm guessing of course they have three

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.609 
I'm guessing of course they have three
phase<00:02:02.080> power<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.300> ideally<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.450> should<00:02:04.479> be<00:02:04.840> 108

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
phase power so ideally it should be 108

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.169 
phase power so ideally it should be 108
volts<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:08.040> mean<00:02:09.040> considering<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> whole

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

volts<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.850> kind<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.840> sad<00:02:18.510> I'd<00:02:19.510> hate<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.980> now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
vehicles now only one only me is it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
plugged in and charging at this moment

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.060 
plugged in and charging at this moment
I'd<00:02:31.600> hate<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:31.959> what<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.320> voltage<00:02:32.620> sake

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
I'd hate to see what that voltage sake

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.979 
I'd hate to see what that voltage sake
would<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.459> like<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.540> had<00:02:35.970> two<00:02:36.989> vehicles

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
would look like if they had two vehicles

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.900 
would look like if they had two vehicles
charging<00:02:41.880> even<00:02:42.880> though<00:02:43.000> even<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.360> they<00:02:43.540> have
