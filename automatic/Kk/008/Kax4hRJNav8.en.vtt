we<00:00:30.280> have<00:00:30.430> this<00:00:30.670> silt<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.180> that<00:00:31.930> creates<00:00:32.320> a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:32.499 
we have this silt that that creates a

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.829 
we have this silt that that creates a
great<00:00:32.890> environment<00:00:33.370> for<00:00:33.489> aquatic<00:00:33.999> plants<00:00:34.690> and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
great environment for aquatic plants and

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.840 
great environment for aquatic plants and
the<00:00:35.379> insects<00:00:35.769> love<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.429> so<00:00:36.550> we<00:00:36.670> have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
the insects love it and so we have

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.049 
the insects love it and so we have
hundreds<00:00:37.839> and<00:00:37.989> hundreds<00:00:38.289> of<00:00:38.350> fish<00:00:38.850> 3,000<00:00:39.850> for

hundreds and hundreds of fish 3,000 for
a<00:00:40.089> mile<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.569> think<00:00:40.809> is<00:00:40.899> what<00:00:41.050> they<00:00:41.170> measure<00:00:41.379> what

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
a mile I think is what they measure what

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.819 
a mile I think is what they measure what
a<00:00:42.339> thing<00:00:42.609> about<00:00:42.760> silver<00:00:43.239> creek<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.749> that<00:00:44.289> it's

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
a thing about silver creek is that it's

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.309 
a thing about silver creek is that it's
the<00:00:45.190> water<00:00:45.399> is<00:00:45.519> crystal<00:00:45.670> clear<00:00:46.149> and<00:00:46.960> its

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:47.319 
the water is crystal clear and its

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.799 
the water is crystal clear and its
technical<00:00:47.890> fishing<00:00:48.309> it's<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:48.909> easy<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.690> use

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
technical fishing it's that easy to use

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.899 
technical fishing it's that easy to use
they're<00:00:49.960> tough<00:00:50.170> fish<00:00:50.409> to<00:00:50.589> catch<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.100> like<00:00:51.789> I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
they're tough fish to catch and like I

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.910 
they're tough fish to catch and like I
said<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.179> insects<00:00:52.659> are<00:00:52.839> very<00:00:53.050> diverse<00:00:53.409> it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
said the insects are very diverse it's

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.529 
said the insects are very diverse it's
really<00:00:54.219> hard<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.579> match<00:00:54.789> what<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.179> fish<00:00:55.389> are

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
really hard to match what the fish are

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.649 
really hard to match what the fish are
eating<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:57.039> water<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.519> very<00:00:57.729> still<00:00:58.269> because

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
eating the water is very still because

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.829 
eating the water is very still because
it's<00:00:58.809> spring<00:00:59.229> creek<00:00:59.559> and<00:01:00.429> so<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:01.449> very

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
it's spring creek and so it's very

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's spring creek and so it's very
difficult<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.889> catch<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.609> fish<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:04.120> mean

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
difficult to catch the fish I mean

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.950 
difficult to catch the fish I mean
they're<00:01:04.420> very<00:01:04.540> smart

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
they're very smart

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.510
