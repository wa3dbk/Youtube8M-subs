00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 it was once a kingdom full 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.130
 Flowers are always the sun 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.849
 seemed and just with all this other 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.550
 good- natured kempen 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.380
 Of course it can not go on like that 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 That's why we swing into dungeons 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 two as the embodiment of the absolute 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 evil in best dungeon keeper manner 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 to feel sorry for it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 spread the good and finally the good 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.349
 to make garaus 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 the german developer studio rentfort 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.010
 but dare the dungeon keeper 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 recipe some very own note too 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 miss 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.210
 if that was such a good idea in the test 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.210
 figure it out 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.090
 in the first mission of dungeons 2 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.980
 everything still looks good for ours 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.600
 his horde is terrified 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 orks and goblins are on it 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.860
 Kings Maw the capital of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 alliance of the good to the soil of the earth too 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010
 do 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 but then something unexpected happens 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 out of nowhere dive a few heroes 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 on robbing the evil with one 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 spell his body and beat 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.130
 his army in flight 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.960
 now it is up to us the evil again 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 to make a difference and another one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.400
 set up army to take revenge 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 and the good this time really from 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 to eradicate earth soil 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.650
 this page main action links the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 ten missions of the story campaign of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.000
 dungeons 20 loose for that tell 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 each with its own small order 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.619
 let's hunt a story 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 king robert because of the passion for 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 who has hunting and likes poetry 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.119
 Let's see the magician Gandalf 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 and of course that's it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.659
 all pretty obvious 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 allusion to another fantasy universe 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.250
 that's still nice 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 the really hard-working squeaks of the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 chattering narrator go against it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.350
 pretty fast on 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.350
 five questions should know that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.049
 moment as we have our own notes for 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.759
 the dungeon keeper recipe at first 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.009
 look looks like everything back then 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.420
 original from bullfrog with the hand of 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.050
 We mark days of fright 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.099
 then gold from ours 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.569
 butterflies jerk off this humor 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.190
 be reduced 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.720
 place in the caves formed 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 we clear out like beer breweries 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.530
 training arena or workshops in which 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.510
 we our units provide you 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 train or study improvements 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.250
 this system actually works 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.709
 just as good as it was then 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.299
 because there are changes in new creatures 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.190
 For example, do not just come in this way 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.830
 our dungeon but are targeted 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.690
 heard and space we need to manually 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.250
 equip with the necessary objects 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.069
 in a hospital for example 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.900
 Let's just place single beds 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.489
 micromanagement has opposite dungeon 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.290
 Keeper significantly increased 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.900
 that would be nothing bad per se 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.880
 but the overloaded and interlaced 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.410
 menus and suboptimal operation 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.519
 sometimes make the dungeon tree too 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.320
 annoying formula 1 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.239
 if we click in the room, for example 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.100
 It often happens that we want to take place 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.250
 its one of the running creatures 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.870
 grab us as in dungeon 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.670
 Keeper only in the dungeon to crawl and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.769
 to wait for advancing heroes 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.420
 Let's go into Dungeons 2 on the offensive 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.790
 We send ours via a portal 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.739
 units to the surface and behold 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.410
 suddenly the dungeon is playing 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.609
 Keeper remake to the classic 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.870
 real time strategy game here 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.880
 we control our units 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.370
 move and move directly with the mouse 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.329
 attack commands and solve 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.579
 Special skills from all this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.290
 does not work that under the earth 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.640
 makes for a nice change of the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 sudden change between two 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.000
 completely different control 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.130
 However, variants also provide again and again 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.510
 for irritation 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.519
 The missions are varied and 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.350
 stuck full of smaller side tasks 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.510
 Here we sneak with a goblin 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.700
 unnoticed in a castle of the alliance 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.840
 and make targeted use of his ability 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.970
 to make oneself invisible 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.220
 next to the horde of absolute evil 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.709
 offers dungeons 2 with the demons yet 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.970
 a second playable party please 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.530
 do not expect too much 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.930
 playfully, both differ 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.670
 peoples only marginally more than 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.599
 The demons bring optical variety 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.599
 so not in the game 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.950
 the presentation of dungeons two 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.629
 We really like the graphics 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.239
 reminds you a bit with the comic style 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.700
 At Dota 2 offers nice details and 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.229
 soft animations and when our hordes 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.419
 an area on the surface of the 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.489
 powers of good liberated and thriving 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.350
 landscapes of death and destruction soft 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.160
 that is always nice 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.470
 to look 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.150
 The music is also absolutely in 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.090
 order and also the speaker makes 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.790
 his thing is really good just that 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.740
 what he says well but manager has to be yes 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.470
 therefore also of something live now 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.590
 a move needs a term say 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:46.800
 games by kalypso many many fly 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.150
 Thank you advertising end actually want 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.990
 we answer for your courage on the 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.610
 pat tap 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.289
 dungeon keeper not just too 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.360
 copy but many interesting 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.610
 new ideas like the trips to the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.200
 to incorporate Oberwelt deserves recognition 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.000
 Unfortunately, the transition is between 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.039
 underground dungeon construction and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.660
 aboveground real-time strategy with two 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.130
 completely different control 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.849
 but not everything 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.830
 harmoniously 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.530
 so neither of the two parts works 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.120
 really completely outgrown by the 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.310
 nice missions the indestructible 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.260
 dungeon keeper gameplay and the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.210
 successful presentation comes despite 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.070
 The service makes enough fun 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.849
 That's why you can buy a lot 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.849
 flirt 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.110
 the ultimate evil was despite the 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.660
 wet end of alliance angry as man 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.380
 is watching his delicious revenge 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.419
 but had been allowed to anticipate something 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.669
 this should come later 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.510
 I 've been browsing before and who 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.510
 that read through
