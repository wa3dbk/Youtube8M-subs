sweet<00:01:46.940> its<00:01:47.300> crystal<00:01:47.930> as<00:01:48.080> well<00:01:50.920> now<00:01:52.090> take<00:01:53.620> well

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
sweet its crystal as well now take well

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620 
sweet its crystal as well now take well
I<00:01:54.650> use<00:01:54.950> one<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.160> these<00:01:55.400> gray<00:01:55.700> because<00:01:55.880> this

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
I use one of these gray because this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.090 
I use one of these gray because this
will<00:01:56.780> rotate<00:01:57.250> much<00:01:58.300> much<00:01:59.300> smoother<00:02:00.140> so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
will rotate much much smoother so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
will rotate much much smoother so
however<00:02:01.780> put<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> here<00:02:04.660> so<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.869> see<00:02:06.170> it's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
however put it here so you see it's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.660 
however put it here so you see it's
rotate<00:02:06.800> rotate<00:02:10.900> here<00:02:11.900> are<00:02:12.080> one<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.670> and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670

I<00:02:15.459> have<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.490> 2<00:02:17.060> by<00:02:17.300> 2<00:02:17.660> by<00:02:19.270> 2<00:02:20.270> flat<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:23.030> probably

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
I have a 2 by 2 by 2 flat it's probably

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.380 
I have a 2 by 2 by 2 flat it's probably
the<00:02:23.570> best<00:02:23.900> way<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.930> know<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.709> build<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
the best way to you know you can build a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.750 
the best way to you know you can build a
regularly<00:02:29.390> two<00:02:30.110> by<00:02:30.230> two<00:02:30.310> not<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.520> be<00:02:31.610> too

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
regularly two by two not to be too

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.320 
regularly two by two not to be too
smooth

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
smooth

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.160 
smooth
but<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.410> think<00:02:34.300> everything<00:02:35.300> will<00:02:35.450> work<00:02:35.510> much

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
but I think everything will work much

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.830 
but I think everything will work much
better<00:02:36.230> with<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.160> 280<00:02:37.459> here<00:02:39.130> yep<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.150> I'm
