start to pull your first rib up and you

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.429 
start to pull your first rib up and you
got<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> nerve<00:02:16.180> bundle<00:02:16.420> coming<00:02:17.049> out<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.319> your

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
got a nerve bundle coming out of your

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.959 
got a nerve bundle coming out of your
neck<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.010> travels<00:02:18.430> us<00:02:18.519> between<00:02:18.819> your

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
neck that travels us between your

collarbone or your clavicle and your
first<00:02:21.400> rib<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.390> if<00:02:22.450> your<00:02:22.569> first<00:02:22.750> rib<00:02:23.049> is<00:02:23.200> higher

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
first rib so if your first rib is higher

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.459 
first rib so if your first rib is higher
from<00:02:24.340> tighter<00:02:24.640> scalene<00:02:25.209> muscles<00:02:25.659> this<00:02:26.260> could

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
from tighter scalene muscles this could

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.800 
from tighter scalene muscles this could
start<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.829> impinge<00:02:27.310> upon<00:02:27.639> that<00:02:28.120> nerve<00:02:28.329> bundle

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
start to impinge upon that nerve bundle

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.660 
start to impinge upon that nerve bundle
then<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.500> start<00:02:29.799> getting<00:02:29.920> pain<00:02:30.280> tingling

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
then you can start getting pain tingling

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
then you can start getting pain tingling
numbness<00:02:30.969> and<00:02:31.239> burning<00:02:31.719> all<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.409> way<00:02:32.500> down

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
numbness and burning all the way down

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.800 
numbness and burning all the way down
your<00:02:32.950> fingers<00:02:33.370> all<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.030> way<00:02:34.120> down<00:02:34.329> your<00:02:34.480> arms

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410 
your fingers all the way down your arms
so<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:36.099> good<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.340> structure<00:02:36.819> these<00:02:36.909> muscles

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
so it's good to structure these muscles

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.119 
so it's good to structure these muscles
let<00:02:37.629> me<00:02:37.719> show<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:37.989> how<00:02:38.230> you've<00:02:38.620> got<00:02:38.859> three
