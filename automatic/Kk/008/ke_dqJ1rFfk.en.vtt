00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.090
 a rare mistake pop and knife and who 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.060
 costs the goal of equalizing to his 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 team at 8 and did not ask that much

 who try to resist the people of Brest 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.730
 who insist and the penalty point of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.980
 penalty designated by sébastien will send you 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.170

 red and yet referee took this 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.920
 decision

 the penalty succeeded by eden ben passat 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 the one who seems to have been slightly 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.080
 pushed into the penalty box 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.970
