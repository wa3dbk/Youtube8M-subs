00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.630
 It is impossible in the middle of March, but at least today it is freezing cold 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.900
 Some Munich does not stop behind me Aben one makes surfing one of the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.960
 Among other things today cap on is Manuel first to the beginning as said it 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.269
 mid-March is really cold today 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.980
 how do you manage to keep that up in the water drop 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 Wooten Mio tears to for example 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.330
 in the summer it is naturally more beautiful 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.609
 But they also said that they had more going on than in winter 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.609
 still I show on the street 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.900
 most of them came very badly 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 Mouth around my old former was holding so 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.840
 I said I have always watched this and allowed me the whole 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.350
 Time 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.070
 this is absolutely necessary 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 from then one before asked the Alpine Club 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 He then told me that I can not just go his own 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.560
 can start there and then I have trouble 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.810
 in juice is desired for Christmas 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 fallen from the road 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.570
 Now you are usually here 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.200
 but will open in May at the World Championships in Perouse where 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 is there the difference between this quite small wave and the waves? 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960
 Timo heard 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.730
 so the Wengenroth cells are always different 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.100
 Develop always stays constant 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.649
 Maybe Atrix can be based here so anytime 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.380
 Annabelle gets fresh 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.070
 More and more you have to 10 which wave is good Belmondo is definitely one 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.620
 So the best is the job for his age 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.950
 one of the youngest uni-rectors back in the beautiful more Steelers 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.130
 and that's not his lyrics so Donath and parents always recommend something 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.439
 new here 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.839
 are more in the parking lot 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.079
 that means the World Cup is justified in any case 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.039
 Guardian 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.089
 It makes you want more yesterday 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.449
 an impression 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.799
 I think slower testing 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.779
 rather make a picture 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.069
 We knew in March the emergence of a letter break a school thwarted 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.229
 been 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.359
 Vintage were 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 definitely a bit too 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.739
 Smoking and sports like everyone else 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.179
 then let young boys continue their training 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.299
 Of course I wish a lot of success at the championships in Cairo 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.269
 and all good well here a Munich surfing 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.449
