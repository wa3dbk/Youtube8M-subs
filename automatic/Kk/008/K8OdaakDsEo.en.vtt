00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
world unfortunately so in my opinion is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
world unfortunately so in my opinion is
very<00:00:20.789> important<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> understand<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> body<00:00:22.020> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
very important to understand the body of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
very important to understand the body of
water<00:00:22.380> because<00:00:22.890> water<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> something<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
water because water is something that

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
when you have a higher quality water you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
when you have a higher quality water you
drinking<00:00:26.939> water<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> pure<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:28.050> fresh

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
drinking water that is pure that's fresh

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
drinking water that is pure that's fresh
that's<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.519> closest<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.359> would

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that's you know closest to what it would

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.209 
that's you know closest to what it would
be<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:31.019> nature<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> most

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
be like in nature you get the most

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
be like in nature you get the most
benefit<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> unfortunately<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.840> today's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
benefit from it unfortunately in today's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
benefit from it unfortunately in today's
modern<00:00:34.350> world<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.820> see

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
modern world we you know we see

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
modern world we you know we see
sanitized<00:00:36.899> water<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.350> add<00:00:37.530> chlorine<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.460> water

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
sanitized water we add chlorine to water

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
sanitized water we add chlorine to water
we<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.000> fluoride<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.750> water<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.680> heavy

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
we had fluoride to water there's heavy

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
we had fluoride to water there's heavy
metals<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> water<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.000> water<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
metals in the water because water is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.860 
metals in the water because water is
stored<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.410> metal<00:00:44.160> tanks<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.870> through

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
stored in metal tanks and that's through

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
stored in metal tanks and that's through
high<00:00:46.079> pressure<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.860> through<00:00:47.039> metal<00:00:47.280> pipes<00:00:47.460> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
high pressure put through metal pipes so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
high pressure put through metal pipes so
lead<00:00:48.570> mercury<00:00:48.840> aluminum<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.219> other

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
lead mercury aluminum all these other

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
lead mercury aluminum all these other
things<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> seep<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> water

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
things I can kind of seep into the water

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
things I can kind of seep into the water
and<00:00:53.370> by<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> time<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> water<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and by the time you get the water at the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.500 
and by the time you get the water at the
tap<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.500> tap<00:00:55.800> water<00:00:56.270> your<00:00:57.270> water

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
tap you know on tap water your water

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
tap you know on tap water your water
isn't<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.079> pure<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> should<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.390> really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
isn't as pure as it should be so really

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
isn't as pure as it should be so really
ideally<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> healthiest<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> spring

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
ideally the healthiest water is spring

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
ideally the healthiest water is spring
lumber<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.489> spring<00:01:02.789> water<00:01:03.000> plastic<00:01:03.510> bottles

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
plastic bottles so getting water from
spring<00:01:13.439> water<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.890> great<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.369> great<00:01:14.549> for

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
spring water is great for great for

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.730 
spring water is great for great for
outdoors<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:15.960> live<00:01:16.110> close<00:01:16.590> to

that you can forward that you know even

that will hydrate their body and give

needs<00:01:46.620> to<00:01:46.800> be<00:01:46.890> healthy<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.000> comes<00:01:48.150> to

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
needs to be healthy so when it comes to

needs to be healthy so when it comes to
acne<00:01:48.800> being<00:01:49.800> dehydrated<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.000> big<00:01:51.210> issue<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
acne being dehydrated is a big issue but

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.750 
acne being dehydrated is a big issue but
then<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.010> drinking<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.340> water<00:01:53.460> if

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
then if you start drinking more water if

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.920 
then if you start drinking more water if
you're<00:01:53.850> certainly<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.330> tap<00:01:54.570> water<00:01:54.810> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you're certainly more tap water for

you're certainly more tap water for

you're<00:01:56.460> drinking<00:01:56.670> chlorine<00:01:57.330> you're<00:01:57.900> drinking

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
you're drinking chlorine you're drinking

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.230 
you're drinking chlorine you're drinking

fluoride you're drinking heavy metals

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.750

to<00:03:17.459> avoid<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.850> just<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.239> say

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
to avoid it just to be say

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.340 
to avoid it just to be say
because<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.360> nature<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> levels<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.230> fluoride

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
because in nature the levels of fluoride

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.190 
because in nature the levels of fluoride
are<00:03:20.590> much<00:03:20.950> much<00:03:21.130> much<00:03:21.400> lower<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:22.240> son<00:03:22.840> lower

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
are much much much lower but son lower

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.020 
are much much much lower but son lower
than<00:03:23.830> what<00:03:24.010> they<00:03:24.100> added<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.880> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
than what they added to the to the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.630 
than what they added to the to the
drinking<00:03:25.720> water<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.170> by<00:03:26.500> seven<00:03:26.920> times<00:03:27.190> or<00:03:27.460> so

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
drinking water like by seven times or so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.570 
drinking water like by seven times or so
so<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.290> doesn't<00:03:29.560> make<00:03:29.650> sense<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.920> me<00:03:30.070> it's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
so it's it doesn't make sense to me it's

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.070 
so it's it doesn't make sense to me it's
better<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.760> wet<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.510> then<00:03:31.720> that's<00:03:31.810> fine<00:03:32.020> I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
better to wet it and then that's fine I

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.980 
better to wet it and then that's fine I
least<00:03:32.560> have<00:03:32.740> heavy<00:03:32.980> metals<00:03:33.070> because<00:03:33.900> water<00:03:34.900> is

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
least have heavy metals because water is

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.900 
least have heavy metals because water is
about<00:03:35.110> two<00:03:35.290> metal<00:03:35.620> pipes<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.790> have

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
about two metal pipes and then you have

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.090 
about two metal pipes and then you have
you<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.210> about<00:03:37.690> tanks<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.530> there's<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.920> lot

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
you know about tanks and there's a lot

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.830 
you know about tanks and there's a lot
of<00:03:39.190> pressure<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.120> know<00:03:40.150> metal<00:03:40.390> erodes

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
of pressure and you know metal erodes

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.720 
of pressure and you know metal erodes
over<00:03:41.020> time<00:03:41.170> especially<00:03:41.590> when<00:03:41.890> chlorine<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.580> in

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
over time especially when chlorine is in

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.520 
over time especially when chlorine is in
the<00:03:42.790> water<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.660> only<00:03:43.810> simple<00:03:44.140> things

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the water and the only simple things

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.460 
the water and the only simple things
so<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.610> metals<00:03:45.940> will<00:03:46.150> seep<00:03:46.930> into<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.290> water

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
so the metals will seep into the water

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.800 
so the metals will seep into the water
so<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:48.040> heavy<00:03:48.580> metal<00:03:48.910> toxicity<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.570> body<00:03:49.600> is

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so a heavy metal toxicity in the body is

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.010 
so a heavy metal toxicity in the body is
a<00:03:49.840> huge<00:03:50.290> issue<00:03:50.440> it's<00:03:51.430> very<00:03:52.030> very<00:03:52.540> common

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
a huge issue it's very very common

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.040 
a huge issue it's very very common
commonly<00:03:53.860> linked<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.460> hormonal<00:03:55.360> imbalances

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
commonly linked to hormonal imbalances

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.980 
commonly linked to hormonal imbalances
so<00:03:56.260> heavy<00:03:57.250> heavy<00:03:57.490> metal<00:03:57.850> toxicity<00:03:58.120> toxicity

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
so heavy heavy metal toxicity toxicity

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.940 
so heavy heavy metal toxicity toxicity
in<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.140> water<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.380> not<00:03:59.530> good

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
in the water is not good

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.290 
in the water is not good
whether<00:04:00.250> once<00:04:00.520> again<00:04:00.760> it's<00:04:00.880> coming<00:04:01.000> from<00:04:01.120> your

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
whether once again it's coming from your

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.180 
whether once again it's coming from your
shower<00:04:01.450> or<00:04:01.720> your<00:04:01.840> drinking<00:04:02.110> water<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.860> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
shower or your drinking water so I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.340 
shower or your drinking water so I
thought<00:04:03.520> something<00:04:04.050> thankfully<00:04:05.050> recently

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350

thought something thankfully recently

below this video so you can read more
about<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.800> pick<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.220> up<00:04:36.370> if<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.550> want<00:04:36.760> but

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
about it and pick it up if you want but

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.470 
about it and pick it up if you want but
basically<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:38.350> sick<00:04:39.130> it's<00:04:39.520> sixty<00:04:39.970> bucks<00:04:40.150> and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
basically it's sick it's sixty bucks and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.160 
basically it's sick it's sixty bucks and
all<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.170> do<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.620> take<00:04:42.280> this<00:04:42.490> little<00:04:43.170> this

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
all that you do is take this little this

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.080 
all that you do is take this little this
little<00:04:44.230> filter<00:04:44.770> out<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.220> then<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.490> flush<00:04:45.880> it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
little filter out and then you flush it

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
little filter out and then you flush it
with<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:47.530> thing<00:04:47.860> right<00:04:48.040> here<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:49.660> flush<00:04:49.930> it

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
with this thing right here you flush it

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.300 
with this thing right here you flush it
out<00:04:50.170> with<00:04:50.380> tap<00:04:50.590> water<00:04:50.620> for<00:04:50.920> like<00:04:51.010> three

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
out with tap water for like three

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.980 
out with tap water for like three
minutes<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.820> then<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:53.260> basically<00:04:54.870> put<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
minutes and then you basically put the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.670 
minutes and then you basically put the
water<00:04:56.200> in<00:04:56.650> here<00:04:57.640> you<00:04:57.820> put<00:04:58.780> your<00:04:58.810> tap<00:04:59.290> water<00:04:59.500> in

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
water in here you put your tap water in

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.230 
water in here you put your tap water in
there<00:04:59.830> you<00:04:59.950> not<00:05:00.100> like<00:05:00.220> your<00:05:00.340> sink<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.730> let<00:05:00.880> it

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
there you not like your sink and let it

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.310 
there you not like your sink and let it
run<00:05:01.300> through<00:05:01.450> there<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.140> slowly

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
run through there and then it slowly

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.900 
run through there and then it slowly
seeps<00:05:02.710> off<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.950> bottom<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.310> goes<00:05:03.430> into<00:05:03.610> here

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
seeps off the bottom and goes into here

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.610 
seeps off the bottom and goes into here
and<00:05:03.940> then<00:05:04.540> you<00:05:04.660> have<00:05:04.690> filtered<00:05:05.110> water<00:05:05.260> that's

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
and then you have filtered water that's

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.570 
and then you have filtered water that's
free<00:05:05.920> of<00:05:05.950> fluoride

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
free of fluoride

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.640 
free of fluoride
filipe<00:05:07.210> free<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.720> chlorine<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> free<00:05:08.560> of

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
filipe free of chlorine and the free of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.390 
filipe free of chlorine and the free of
those<00:05:08.740> heavy<00:05:08.950> metals

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
those heavy metals

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.770 
those heavy metals
and<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.870> think<00:05:11.350> it's<00:05:11.590> super<00:05:11.830> important<00:05:12.160> because

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
and I think it's super important because

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.390 
and I think it's super important because
the<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:14.139> water<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.680> your<00:05:14.830> body<00:05:14.979> runs<00:05:15.250> up

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
the the water that your body runs up

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.879 
the the water that your body runs up
with<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.760> kind<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.479> feels<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:17.050> if<00:05:17.740> you

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
with is kind of like feels so if you

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.040 
with is kind of like feels so if you
have<00:05:18.010> like<00:05:18.160> if<00:05:18.639> you<00:05:18.820> have<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.449> know<00:05:19.540> gas<00:05:19.780> for

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
have like if you have you know gas for

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.200 
have like if you have you know gas for
your<00:05:20.139> car<00:05:20.199> and<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.949> add<00:05:21.310> some<00:05:21.580> like<00:05:21.729> dirt<00:05:22.000> to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
your car and you add some like dirt to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.879 
your car and you add some like dirt to
it<00:05:22.300> or<00:05:22.419> some<00:05:22.570> chemicals<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.560> put<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.800> in

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
it or some chemicals and you put it in

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.469 
it or some chemicals and you put it in
your<00:05:23.979> car<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.490> expect<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.090> run<00:05:25.240> just

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
your car and you expect that to run just

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.290 
your car and you expect that to run just
as<00:05:25.540> well<00:05:25.750> as<00:05:25.870> like<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.020> high<00:05:26.590> octane<00:05:26.800> fuel<00:05:27.490> from

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
as well as like a high octane fuel from

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.210 
as well as like a high octane fuel from
a<00:05:28.419> race<00:05:28.600> car<00:05:28.900> it's<00:05:29.350> just<00:05:29.410> not<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.800> same<00:05:29.949> thing

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
a race car it's just not the same thing

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.460 
a race car it's just not the same thing
so<00:05:30.520> drinking<00:05:31.300> high-quality<00:05:31.810> water<00:05:31.930> is<00:05:32.169> really

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
so drinking high-quality water is really

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.590 
so drinking high-quality water is really
important<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.130> one<00:05:33.880> thing<00:05:34.030> that<00:05:34.180> I<00:05:34.240> notice<00:05:34.510> is

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
important and one thing that I notice is

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.150 
important and one thing that I notice is
when<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.750> started<00:05:35.050> using<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.380> shower<00:05:35.590> filter<00:05:35.860> I

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
when I started using a shower filter I

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.939 
when I started using a shower filter I
notice<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:36.790> right<00:05:37.060> away<00:05:37.120> my<00:05:37.570> skin<00:05:38.020> felt<00:05:38.470> much

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
notice that right away my skin felt much

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.129 
notice that right away my skin felt much
softer<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.580> even<00:05:40.000> my<00:05:40.090> hair<00:05:40.330> felt<00:05:40.690> software<00:05:41.080> as

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
softer and even my hair felt software as

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.550 
softer and even my hair felt software as
well

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
well

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.900 
well
my<00:05:41.860> skin<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.250> American<00:05:42.639> notice<00:05:42.850> that

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
my skin and American notice that

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.189 
my skin and American notice that
different<00:05:43.210> somehow<00:05:43.360> stuck<00:05:43.780> there<00:05:43.960> where<00:05:44.080> the

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
different somehow stuck there where the

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.300 
different somehow stuck there where the
water<00:05:44.229> wasn't<00:05:44.680> as<00:05:44.860> hard

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
water wasn't as hard

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.460 
water wasn't as hard
the<00:05:45.699> water<00:05:45.910> was<00:05:46.090> softer<00:05:46.600> though<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.020> was<00:05:47.350> more

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
the water was softer though it was more

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.740 
the water was softer though it was more
gentle<00:05:47.919> on<00:05:48.010> my<00:05:48.100> skin<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:49.060> just<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.630> a

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
gentle on my skin and it just it's a

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.810 
gentle on my skin and it just it's a
really<00:05:49.780> good<00:05:50.169> for<00:05:50.320> your<00:05:50.380> skin

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
really good for your skin

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.340 
really good for your skin
that's<00:05:51.820> how<00:05:51.940> well<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.240> shower<00:05:52.449> filter<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:52.990> a

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
that's how well the shower filter and a

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.529 
that's how well the shower filter and a
picture<00:05:53.590> it's<00:05:53.860> who<00:05:54.039> filter<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.580> water<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:55.060> the

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
picture it's who filter the water of the

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.000 
picture it's who filter the water of the
impurities<00:05:56.139> and<00:05:56.260> contaminate<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:56.740> we<00:05:56.860> don't

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
impurities and contaminate so we don't

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.140 
impurities and contaminate so we don't
even<00:05:57.160> know<00:05:57.280> what<00:05:57.400> else<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.639> on<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.880> water<00:05:57.970> so

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
even know what else is on the water so

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.939 
even know what else is on the water so
it's<00:05:58.270> just<00:05:58.360> good<00:05:58.570> to<00:05:58.600> have<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:59.050> filter<00:05:59.530> because

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
it's just good to have a filter because

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.500 
it's just good to have a filter because
it<00:05:59.979> could<00:06:00.220> remove<00:06:00.460> some<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.760> those<00:06:00.850> other

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
it could remove some of those other

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.180 
it could remove some of those other
things<00:06:01.930> as<00:06:02.139> well<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:02.350> gets<00:06:02.620> more<00:06:02.889> because

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
things as well that gets more because

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.950 
things as well that gets more because
unfortunately<00:06:03.880> in<00:06:04.300> today's<00:06:04.479> world<00:06:04.690> was<00:06:04.840> all

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
unfortunately in today's world was all

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.600 
unfortunately in today's world was all
the<00:06:05.050> chemicals<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:05.590> environmental<00:06:06.220> food<00:06:06.400> and

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
the chemicals and environmental food and

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.580 
the chemicals and environmental food and
all<00:06:06.669> these<00:06:06.760> other<00:06:06.940> things<00:06:07.030> it's<00:06:08.020> important<00:06:08.500> to

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
all these other things it's important to

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.770 
all these other things it's important to
filter<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.310> remove<00:06:09.430> these<00:06:09.699> things<00:06:09.910> and

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
filter and remove these things and

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.120 
filter and remove these things and
hopefully<00:06:10.990> we<00:06:11.320> can<00:06:11.350> live<00:06:11.590> in<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.710> world<00:06:11.830> someday

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
hopefully we can live in a world someday

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.920 
hopefully we can live in a world someday
where<00:06:12.760> we<00:06:12.850> don't<00:06:12.970> need<00:06:13.180> filters<00:06:13.599> and<00:06:13.810> purifies

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
where we don't need filters and purifies

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.120 
where we don't need filters and purifies
and<00:06:14.229> all<00:06:14.470> these<00:06:14.530> different<00:06:14.620> things<00:06:14.950> because

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
and all these different things because

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.250 
and all these different things because
we'll<00:06:15.880> just<00:06:15.910> live<00:06:16.450> greener<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.020> we<00:06:17.110> won't

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
we'll just live greener and we won't

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.659 
we'll just live greener and we won't
pollute<00:06:17.500> our<00:06:17.770> own<00:06:18.010> environment<00:06:18.550> which

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
pollute our own environment which

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:19.710 
pollute our own environment which
pollutes<00:06:18.910> our<00:06:19.000> health<00:06:19.210> which<00:06:19.389> is<00:06:19.510> kind<00:06:19.690> of

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
pollutes our health which is kind of

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.820 
pollutes our health which is kind of
ridiculous<00:06:20.020> if<00:06:20.229> you<00:06:20.260> think<00:06:20.470> about<00:06:20.590> it<00:06:20.710> but

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
ridiculous if you think about it but

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.190 
ridiculous if you think about it but
anyway<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:21.700> I<00:06:22.060> will<00:06:22.510> link<00:06:22.660> to<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:22.930> picture
