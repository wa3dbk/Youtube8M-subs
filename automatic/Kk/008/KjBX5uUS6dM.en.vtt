00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.740
 it's more than covered by the 

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.439
 hierarchy I give you another example 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.870
 is there we will understand that there is a 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.400
 compromise system that is who is 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.230
 formally engaged in 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.610
 armed forces and the public forces he 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 must talk about it must be the gendarmes 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.869
 the police the military 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.060
 they stop veiling their face and who 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.930
 understand in what they come in and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.929
 I need them 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.910
 choose their camp you heard 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.099
 talk about the turquoise dation operation 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.330
 well it's this poliseno pack which country and 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.169
 under what conditions were we then 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.809
 turquoise it will agree 94 years 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.790
 after the massacres between the Hutus and 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.160
 the Tutsis but where so there was there 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.840
 UN forces with units 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.440
 paratroopers who came to protect 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.719
 the refugees 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.340
 everything is fine on the occasion of this 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.640
 large turquoise operation 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.230
 you have to know that in the camps of 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.829
 refugees there were collective tents 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.140
 who were standing up climb is by 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.420
 example at 10 am every 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.359
 women girls pretty much drinking 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.640
 pardon for this term refugees were 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.350
 piled up was therefore made available 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
 in these collective tents and it was 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 rape time and I speak for them 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.200
 paratroopers the blue helmets of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.470
 the French army ok everyone 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.500
 was going everyone because that's 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.900
 organized by the officers and that you 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.280
 are a little nigger a little corporal 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.020
 as well as one for a chef or even a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.490
 sergeant you will not go against the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 officers that there is the mass effect 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.210
 This galvanizing wayne where it is 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.140
 some real ones were part of the team and 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.570
 it's even worse when you're in a 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.670
 special unit I went into a 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.410
 special unit after the gendarmerie where 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.500
 you have is how to say this elitism you 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.450
 see who comes to trap the most 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.340
 conceited and then make them participate 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 at the worst things are who finds nothing to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.330
 find it because it is there again 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.360
 where the human peaches the most is its 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.190
 vanity and the feeling of belonging to 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.110
 an elite they know how to play with that 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.680
 who manipulate us they know how to play 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.690
 with 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.800
 with this vanity it would have been stolen 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.760
 in the crates of quests where we have 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.620
 right to do things that others 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.350
 do not have no right to do that is 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.660
 also like that Freemasons 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 evolved ok is to put oneself above 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.850
 everyone laughs at us it is the elite 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.160
 the others are idiots and so this 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.980
 compromise system so it's 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.830
 in the gendarmerie the at the paras 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 in the army under conditions 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.190
 unsustainable since we are talking about camps 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.300
 of refugees no no I mean the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.640
 the height of human misery 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.180
 it was supposed to intervene for the tgv 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.110
 to help them and there is a omerta that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.760
 is overwhelming 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.110
 because above it there is a whole 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.370
 chain of command and the poor 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.870
 little holes that will open his 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.670
 mouth he will not make a fold or finish 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.360
 in asylum psychiatric asylum 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.980
 psychiatric 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.680
 so here I come back on my case to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.680
 me a few days
