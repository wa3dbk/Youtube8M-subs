00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:11.360
 Yes It is a long-sleeved research institute teaching corner that has started now Horner from everyone 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.460
 Although over to you doing me for the question it's something that has to answer 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.970
 I'm going fast 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.380
 Test 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.890
 Is it water sports? 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.930
 Roy is a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.370
 I say from the conclusion 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.130
 The next is not sports 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.360
 It's a thing Tteyuu by warm faction 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.920
 day 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:40.880
 Kedomo this that is I think the audience of the volcano it's probably likely 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.860
 At roughly position was Anything I I Sports 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.280
 Excuse me 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.980
 Oh dear 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.820
 Not you content is sports like doing on whether and I would Do sports news I say 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.490
 I'd say if there What Toka Toka baseball soccer 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 in tennis 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.840
 I think that's what it is 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.060
 This only it goes to say personal Utte 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.360
 In terms of selection, there are three conditions for sports 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.670
 Three 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.509
 First of all I 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.509
 Rules and Referee 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.810
 I heard but it is 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.650
 There is victory and loss 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.260
 There is a third audience 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.450
 Sometimes this is complete 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.650
 Maybe Kana general of the people not a sport that do that kind of mon, such'm me anymore Eigaku Sports 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.980
 It is said that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.190
 I think 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.520
 In Nee Well 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.400
 If that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.300
 Softening anything that 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.550
 This kind of relationship is good 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.610
 It's like I'm already in the conditions. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.570
 There will be wins and losses in the next tournament, but 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.760
 It sounds Ne Ja do different 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.240
 It's something like that, but the rules are also new 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.369
 Even if there is a rule, there will be no referee 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.369
 Therefore the I'm just Tteyuu pe people have not Ciocco Hotel &amp; Resort 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.060
 Other sports will have to do so to roughly 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.760
 Because people who say good are always said 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.760
 The Kedomo thing say it is not the time of the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.840
 I later 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.020
 I guess strike 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.570
 What a sport in fishing 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.750
 If you think that you don't like it, I will say many times study but 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.550
 I think Usan Chima do 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.790
 Well, those people are 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.390
 Do you think we'd better after all I was thinking the other in a little objectively 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.890
 In such a story is the I mean I'm there be another to the next is something you Tokusuru in Sports 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.870
 The Fu that even if there 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.620
 There are many tests 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 Hey 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.920
 Oh dear 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.080
 I'm sorry 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.120
 First of all 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:14.970
 I think it's probably a bad thing even if you say that people doing sports are 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:20.750
 It's a sport for the first time when people around me recognize it 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.750
 I think I'm not a sport unless it's something 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.410
 It I 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:31.250
 Have there is you in without permission Sports 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:35.290
 So , for example, after being recognized as the sport, what does the person get? 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.610
 I think this is a story I was working hard I there to not get anything 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.830
 Moncolle is good 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.410
 think 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.340
 I wonder what I already say but I say it over and over again 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.200
 Well for sports 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.739
 I fell in love with sports 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.930
 Well, while saying that Lusanchiman oboe 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.930
 Lord will get thought
