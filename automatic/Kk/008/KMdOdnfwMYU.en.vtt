00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.800 

now<00:01:44.350> where<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.250> work<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.940> lot<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.540> different

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now where I work a lot of different

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.740 
now where I work a lot of different
artists<00:01:47.170> do<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.410> same<00:01:47.680> design<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.720> lot<00:01:49.720> of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
artists do the same design a lot of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.860 
artists do the same design a lot of
reason<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.380> stenciling<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.660> that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
reason for the stenciling and so that

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.470 
reason for the stenciling and so that
they<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.230> be<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> little<00:01:53.530> more<00:01:53.710> uniform<00:01:54.480> same

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
they can be a little more uniform same

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.860 
they can be a little more uniform same
guy<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.720> may<00:01:56.020> not<00:01:56.200> be<00:01:56.320> working<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.740> same<00:01:56.980> shift

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
guy I may not be working the same shift

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.450 
guy I may not be working the same shift
when<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:58.960> same<00:01:59.200> family<00:01:59.650> comes<00:01:59.830> back<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.310> gets

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
when the same family comes back and gets

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.830 
when the same family comes back and gets
the<00:02:00.550> same<00:02:00.790> design<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.450> want<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.660> try<00:02:01.780> to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the same design so you want to try to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.450 
the same design so you want to try to
keep<00:02:02.110> them<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:03.790> close<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:05.170> possible<00:02:05.460> that's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
keep them as close to possible that's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.919 
keep them as close to possible that's
what<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:06.730> look<00:02:06.880> like<00:02:06.910> on<00:02:07.270> display<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.720> is

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
what they look like on display this is

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.660 
what they look like on display this is
sort<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.410> like<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.920> kitty<00:02:12.160> design

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
sort of like a little kitty design

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.470 
sort of like a little kitty design

mostly a little scared fish running from
a<00:02:16.540> shark<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.530> merely<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.950> show<00:02:21.160> you

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
a shark but it's just merely to show you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.910 
a shark but it's just merely to show you
a<00:02:21.310> technique<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.300> can<00:02:22.330> use<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.740> just

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
a technique that you can use and just

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.520 
a technique that you can use and just
about<00:02:24.160> anything<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:25.090> would<00:02:25.900> write<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> name

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
about anything I would write a name

typically above this lettering with the
same<00:02:44.860> color<00:02:47.640> most<00:02:48.640> people<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.300> tag

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
same color most people like the tag

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.309 
same color most people like the tag
where<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:49.930> from<00:02:50.140> again

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.539 

all<00:02:56.159> script<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.849> time<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.040> I'd<00:02:59.159> be<00:02:59.340> finished

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
all script this time and I'd be finished

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.429 
all script this time and I'd be finished
with<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> part<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> next<00:03:01.230> thing<00:03:01.349> I

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
with that part of the next thing I

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.740 
with that part of the next thing I
picked<00:03:01.650> out<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.010> B<00:03:02.129> blue<00:03:02.599> coloring<00:03:03.599> that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
picked out the B blue coloring that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.830 
picked out the B blue coloring that
start<00:03:07.970> don't<00:03:08.970> even<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.480> go<00:03:09.569> all<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:09.780> way

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
start don't even have to go all the way

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.140 
start don't even have to go all the way
to<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.140> edge<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.530> line<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:11.069> can<00:03:11.189> because<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
to the edge of the line I can because I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.030 
to the edge of the line I can because I
got<00:03:12.329> blue<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.840> yellow<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> outside<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.920> it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
got blue and yellow on the outside of it

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.490 
got blue and yellow on the outside of it
