00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.869
 64 years ago 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.430
 exactly November 21, 1943 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.800
 pietransieri was the victim of a Nazi massacre unmatched in Italy 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.250
 for the monumental relationship between the inhabitants and the victims 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.060
 128 were slaughtered including 60 women and 34 children under 10 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.109
 years 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.580
 while the country had only 4 500 souls who live mainly from agriculture and 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.939
 sheep-farming 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.350
 following the fall of the fascist regime in Italy in 1943 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 and the following pact I say belligerency with the allies 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.060
 hitler that his germany feeling betrayed currently alaric plan 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.310
 sending many troops of our state 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.790
 12 September of '43 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.220
 Mussolini was freed from his I to emperor camp by means of 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.220
 German paratroopers escorted him to Germany 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.440
 from that moment we begin serious problems of the state of Rome which is located there 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 split in two with the Germans in the north 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.490
 and the allies to the south of the famously famous Gustav line 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 pietransieri at the time 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.680
 he had the misfortune of being a nerve center of this defensive line 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 important also thanks to the height of more than 1,350 meters above sea level 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 in the woods that made it easily defensible 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.050
 around mid-October the Germans decided on harlock and many garrisons 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.230
 soldiers settled here 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.770
 gradually they increased in number 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.030
 and their economic demands for food increase hand in hand 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 then they also began to request people to work for them and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.050
 this caused many to the spot by hiding themselves in the woods not to come 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.040
 caught 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.500
 only returning the night to sleep in their homes 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.670
 but on October 30, 1943 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 being in a war zone he arrives at the German Marshal Albert 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.260
 Kesselring, 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.080
 the evacuation order for all pietransieri site that had to go 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 towards sulmona 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 the disobedient would have been considered the rebels 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.109
 some decided to follow the order hey got on Italian 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.919
 they left with hearts full of sadness and doubts about their future 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.049
 many more though 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.250
 they hoped for the sudden arrival of the allied troops 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.629
 deciding to hide in my husband's woods 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.629
 trusting not to be discovered three thick woods 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.339
 however, the soldiers soon began to explore more and more depth 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.409
 shooting quoto and trying to convince everyone to leave 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.339
 in the days before the massacre 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:42.379
 especially since November 16, already at 18 people were killed between expressions of 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.869
 mine the machine gun shots 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.949
 we approach the fateful November 21st 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:52.209
 on the previous day, an allied attack that sells postponed is expected 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.659
 only for bad weather conditions 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.129
 the Germans who felt strongly threatened therefore the lieutenant show le 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.809
 bourget 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:05.329
 he orders the killing of all civilians who still have a security belt 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.489
 needing to keep it free for the success of military operations 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.259
 many citizens, aware of the situation, asked for the means 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:20.229
 to transport children by allowing them to move away but instead of kaname 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.359
 only 6 or 7 soldiers arrived 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.620
 one of them with the inquiries of goodness help some to escape but the others 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.779
 they passed from cottage to solar ca to kill 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.700
 at the end of the day 110 people a real massacre 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:43.659
 in 1967 it was conferred by the then head of state giuseppe saragat to the municipality 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.369

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.979
 annually there is a torchlight procession on November 20 followed by a celebration 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.770
 on the 21st 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.579
 this year they were present besides the authorities 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.659

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.799

 have decided to commemorate the fallen by walking along the stretch of road 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.419
 rural pietransieri tarocca 5 miles 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.789

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.900

 is to continue to keep alive the sacrifice of those who die only for 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.629
 not having left their place for eurosport 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.289
 it is a massacre of rest all the massacres are unjust 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.139
 every time 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.409

 but this is a particularly unjust massacre 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.110
 but we must remember 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.360
 not only 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.559
 we must elaborate 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.339
 of new content 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.669

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.659
 of overcoming barriers 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:35.839
 from Monday 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.259
 for the future 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.330

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.020

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.029
 it's not just a poignant and painful presence 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.389
 in memory of people who are no longer with us 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.349
 when known 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.469

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.400
 I too have experienced this great 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.800
 while you today 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.499

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.139
 He died in Russia 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.089
 nobody told me tube like when 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:27.320
 the serious thing 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.529

 going to meet 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:48.089
 all principles all rules all laws and ethics avoid 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:52.729
 take advantage of weapons against defenseless citizens with drawn stars 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.169
 the civilization of love 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.430
 of the brotherhood of concord of the truth of freedom 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.689
 of justice and peace 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.789
