00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
told this I researched it and I actually

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
told this I researched it and I actually
did<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.149> two

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
did not do this for like the first two

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
did not do this for like the first two
weeks<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.670> weeks

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
weeks but then I'm like it's two weeks

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
weeks but then I'm like it's two weeks
like<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.989> should<00:01:04.260> be

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
like it should be

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.050 
like it should be
I<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.610> fully<00:01:05.790> healed

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I know it's not gonna be fully healed

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
I know it's not gonna be fully healed
but<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.710> bad<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but I think it's not as bad as when I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
but I think it's not as bad as when I
first<00:01:08.670> came<00:01:08.909> home<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.409> point

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
first came home with it so at some point

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
first came home with it so at some point
though<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.250> sleep<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.729> my<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.720> kind

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
though I sleep on my back I kind of kind

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.469 
though I sleep on my back I kind of kind
of<00:01:13.020> roll<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.229> onto<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.430> side<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of roll over onto my right side and I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
of roll over onto my right side and I
felt<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:16.979> sleeping<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
felt like if I was sleeping like this or

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.060 
felt like if I was sleeping like this or
balancing<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.259> ear<00:01:19.500> wasn't<00:01:19.890> being

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
balancing it so my ear wasn't being

balancing it so my ear wasn't being
touched<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.430> thought<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.939> okay<00:01:21.240> well

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fine one day the next day it would start

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.100 
fine one day the next day it would start
to<00:01:30.869> ache<00:01:31.049> again<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> find<00:01:33.990> that

change<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.840> piercing<00:03:43.320> until<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.730> feels<00:03:44.970> like

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
change the piercing until it feels like

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.790 
change the piercing until it feels like
it's<00:03:45.330> healed<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:46.140> they<00:03:46.380> should<00:03:46.560> recommend

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
it's healed I know they should recommend

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.270 
it's healed I know they should recommend
a<00:03:47.010> time<00:03:47.250> period<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.240> like<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.570> said<00:03:49.050> before<00:03:49.680> if

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
a time period but like I said before if

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.640 
a time period but like I said before if
the<00:03:50.459> process<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.209> not<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:52.050> it's<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:52.350> healing

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
the process is not if it's not healing

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.340 
the process is not if it's not healing
as<00:03:53.160> well<00:03:53.730> as<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.240> should<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.600> or<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.080> should

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
as well as it should be or as it should

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.580 
as well as it should be or as it should
be<00:03:55.530> then<00:03:56.040> obviously<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:57.600> taking<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.440> out

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
be then obviously the taking it out

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.630 
be then obviously the taking it out
there's<00:03:58.860> probably<00:03:59.040> take<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> little<00:03:59.489> bit

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
there's probably take a little bit

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.100 
there's probably take a little bit
longer

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
longer

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.620 
longer
I<00:04:01.430> heard<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.580> healing<00:04:02.940> time<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.330> these<00:04:03.480> are

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
I heard that healing time for these are

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.970 
I heard that healing time for these are
generally<00:04:04.080> 4-6<00:04:04.739> weeks<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:06.800> mind<00:04:07.800> is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
generally 4-6 weeks and I mind is

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.460 
generally 4-6 weeks and I mind is
probably<00:04:08.400> going<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.360> think<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.320> probably

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
probably going on I think it's probably

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.920 
probably going on I think it's probably
week<00:04:10.709> four<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.850> relatively<00:04:12.270> new<00:04:12.480> still

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
week four so it's relatively new still

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.320 
week four so it's relatively new still
it's<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.350> got<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.650> around<00:04:13.920> Chris<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.970> Christmas

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
it's I got it around Chris the Christmas

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.300 
it's I got it around Chris the Christmas
holiday<00:04:15.690> New<00:04:15.870> Year's<00:04:16.140> actually<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:17.040> think

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
holiday New Year's actually so I think

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.560 
holiday New Year's actually so I think
it's<00:04:17.609> right<00:04:17.910> around<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.269> four

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
it's right around the four

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.860 
it's right around the four
four-and-a-half<00:04:19.169> week<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:20.250> mark<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.510> have

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
four-and-a-half week to mark that I have

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.890 
four-and-a-half week to mark that I have
had<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.730> starting<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.660> heal

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
had it and it's just starting to heal

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.930 
had it and it's just starting to heal
because<00:04:25.350> I've<00:04:25.620> been<00:04:25.980> implementing<00:04:26.729> these

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
because I've been implementing these

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.270 
because I've been implementing these
rules<00:04:27.270> more<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.810> more<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.470> was<00:04:28.770> using<00:04:29.010> the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
rules more and more so I was using the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.480 
rules more and more so I was using the
antibacterial<00:04:29.900> soap<00:04:30.900> initially<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.130> I

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
antibacterial soap initially and I

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.430 
antibacterial soap initially and I
didn't<00:04:32.820> fiddle<00:04:33.180> with<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:34.140> was

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
didn't fiddle with it and I was

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.630 
didn't fiddle with it and I was
relatively<00:04:36.320> gentle<00:04:37.320> with<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.680> but<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.340> wasn't

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
relatively gentle with it but I wasn't

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.360 
relatively gentle with it but I wasn't
so<00:04:39.390> good<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.900> not<00:04:40.290> sleeping<00:04:40.740> on<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:40.919> I<00:04:41.160> did

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
so good on not sleeping on it I did

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.370 
so good on not sleeping on it I did
sleep<00:04:41.580> on<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.910> which<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.180> keeping<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.690> making

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
sleep on it which was keeping it making

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.380 
sleep on it which was keeping it making
it<00:04:43.470> sore<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.580> wasn't<00:04:44.729> letting<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.120> breathe

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
it sore and it wasn't letting it breathe

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.930 
it sore and it wasn't letting it breathe
and<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:46.229> from<00:04:46.530> time<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.919> time<00:04:46.950> my<00:04:47.520> hair<00:04:47.790> would

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and then from time to time my hair would

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.909 
and then from time to time my hair would
yank<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.810> would<00:04:48.960> just<00:04:49.140> oh<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.680> would<00:04:49.890> be

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
yank on it and would just oh it would be

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.070 
yank on it and would just oh it would be
so<00:04:50.100> painful<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.720> was<00:04:51.840> already

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
so painful because it was already

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.360 
so painful because it was already
irritated<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:54.080> didn't<00:04:55.080> work<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:55.350> now<00:04:55.860> that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.250 
irritated and didn't work so now that
I'm<00:04:56.880> implementing<00:04:57.419> all<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.870> these<00:04:57.990> strategies

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
I'm implementing all of these strategies

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.219 
I'm implementing all of these strategies
