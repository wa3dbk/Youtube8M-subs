00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
positioning is also very terrible I have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.720 
positioning is also very terrible I have
to<00:03:00.200> force<00:03:00.410> him<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.650> make<00:03:00.800> runs<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.220> play<00:03:01.400> you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
to force him to make runs and play you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.730 
to force him to make runs and play you
know<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> press<00:03:02.420> alt<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.020> make<00:03:03.530> him

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
know I have to press alt and make him

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.110 
know I have to press alt and make him
make<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.950> run<00:03:04.220> he<00:03:04.370> doesn't<00:03:04.460> really<00:03:04.700> do<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:04.910> his

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
make a run he doesn't really do on his

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.900 
make a run he doesn't really do on his
own<00:03:05.330> which<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.900> problem<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.520> know<00:03:07.610> it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
own which is a problem and you know it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.520

can't<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> problem<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.780> finally<00:03:09.350> he's<00:03:09.500> just

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
can't be a problem and finally he's just

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.170 
can't be a problem and finally he's just
very<00:03:09.800> inconsistent<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.880> know<00:03:11.000> his
