00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:19.470
 I had the worst mom in the world 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.880
 while other children did not have to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.750
 I had to eat cereal 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.750
 eggs and toast 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.580
 when the others drank sodas and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.550
 sweets for lunch 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.030
 I had to eat a sandwich and a 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.030
 smoothie 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.600
 my mother always insisted on knowing in 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.059
 where were we 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.859
 I also had to know who they were 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.360
 our friends and what we were 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:53.359
 doing insisted that if we said that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.220
 We were going to take an hour only 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.460
 we will take an hour 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.350
 I'm ashamed to admit it but until 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.970
 had the nerve to break the laws 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.590
 against child labor 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.320
 its going to show you these 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.500
 let's sell ranges that we learned to 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 cook to iron and many things 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.460
 equally cruel 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.670
 I even think she was awake in 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 the night thinking about the things that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 could force us to do 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.900
 always insisted that we say the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.900
 true 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 and when we reach adolescence 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.909
 our life became even more miserable 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 nobody could touch the horn so that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.010
 we ran out we were ashamed 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.960
 to the extreme, forcing our 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.490
 friends to get to the door to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490
 ask for us 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.700
 my mother was a complete failure 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.980
 none of us has been arrested 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.890
 each of my brothers has served in 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.890
 a mission and also to our country 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.590
 and to whom we should blame 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 you are right to our mother 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.880
 Look at all that we have lost 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.960
 we have never been able to participate in a 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.250
 manifestation in violent acts and thousands 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.940
 of more things that our 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.940
 friends 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.770
 it made us become adults 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.310
 educated and honest workers 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.450
 responsible 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.450
 and they know something 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.180
 taking this reference 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.490
 I am trying to educate my children 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.530
 in the same way 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.180
 and I thank God 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.609
 for giving me 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.609
 the most evil mom in the world
