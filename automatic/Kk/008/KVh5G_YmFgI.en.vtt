show us this method here in just a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.670 
show us this method here in just a
moment<00:00:53.330> once<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:53.510> get<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:53.780> unhooked<00:00:54.050> I've<00:00:54.530> got

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
take his bait and he would run the line

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
take his bait and he would run the line
through<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.020> he<00:01:19.260> take<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> hook<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.910> in<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
come out and then thread the hook

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.070 
come out and then thread the hook
through<00:01:31.190> see<00:01:32.190> how<00:01:32.340> i'm<00:01:32.490> doing<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:32.940> just<00:01:33.810> pull

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
through see how i'm doing this just pull

through see how i'm doing this just pull
it<00:01:34.110> through<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:36.140> take<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> hook<00:01:37.470> again<00:01:37.649> go

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it through and take the hook again go

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.010 
it through and take the hook again go
right<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:38.910> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.330> same<00:01:39.479> hole<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:39.930> be

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
right back in the same hole but be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.389 
right back in the same hole but be
careful<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> don't<00:01:40.800> hook<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.220> line

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
careful that you don't hook your line

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.060 
careful that you don't hook your line
and<00:01:41.990> come<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.410> fish<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.860> bit

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and come down the fish a little bit

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.020 
and come down the fish a little bit
farther<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.630> come<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.229> again

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
farther and come through them again

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
farther and come through them again
thread<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.060> through<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.720> you'll<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
thread it through and you'll see how the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.420 
thread it through and you'll see how the
whole<00:01:50.840> hook<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> basically<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.100> right

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
whole hook is basically going right

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.810 
whole hook is basically going right
through<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.790> bait<00:01:55.040> I'm<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.399> careful

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
through the bait I'm going to be careful

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.840 
through the bait I'm going to be careful
that<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.320> look<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.380> line

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.820 

and<00:02:02.450> what<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.750> his<00:02:02.900> reasoning<00:02:03.320> for<00:02:03.470> doing<00:02:03.530> it

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and what is his reasoning for doing it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.949 
and what is his reasoning for doing it
this<00:02:03.979> way<00:02:04.040> Steve<00:02:04.630> he<00:02:05.630> claims<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.909> as<00:02:07.959> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
this way Steve he claims that as the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.860 
this way Steve he claims that as the
bait<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.880> going<00:02:10.880> through<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.270> water<00:02:11.480> it's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
bait is is going through the water it's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.170 
bait is is going through the water it's
leaving<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.350> scent<00:02:12.650> trail<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.850> fish<00:02:14.150> is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
leaving a scent trail and that fish is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.960 
leaving a scent trail and that fish is
going<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.630> pick<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.310> pick<00:02:16.310> up<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.670> scent

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
going to pick it up pick up that scent

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.309 
going to pick it up pick up that scent
trail<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.450> he's<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> come<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.140> behind

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
trail and he's going to come up behind

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.809 
trail and he's going to come up behind
the<00:02:18.739> bait<00:02:18.950> from<00:02:19.220> behind<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:20.000> he's<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the bait from behind and he's going to

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.840 
the bait from behind and he's going to
he's<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> hit<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.330> bait<00:02:23.660> from<00:02:24.319> behind

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
he's going to hit the bait from behind

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.140 
he's going to hit the bait from behind
so<00:02:25.850> he<00:02:26.090> wanted<00:02:26.569> his<00:02:26.810> hook<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.430> back<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
so he wanted his hook on the back of the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.900 
so he wanted his hook on the back of the
bait<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.380> as<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.800> approached<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.550> hit<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
bait so as it approached it and hit the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.780 
bait so as it approached it and hit the
beat<00:02:32.090> from<00:02:32.330> behind<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.160> first<00:02:34.430> thing<00:02:34.640> it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
beat from behind if the first thing it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.570 
beat from behind if the first thing it
was<00:02:34.940> going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.209> meet<00:02:35.360> was<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.810> hook<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
was going to meet was the hook and the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.820 
was going to meet was the hook and the
other<00:02:37.730> thing<00:02:37.850> was<00:02:38.239> your<00:02:38.900> bait<00:02:39.110> just<00:02:39.440> doesn't
