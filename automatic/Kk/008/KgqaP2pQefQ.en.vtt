00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
actual architecture work but you want to

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.100 
actual architecture work but you want to
go<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.099> top<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.150> want<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> build<00:02:16.930> up

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
go to the top and you want to build up

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.569 
go to the top and you want to build up
around<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.440> corner<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.459> have

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.940 
around the corner and you want to have
little<00:02:18.790> blocks<00:02:19.209> up<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.049> it<00:02:20.290> doesn't<00:02:20.560> spread

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
little blocks up so it doesn't spread

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.430 
little blocks up so it doesn't spread
behind<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:22.299> goes<00:02:22.510> one<00:02:22.780> direction<00:02:23.290> and
