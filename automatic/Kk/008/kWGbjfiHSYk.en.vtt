00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
worth a while back but I can remember

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.859 
worth a while back but I can remember
that<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.030> said<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.390> come<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.840> some

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that they said they come with some

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
that they said they come with some
different<00:02:01.680> weapon<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.040> packaging

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they come in the normal blaster so I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.949 
they come in the normal blaster so I
suppose<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> would<00:02:08.520> mean<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.390> bit

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
suppose it would mean be good a bit

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.730 
suppose it would mean be good a bit
better<00:02:10.140> affair

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740
