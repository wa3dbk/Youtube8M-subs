do running right now but we you know

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.250 
do running right now but we you know
that<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.970> time<00:03:30.180> frame<00:03:30.390> allows<00:03:30.630> us<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.020> give<00:03:31.140> it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
that the time frame allows us to give it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.500 
that the time frame allows us to give it
more<00:03:31.380> time<00:03:31.440> regardless<00:03:32.130> but<00:03:32.400> we'll<00:03:33.270> slowly

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
more time regardless but we'll slowly

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300 
more time regardless but we'll slowly
bring<00:03:33.840> them<00:03:33.959> out<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.140> get<00:03:34.890> them<00:03:34.980> ready<00:03:35.070> it's

bring them out and get them ready it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.560 
bring them out and get them ready it's
just<00:03:35.459> knocking<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> rust<00:03:35.910> off<00:03:36.090> as<00:03:36.270> all<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.480> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
just knocking the rust off as all it is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.150 
just knocking the rust off as all it is

he trying it defying that was an

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.220 
he trying it defying that was an
unusually<00:03:38.580> quiet<00:03:38.940> offseason<00:03:39.330> for<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.020> you

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
outlook of the team this year I love our

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.150 
outlook of the team this year I love our
pitching<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.230> know<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.860> we<00:03:46.980> have

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
pitching you know I think that we have

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.130 
pitching you know I think that we have
one<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.700> stronger<00:03:47.970> staffs<00:03:48.360> top<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.870> bottom

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
one of the stronger staffs top to bottom

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.390 
one of the stronger staffs top to bottom
in<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.350> game<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.860> think<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:50.100> going<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
in the game and I think that's going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.500 
in the game and I think that's going to
be<00:03:50.550> something<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.970> we're<00:03:51.150> going<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.300> need<00:03:51.420> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
be something that we're going to need to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.330 
be something that we're going to need to
carry<00:03:51.750> us<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.200> had<00:03:52.350> some<00:03:52.650> significant<00:03:53.160> losses

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
carry us we had some significant losses

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.100 
carry us we had some significant losses
but<00:03:53.610> i<00:03:53.670> think<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.270> know<00:03:54.300> an<00:03:54.420> alex<00:03:54.690> rodriguez's

excited to have Kevin and I think he's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.210
