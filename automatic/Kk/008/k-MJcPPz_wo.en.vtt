00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:07.774
 Hello! For a long time Liza was not in my videos 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.380
 Today, Lisa and I arrived at Ueno. 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.300
 And this is Starbucks in Ueno Park 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 And today begins the sale of drinks with the taste of sakura 

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.411
 And we came to try it. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.600
 And here is the turn 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.200
 These drinks are very popular and so we arrived early. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.900
 And here is the real Sakura! 

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:41.073
 Only one tree has bloomed! 

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.048
 let's get a look 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 This is a kind of sakura that blooms in cold weather (kandzakura) 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.809
 Still February and cold and she is already blooming 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.560
 We stood in line a bit and finally bought! 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.760
 Caramelly Sakura Chocolate Latte 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 Caramelly Sakura Chocolate Frappuchino 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 Now all the drinks are poured into these cute cups with sakura 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580
 I was really looking forward to these drinks with sakura! 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.720
 We will review them 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 delicious! 

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:41.795
 Taste is milky and creamy with cherry. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.620
 Tepid 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.280
 Taste like some kind of cherry milk. 

00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:59.073
 Delicious! 

00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:04.314
 This drink is white chocolate flavored. 

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.647
 And this is not coffee 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.929
 I donâ€™t like coffee so much 

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.333
 And the next drink with the same taste, only frappuccino 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.480
 Delicious! 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 This drink in a clear glass therefore looks especially cute. 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.620
 Taste almost like previous drink 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.740
 But here at the very bottom is something like a cherry blossom syrup 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.300
 The balance of taste is slightly different, somewhere very sweet, somewhere not very 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.780
 This syrup is very sweet 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.660
 I'll try! 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.860
 Yummy! 

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:02.982
 This drink has a stronger cherry flavor. 

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.935
 And this drink is more milky 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 And this one is more cherry 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 Very sweet 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.340
 And we bought a cake with sakura 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.720
 Here is a real sakura flower! 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.980
 Delicious! 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.740
 And I will try this flower sakura 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.580
 Salty, as if pickled 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.560
 In the sweet cake a little salted flower 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.180
 Now various cups and glasses and so on with sakura are on sale. 

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:02.153
 I would really like myself! 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.120
 So these were new starbak-flavored drinks from Sakura. 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.160
 Anyone interested would recommend to try 

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:15.634
 Thank you for watching!
