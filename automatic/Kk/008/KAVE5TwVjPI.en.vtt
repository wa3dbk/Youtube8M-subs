00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
per hour that you are receiving at the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.050 
per hour that you are receiving at the
particular<00:01:06.630> location<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.850> this

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
particular location as we look at this

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
particular location as we look at this
we<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.520> we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
we can also go all the way down and we

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.450 
we can also go all the way down and we
see<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> small

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
see that in here we have a small

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
see that in here we have a small
radiation<00:01:15.360> shield<00:01:15.990> inside<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> radiation

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
radiation shield inside that radiation

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.359 
radiation shield inside that radiation
shield<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> temperature<00:01:18.990> humidity<00:01:19.369> sensor

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
shield is a temperature humidity sensor

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
shield is a temperature humidity sensor
this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.000> great<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.810> gives<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this is great because it gives you the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
this is great because it gives you the
temperature<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:24.420> give<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.840> dew

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
temperature it also will give you dew

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.230 
temperature it also will give you dew
point<00:01:25.619> which<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> chasers<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
point which for a lot of chasers and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
point which for a lot of chasers and
storm<00:01:27.570> spotters<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> emergency<00:01:28.890> management

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
storm spotters and emergency management

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
storm spotters and emergency management
personnel<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.119> dew<00:01:30.299> point<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.409> important

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
personnel the dew point is so important

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
personnel the dew point is so important
now<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.140> take<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
now as we actually take a look at the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
now as we actually take a look at the
underside<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> I'll<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.990> ahead<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
underside of it and I'll go ahead and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
underside of it and I'll go ahead and
tip<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> ease<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
tip this up so we can see the ease that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.249 
tip this up so we can see the ease that
it<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> mounted<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:42.060> pole<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.020> uses

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
up this side and then the tips back it's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.130 
up this side and then the tips back it's
also<00:04:07.130> known<00:04:07.550> as<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.760> self-emptying<00:04:08.600> rain

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
also known as a self-emptying rain

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.740 
also known as a self-emptying rain
budget<00:04:09.620> because<00:04:10.340> as<00:04:10.610> we'll<00:04:10.880> take<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.330> camera

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
budget because as we'll take the camera

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.290 
budget because as we'll take the camera
over<00:04:12.050> here<00:04:12.320> we<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.710> see<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.490> side<00:04:13.790> has

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
over here we can see that this side has

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.330 
over here we can see that this side has
perforations<00:04:14.990> in<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.800> bottom<00:04:16.160> of<00:04:16.310> it

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
perforations in the bottom of it

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.610 
perforations in the bottom of it
therefore<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.180> water<00:04:17.359> comes<00:04:17.870> out<00:04:18.170> of<00:04:18.320> here

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
therefore the water comes out of here

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.070 
therefore the water comes out of here
right<00:04:19.310> out<00:04:19.580> of<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.880> sensors<00:04:20.330> and<00:04:20.570> onto<00:04:20.989> the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
right out of the sensors and onto the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.870 
right out of the sensors and onto the
ground<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.040> don't<00:04:22.220> have<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.550> worry<00:04:22.760> about

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
ground and you don't have to worry about

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 
ground and you don't have to worry about
getting<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.419> inside<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.710> tipping<00:04:25.040> rain

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280

bucket<00:04:25.730> web<00:04:25.970> or<00:04:26.300> any<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.960> electronics<00:04:27.620> so

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
bucket web or any of the electronics so

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.159 
bucket web or any of the electronics so
you<00:04:28.400> can<00:04:28.640> see<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.780> really<00:04:29.930> good

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
you can see this is really really good

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.710 
you can see this is really really good
and<00:04:30.380> yes<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.890> is<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.160> same<00:04:31.430> type<00:04:31.820> of<00:04:31.850> rain

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
and yes this is the same type of rain

unique well let's go ahead and take a
look<00:05:29.399> at<00:05:29.549> this<00:05:29.869> this<00:05:30.869> can<00:05:31.139> actually<00:05:31.439> be

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:31.709 
look at this this can actually be

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:34.159 
look at this this can actually be
separated<00:05:32.610> from<00:05:33.209> the<00:05:33.479> entire<00:05:33.839> weather

separated from the entire weather
station<00:05:34.709> you<00:05:35.129> can<00:05:35.309> take<00:05:35.550> this<00:05:35.789> one<00:05:36.029> this

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
station you can take this one this

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.850 
station you can take this one this
anemometer<00:05:37.379> and<00:05:37.619> raise<00:05:38.339> it<00:05:38.579> up<00:05:38.789> to<00:05:39.419> around<00:05:40.379> 10

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
by the National Weather Service now a

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.579 
by the National Weather Service now a
lot<00:06:06.899> of<00:06:07.050> these<00:06:07.169> items<00:06:07.409> have<00:06:08.129> solar<00:06:08.939> panels<00:06:09.589> so

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
lot of these items have solar panels so

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.619 
lot of these items have solar panels so
let's<00:06:10.800> take<00:06:11.039> a<00:06:11.069> look<00:06:11.339> at<00:06:11.459> this<00:06:11.669> this<00:06:12.269> solar

pressure and for a lot of the
meteorologists<00:07:05.339> instead<00:07:05.969> of<00:07:06.089> using<00:07:06.360> the

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:06.809 
meteorologists instead of using the

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.409 
meteorologists instead of using the
barometric<00:07:07.559> pressure<00:07:08.069> they<00:07:08.639> can<00:07:08.699> actually

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
barometric pressure they can actually

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.649 
barometric pressure they can actually
switch<00:07:09.719> this<00:07:09.990> to<00:07:10.379> millibars<00:07:11.009> so<00:07:11.789> it's<00:07:12.179> a<00:07:12.329> very

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
switch this to millibars so it's a very

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.169 
switch this to millibars so it's a very
very<00:07:13.099> versatile<00:07:14.099> weather<00:07:14.429> station<00:07:14.969> and
