00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
without further ado let's get started

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
first thing we're going to do is go to

and click on backup on our store then

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.549 
and click on backup on our store then
you're<00:00:28.270> going<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.450> create<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:29.050> system<00:00:29.320> image

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:29.559 
you're going to create a system image

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.429 
you're going to create a system image
and<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:31.480> going<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.660> search<00:00:31.809> for<00:00:31.840> an<00:00:32.140> external

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
and it's going to search for an external

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.110 
and it's going to search for an external
hard<00:00:32.739> drive<00:00:32.800> you're<00:00:33.489> going<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.670> need<00:00:33.820> dev<00:00:33.970> one

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
hard drive you're going to need dev one

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.610 
hard drive you're going to need dev one
of<00:00:34.210> those<00:00:34.360> or<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> DVD<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:35.140> be<00:00:35.230> able<00:00:35.379> to<00:00:35.440> backup

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
of those or a DVD to be able to backup

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.439 
of those or a DVD to be able to backup
this<00:00:35.920> image<00:00:36.219> on<00:00:36.370> if<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.969> have<00:00:37.059> a<00:00:37.120> really<00:00:37.390> small

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
this image on if you have a really small

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.419 
this image on if you have a really small
image<00:00:37.899> you<00:00:38.050> might<00:00:38.260> be<00:00:38.410> able<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.590> use<00:00:38.679> a<00:00:38.710> DVD<00:00:38.980> but

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
image you might be able to use a DVD but

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.459 
image you might be able to use a DVD but
personally<00:00:40.059> I<00:00:40.149> suggest<00:00:40.600> using<00:00:40.750> an<00:00:40.989> external

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
personally I suggest using an external

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.319 
personally I suggest using an external
hard<00:00:41.620> drive<00:00:41.679> so<00:00:42.399> it's<00:00:42.640> going<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.789> find<00:00:43.030> this

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
hard drive so it's going to find this

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.410 
hard drive so it's going to find this
and<00:00:43.629> then<00:00:44.170> just<00:00:44.199> go<00:00:44.649> next<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.269> see

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
and then just go next and you can see

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.270 
and then just go next and you can see
here<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.750> backs<00:00:46.960> up<00:00:47.140> every<00:00:47.559> partition<00:00:47.949> it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
here it backs up every partition it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.579 
here it backs up every partition it
backs<00:00:48.429> them<00:00:48.609> up<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.789> separate<00:00:49.210> VHD<00:00:49.719> files<00:00:49.989> but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
backs them up to separate VHD files but

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.200 
backs them up to separate VHD files but
it<00:00:50.710> still<00:00:50.949> backs<00:00:51.160> up<00:00:51.370> everything<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:51.879> I

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
it still backs up everything so I

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.149 
it still backs up everything so I
suggest<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.870> do<00:00:52.929> this<00:00:53.079> on<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.289> new<00:00:53.530> computer<00:00:53.739> if

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
suggest you do this on a new computer if

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.439 
suggest you do this on a new computer if
you're<00:00:54.280> building<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.699> system<00:00:54.879> image<00:00:55.269> for

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
you're building a system image for

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.329 
you're building a system image for
distribution<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.469> that<00:00:56.499> it'll<00:00:56.829> take<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.129> lot

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
distribution so that it'll take a lot

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.939 
distribution so that it'll take a lot
less<00:00:57.489> time<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.760> backup<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.170> let's<00:00:59.530> get<00:00:59.620> started

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
less time to backup so let's get started

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.790 
less time to backup so let's get started
now<00:01:00.659> this<00:01:01.659> process<00:01:01.899> should<00:01:02.289> take<00:01:02.350> probably

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
now this process should take probably

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.070 
now this process should take probably
about<00:01:02.980> 30<00:01:03.339> minutes<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:04.449> can<00:01:04.600> take<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.780> lot<00:01:05.019> more

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
about 30 minutes it can take a lot more

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.870 
about 30 minutes it can take a lot more
a<00:01:05.290> lot<00:01:05.620> less<00:01:05.860> depending<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.340> how<00:01:06.460> big<00:01:06.670> your

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
a lot less depending on how big your

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.539 
a lot less depending on how big your
images<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:07.750> you're<00:01:07.869> creating<00:01:08.079> but<00:01:08.890> I'm

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
images that you're creating but I'm

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.590 
images that you're creating but I'm
going<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.759> pause<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.090> video<00:01:10.149> here<00:01:10.570> and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
going to pause the video here and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.749 
going to pause the video here and
alrighty<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:11.979> looks<00:01:12.130> like<00:01:12.280> it's<00:01:12.430> done<00:01:12.579> its

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
alrighty so it looks like it's done its

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.670 
alrighty so it looks like it's done its
job<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.329> it's<00:01:13.840> asking<00:01:13.990> me<00:01:14.200> here<00:01:14.320> if<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.470> want<00:01:14.619> to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
job and it's asking me here if I want to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.200 
job and it's asking me here if I want to
make<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.799> system<00:01:15.220> repair<00:01:15.340> disc<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:15.909> just<00:01:16.090> going

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
make a system repair disc I'm just going

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.639 
make a system repair disc I'm just going
to<00:01:16.299> click<00:01:16.450> no<00:01:16.659> for<00:01:16.689> now<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.049> can<00:01:17.320> do<00:01:17.409> that<00:01:17.530> if

this<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.790> close<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.360> now<00:03:27.540> you

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
this so you can close this out now you

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.479 
this so you can close this out now you
can<00:03:28.049> see<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.320> exclude<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> stuff<00:03:29.310> but

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
can see it exclude all the stuff but

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.180 
can see it exclude all the stuff but
close<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.820> out<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.320> close<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:32.040> out

Jamie<00:03:36.090> Jack's<00:03:36.390> has<00:03:36.570> now<00:03:36.720> created<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:38.280> wim

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
Jamie Jack's has now created this wim

Jamie Jack's has now created this wim

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
file here which if you look and right

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.470

there<00:03:43.500> salvation<00:03:44.010> PC<00:03:44.310> dot<00:03:44.459> win<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.239> that'll

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
there salvation PC dot win so that'll

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.240 
there salvation PC dot win so that'll
actually<00:03:45.600> fit<00:03:45.959> on<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.110> 4<00:03:46.320> gigabyte<00:03:46.709> flash<00:03:46.890> drive

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
actually fit on a 4 gigabyte flash drive

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.740 
actually fit on a 4 gigabyte flash drive
because<00:03:47.519> we<00:03:47.640> use<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.910> maximum<00:03:48.360> compression

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
because we use that maximum compression

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.020 
because we use that maximum compression
rate<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> took<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.829> little<00:03:50.040> bit<00:03:50.220> longer<00:03:50.280> but

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
rate so it took a little bit longer but

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.270 
rate so it took a little bit longer but
it<00:03:51.299> makes<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.720> considerably<00:03:52.019> smaller<00:03:52.590> usually

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
it makes it considerably smaller usually

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
it makes it considerably smaller usually
I<00:03:53.310> find<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.730> it'll<00:03:53.880> make<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.239> about<00:03:54.450> 40<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.410> 45

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I find that it'll make it about 40 to 45

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.430 
I find that it'll make it about 40 to 45
percent<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.790> size<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.420> original<00:03:57.930> hard

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
percent of the size of the original hard

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.840 
percent of the size of the original hard
drive<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.010> use<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> maximum

drive when you use a maximum
oppression<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.320> might<00:04:01.500> help<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.770> out<00:04:01.860> in
