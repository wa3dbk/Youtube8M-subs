00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hi everyone Shimura included 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.010
 In once this time to say that to-5 this year 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.340
 While reviewing the Toka Fair this year that 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 Oh dear 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.630
 The most splendid I mean in my Contributors had 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.500
 Was the issue well received 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.380
 Because Smile Pretty Cure's Gacha Gaea Series 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.190
 Oh dear 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.550
 This time 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:34.040
 Nde was also Toka Tan Lily is quite swollen 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.040
 I would like to tighten the Smile Pretty Cure videos 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.810
 If you do something like this, you will be able to open it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.650
 That's why the little kid came to be able to open easily 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.740
 Ketchen this year the end of chattering is 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 Princess Sally was 32 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.130
 Come on! 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 Hmm 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.170
 Anyway I can do anything 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.170
 Let's keep going 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.470
 8 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.470
 Suma Yui is Ultra Pretty Cure Swing 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.840
 It was like this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 2 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.090
 Yes good for this place 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.409
 Oh I'd think to shoot and kill in this maybe 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.130
 aklo 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.600
 This back of my head is now Japanese Sancha 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 It is a side of the jam hair 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.630
 It looks like this 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.860
 I know there was a pretty lot of things to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.860
 It is the first time this year to post videos 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.010
 It was There are many something 's it, for example, 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010
 Hmmm 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.420
 It is also a magnet of Sailor Moon 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.660
 I posted it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.129
 I will 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:51.480
 It's open, I think this is the most shocking thing about this candy 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.460
 For example, it is a tea animation 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.950
 Somewhat scope 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.990
 I do not know why 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.710
 There are a lot of great number of plays a 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.710
 Something after 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:14.190
 Something terribly at its Oh Seung-hwan's say 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 The I say hmm is amazing ferocious wind of evaluation and after such as in Mr. try really at a low valuation 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:28.470
 Rough thought it would be what I'd bought that would looking back the videos even in the flame or 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:31.140
 I was able to identify what was in the middle of the child's face, I guess it was disgusting and the contents were uncomfortable 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.569
 I think a little bit 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.810
 I would why such great you hear 4 And because great is I voice I came 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:46.120
 Also there a little but is what also still 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:50.069
 Even if I think I softening Do not interesting at many get to see of the people was no evaluation so glad 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.069
 I'm still accepting the evaluation 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.750
 Say 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.750
 It is very cute to live in this product 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.350
 Well I think was evaluated say what or after 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.480
 pane 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.480
 It is likely Datte guy Deco Rudekoru 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.610
 What 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.670
 I rode immediately 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.510
 there were 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.510
 This is also true 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.090
 But this you have to keep it in a cardboard something 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:25.620
 For example , it would have been reset with two stops just before 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.480
 I think I will probably use it when I become a primary school student 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.450
 For now 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.450
 I will not keep it put away Daitai cardboard 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.760
 After all various boots in this one year 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.660
 Say to Toka or bought but because my sister was sleeping 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.590
 Sports 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.190
 It's funny I say not somehow going to collect this kind of wood 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.600
 Hmm 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.980
 Maji ま あ I will collect various goods from next year and then I will post the video and trigger 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.440
 This me 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:05.120
 Collect lots of toys 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:08.710
 It was a great reference for the people who posted the video of the toy 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:14.210
 So I 'm also posting that great 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.650
 I 'm continuing to post the video, thinking that someone would be helpful 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.870
 So 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.800
 Such or going to buy is someone of reference 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:31.330
 What do you say 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.330
 I think that it is good if it becomes an opportunity to decide, I will try to do it from now on 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:42.860
 I think I'll do it again next year because I'm still pounding 9 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.700
 Thank you so much for coming to expect next year and really for the whole year 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.460

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.479
