 taken into account, and televisions from Sony from the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 905 series a very high line 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.000
 this is the 47 inch much arguing let's 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's see what he has at home 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 what strikes you first is that this one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 TV very tight and rights 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.519
 knows design which means that in principle 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.630
 can find 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.189
 The great thing about the 905 series is that it 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 is LED television 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.730
 and LED televisions use how little 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 power this tv even has a monkey plus 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.340
 spoon are used every year really 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 very little power this television is over 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.850
 compared to its little brother the 805 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.789
 improved on a number of points 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.670
 That's how the 800 motionflow knows Hertz 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.890
 400 pounds on the 805 and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.110
 this TV has trilo on through technology 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 border and pink technique ensures that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 your formula and a wider color spectrum 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 hand so your colors are more intense and you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.070
 colors you can have more gradations 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 displayed that causes you to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 get a much more intense experience when you watch TV 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.119
 and especially watching HD TV and movies 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.890
