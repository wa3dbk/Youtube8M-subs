00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
hits the bug now there is some force

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.890 
hits the bug now there is some force
behind<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.240> you<00:03:14.330> get<00:03:14.450> really<00:03:14.660> close

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
behind it so if you get really close

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.680 
behind it so if you get really close
with<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.260> thing<00:03:16.210> there's<00:03:17.210> some<00:03:17.450> force

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
with this thing there's some force

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.420 
with this thing there's some force
behind<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.230> will<00:03:18.590> knock<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.010> shit<00:03:19.040> out

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
behind it that will knock the shit out

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.280 
behind it that will knock the shit out
of<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.610> fly<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> salt<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.900> contact

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
of the fly but the salt on contact

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.140 
of the fly but the salt on contact
killed<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:22.490> like<00:03:22.640> two<00:03:22.910> feet
