00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 Hey 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.580
 when choosing a motorcycle 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.580
 to take the road always generates the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.460
 question which style is best suited to 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.440
 costs and a foreign one but opens 3 can 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
 come close to perfection and why not 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.370
 a sport-touring like protection 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.520
 aerodynamics by lowering the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.480
 wind and the wii

 [Music] 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.190
 that's why we're here six hours from 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.340
 Our morning out of the publishing house our idea is 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.079
 run for over ten hours there and 13 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.840
 styles and three motorcycles are 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.680
 reference within each fat boy style 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.420
 raia lusa and gs 1200 any your motorcycle 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 we will know in the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:16.180
 practice what each one offers though

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.310
 the first stop of our adventure and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.620
 I could see that at the expense you are a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.870
 limited mobility of the show 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.729
 I can not lift the bank impact 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.830
 my leg , it too forward then 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.560
 You will have to take a little more in hand 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.920
 mostly everyone thinks 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.750
 which is uncomfortable but if you know 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.780
 using your posture the right way will be 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.480
 much more comfortable holds up here 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.670
 your weight on the leg and abdomen leave the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560
 much freer arm with impact 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 Can you absorb that energy? 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000
 is always here absorbing then 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 pressure is here not only has its 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 you think you can get much better 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
 and energy 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.080
 Now the comfort of the fairing is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.050
 going very well on the road in question 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.580
 comfort and shelter training as well 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.709
 quite now with 11 apg to train 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.130
 Her posture think it's the middle ground 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.200
 here the bank is very soft and mainly 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.150
 the suspension she has a course 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.180
 much greater then immediate understanding 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.519
 a hole is super smooth and until the return 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 it comes back in a much softer way 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.299
 much slower and elane than that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.100
 whipped at the time the 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.530
 her dynamic iron is fantastic 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.900
 until now is going very well it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.700
 hayabusa radio and also just that it was not 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.950
 a short ride still has eight hours 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.820
 ahead'm already already well with other 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.820
 impressions and leave

 [Music] 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.739
 made a rather wrong prediction of people 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.750
 meeting more than nine hours has 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.870
 playing with the front but three hours 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.819
 for more then exit be a bit of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.890
 Morning will come back at night she learns 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.890

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.270
 We're arriving at the end of the day. 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.710
 enough with the three bikes 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.710
 each has a characteristic 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.139
 completely different from the other 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.780
 I like not thinking of anything, just get the 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.969
 road is the radio but I have gone more courses 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.830
 do not have so much autonomy rescues a little 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.629
 But you want some more. 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.840
 sportsmanship with very 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.569
 the hayabusa course out of 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.909
 House, you do not know where you are. 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.219
 will decide at the time when a mountain 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.969
 thus being able to descend to the coast 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.969
 do whatever you want 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:37.250
 [Music] 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.540
 Look at this place, I think it's very 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.120
 trip for all bikes but it's a place 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.270
 I always came here to see the sunset. 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.270
 Sun 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.910
 [Music] 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.499
 ae 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.590
 already ran more than 12 hours now 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.539
 I spent the time coming back to SÃ£o Paulo. 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.750
 another hour and a half there for us 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.729
 to go to hayabusa is comfortable but 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.909
 after the excess we feel a little 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.780
 the arm a little neck in the position a 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.340
 harley 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.250
 now that he wants to return in a 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.349
 played only we saw that it is not the beach 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.330
 her to accompany the other bikes she does not 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.389
 It's the same rhythm, who's with her? 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.699
 always walking the limit what can 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:48.539
 in the curve it has a much higher limit 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:51.719
 below the others and bm like all 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.900
 the letters if you want to get the bike to 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:56.190
 It's the same good, I'll be back in Brazil, I'll go 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.860
 leave Brazil 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.990
 hence you have an upgrade is comfort time 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.159
 stitching suspension and protection 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.409
 aerodynamics 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:07.620
 let another 1 hour and ready we will 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.759
 do about 14 hours there next 14 hours 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.759
 thanks
