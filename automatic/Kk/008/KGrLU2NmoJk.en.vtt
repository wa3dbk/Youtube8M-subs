00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.380 
vehicles so forth
one<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.430> races<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.940> we're<00:00:18.060> doing

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
one of the first races that we're doing

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
one of the first races that we're doing
you're<00:00:18.510> gonna<00:00:18.600> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.619> raft

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
you're gonna want to get in this raft

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.670 
you're gonna want to get in this raft
and<00:00:20.279> there's<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> shuttle<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.300> there

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
and there's just a shuttle down there

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
and there's just a shuttle down there
and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.369> bunch<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.119> my

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and I think I do a bunch of this on my

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
and I think I do a bunch of this on my
own<00:00:24.269> because<00:00:24.539> scar<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
own because scar is it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.370 
own because scar is it
it<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.939> helps<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.260> you're

it just helps it if you like if you're

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.480 
it just helps it if you like if you're
playing<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.740> player<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.160> split-screen

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
races can get in the way so do the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799

both<00:01:52.840> these<00:01:53.049> vehicles<00:01:53.320> if<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.340> or<00:01:54.670> if<00:01:54.700> you

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
both these vehicles if you can or if you

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.240 
both these vehicles if you can or if you
want<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.380> you're<00:01:56.500> gonna<00:01:56.590> need<00:01:56.799> once<00:01:57.009> at<00:01:57.219> a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
want to but you're gonna need once at a

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
want to but you're gonna need once at a
race

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
race

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.359 
race
this<00:01:59.530> race<00:01:59.829> is<00:01:59.979> pretty<00:02:00.250> easy<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:02.250> small<00:02:03.250> of

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
this race is pretty easy it's small of

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.430 
this race is pretty easy it's small of
the<00:02:03.460> snugs<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:06.429> probably<00:02:06.789> but<00:02:07.240> that

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the snugs and it's probably but that

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.220 
the snugs and it's probably but that
probably<00:02:08.440> best<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:09.009> destroy<00:02:09.190> all<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
probably best to destroy all of the

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.600 
probably best to destroy all of the
rocks<00:02:11.230> just<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.860> they<00:02:11.980> don't<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.250> your<00:02:12.459> wave

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
rocks just so they don't get your wave

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:26.640 
rocks just so they don't get your wave
but<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> bomb<00:02:25.900> characters<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.470> can

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
but one of the bomb characters you can

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.650 
but one of the bomb characters you can
get<00:02:26.799> if<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:26.980> somehow<00:02:27.730> don't<00:02:28.060> get<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.299> bazooka

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
get if you somehow don't get the bazooka

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
by this guy and just so you know I will

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.840 
by this guy and just so you know I will
not<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:51.000> showing<00:02:51.240> us<00:02:51.480> buying<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.040> breaks<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
not be showing us buying the breaks the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.370 
not be showing us buying the breaks the
difference<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> power<00:02:55.050> bricks

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
difference I like the power bricks

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.490 
difference I like the power bricks
because<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:56.120> really<00:02:57.120> shouldn't<00:02:57.420> need<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.050> video

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
because it really shouldn't need a video

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.790 
because it really shouldn't need a video
for<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.480> I<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.140> we'll<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.500> sure

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
for that and I don't think we'll be sure

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.160 
for that and I don't think we'll be sure
and<00:03:02.040> no<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:03.989> be

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and no I don't think we will not be

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.320 
and no I don't think we will not be
showing<00:03:04.530> videos<00:03:04.980> how<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.489> get<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.880> true

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
then when I they really needed to work

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.759 
then when I they really needed to work
on<00:03:51.090> these<00:03:51.239> races<00:03:51.720> unless<00:03:52.049> they<00:03:52.230> intentionally

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
on these races unless they intentionally

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.310 
on these races unless they intentionally
made<00:03:53.280> them<00:03:53.459> horrible<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.600> would<00:03:54.750> be

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
made them horrible just so it would be

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.220 
made them horrible just so it would be
hard<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.070> just<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.209> had<00:03:57.299> time<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.959> heard

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
hard and just I had time but I heard

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.080 
hard and just I had time but I heard
about<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.709> anyway<00:03:59.070> well<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.549> true<00:03:59.700> adventures

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
get those sub multipliers and it will

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.310 
get those sub multipliers and it will
make<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.519> go<00:04:02.760> by<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.390> much<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.780> her<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.170> you

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
make it go by so much for her and you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.810 
make it go by so much for her and you
shouldn't<00:04:04.680> need<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.799> guide<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.610> just

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
shouldn't need a guide because it's just

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.640 
shouldn't need a guide because it's just
they're<00:04:06.150> playing<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.600> less<00:04:06.989> than<00:04:07.019> half<00:04:07.320> of

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
they're playing like less than half of

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.319 
they're playing like less than half of
the<00:04:07.769> level<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.430> that's<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:13.730> but<00:04:14.730> yeah<00:04:14.880> for

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
the level and that's just but yeah for

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.819 
the level and that's just but yeah for
these<00:04:15.450> races<00:04:15.600> it's<00:04:16.019> best<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> kind<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> go<00:04:16.769> slow

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
these races it's best to kind of go slow

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.199 
these races it's best to kind of go slow
to<00:04:17.160> syria<00:04:17.640> going<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.329> you'll<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:18.630> it

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
to syria going and you'll get it

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.070 
to syria going and you'll get it

the<00:04:24.790> pipeline<00:04:25.390> race<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.050> then<00:04:26.170> we've

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
the pipeline race and then we've

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.590 
the pipeline race and then we've
collected<00:04:26.980> everything<00:04:27.370> up<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.120> then<00:04:28.330> after

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
it's a parachute off in one place and

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.399 
it's a parachute off in one place and
takes<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:55.000> up<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.389> others<00:05:55.720> this<00:05:55.900> is<00:05:55.960> like<00:05:56.229> oh

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
really then we got one more and this

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.379 
really then we got one more and this
would<00:06:01.930> be<00:06:02.080> -<00:06:02.259> echo<00:06:04.289> which<00:06:05.289> honestly<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:06.120> do<00:06:07.120> not

and the only achievements that I think

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.850

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
I'm gonna have to solely make videos for

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.269 
I'm gonna have to solely make videos for
are<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.690> Creator<00:06:37.690> levels<00:06:38.080> and<00:06:38.409> the<00:06:38.800> like<00:06:39.099> that

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279 
are the Creator levels and the like that

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.529 
are the Creator levels and the like that
user<00:06:39.490> designer<00:06:39.969> levels<00:06:40.360> and<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:41.219> time<00:06:42.539> level

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
user designer levels and the time level

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.839 
user designer levels and the time level
so<00:06:43.630> we<00:06:43.719> have<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:43.900> make<00:06:44.080> beat<00:06:44.919> the<00:06:45.069> level<00:06:45.759> a

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849 
so we have to make beat the level a

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.820 
so we have to make beat the level a
certain<00:06:46.090> amount<00:06:46.270> of<00:06:46.300> time<00:06:46.509> but<00:06:46.900> other<00:06:47.650> than

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
certain amount of time but other than

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.129 
certain amount of time but other than
