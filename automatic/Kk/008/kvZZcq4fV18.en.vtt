00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
 seven goals in the benito villamarín in 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.099
 the first leg of the sixteenth 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.780
 end of the king's cup until 04 se 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.900
 came to put the almeria 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.639
 it was coming very early to finally 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.180
 point was to tie the betis first 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.279
 goal of the minute 3 match and mané gets 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.590
 the first goal for the team 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.420
 Francisco 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.840
 claim in lack at the beginning of the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.110
 played by betis players 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.390
 a foul that is pointed out to the referee 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.490
 the play goes on and goes ahead 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.630
 but it 's that two minutes later in the 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.930
 5 minute the Thai ctera without doing the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.930
 0-2 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.900
 a disastrous start of match for the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.090
 local set for the betis there was no 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.670
 out of play in a heads up 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.700
 thai got his first goal this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.700
 season 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 and the Almeria did not stay there since the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.840
 29 minute before the half hour of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.580
 party got 03 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.210
 and that finished off that combed ball in the 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.210
 first post 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.360
 Many people started to leave 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.030
 Benito Villamarín at half an hour 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 match 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.290
 there were still a lot of things 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.909
 happen at the beginning of the second half 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.900
 in the first action of danger perquis 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.549
 sends the ball head to the crossbar 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.799
 The Betis pardoned the first goal and 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.150
 Almería made the room playing with 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.580
 spaces and going to have good chances 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.060
 of the set of francisco édgar de 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.640
 head got 0-4 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.619
 the tie seemed more than resolved 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.799
 with four goals at home but 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.400
 I was still the best to come on the 14th 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.440
 he did rubén castro 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.810
 practically it was not celebrated by the betis 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.780
 while he was making up the marker 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.850
 at minute 80 however the last 10 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.250
 minutes were going to be absolutely 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.590
 frantic marked the almeria but both 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 he did not go up to the score he celebrated the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.560
 Almeria set an action that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.240
 the referee canceled 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.689
 where there does not seem to be or lack 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.420
 neither again out of the game so much 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.130
 went up to the scoreboard and immediately afterwards 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 action on the ball stopped Perquis scored the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 24 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 and now already in the last minutes when 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.270
 the betis seemed to react find 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.280
 a punch that I had not had during 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.700
 The whole game 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.340
 but he got the 2 to 4 jorge molina iba 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.140
 to have in his boots the third a pass 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.080
 by rubén castro the ball is loose in 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.850
 the small area is not finished by anyone and the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.690
 own mill in another corner kick 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.000
 I got the final 3 to 4 madness 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.430
 in Benito Villamarín a match one 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 eliminatory that was more than resolved 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 and that however 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 leave a 34 after the latter 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.920
 at which time the Almeria 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.370
 I found with the post 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.739
 eliminatory of a final 34 gives a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.120
 clear advantage to almería but leaves very 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.120
 I live to be more to betis
