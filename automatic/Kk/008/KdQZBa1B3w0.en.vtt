to be certain databases you need to get

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.180 
to be certain databases you need to get
and<00:00:15.089> they<00:00:16.049> come<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.410> two<00:00:16.500> cycles<00:00:16.949> each

every 56 days and you can usually which
will<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.349> you'll<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
will do is you'll get them from the

power it back on and on initialization

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
power it back on and on initialization
it<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.470> recognize<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> fact<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.579> there's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it will recognize the fact that there's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.380 
it will recognize the fact that there's
a<00:01:30.090> new<00:01:30.390> file<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.140> ask<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:32.299> do<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a new file and it will ask you do you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
a new file and it will ask you do you
want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> install<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.439> new<00:01:34.470> file<00:01:34.770> you'll<00:01:35.009> tell

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
want to install the new file you'll tell

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
want to install the new file you'll tell
it<00:01:35.220> yes<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.360> through<00:01:36.570> its<00:01:36.750> whole

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it yes it will go through its whole

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130 
it yes it will go through its whole
setup<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:38.390> can't<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
setup I can't do that here on the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.889 
setup I can't do that here on the
simulator<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:41.240> obviously<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.750> no

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
simulator because obviously there's no

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.170 
simulator because obviously there's no
way<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.290> take<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.680> cards<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
way for me to take these cards out but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
way for me to take these cards out but
what<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.600> show<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> looks

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
what I can show you is what it looks

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.120 
what I can show you is what it looks
like<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.460> power<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.360> unit<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> let's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
like when we power up the unit so let's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.319 
like when we power up the unit so let's
give<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.579> shot<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.180> see

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
give that a shot and here we can see

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
give that a shot and here we can see
it's<00:01:54.479> initializing<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.680> through

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's initializing and it's going through

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's initializing and it's going through

understanding<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.800> flying

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
understanding is that if you're flying

understanding is that if you're flying
IFR<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.030> when<00:02:59.239> these<00:02:59.840> databases

IFR and this is when these databases
become<00:03:00.830> supercritical<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:03.590> can<00:03:03.860> fly<00:03:04.130> with<00:03:04.160> an

become supercritical you can fly with an

responsibility to have a source of data
that<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.450> up-to-date<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.320> maybe<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.769> have

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
that is up-to-date so maybe you have

in that case only you can continue to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.890 
you can see that there's some terrain
that<00:04:04.489> are<00:04:04.610> obstacles<00:04:05.030> here<00:04:05.360> because<00:04:05.630> we're<00:04:05.780> at

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
that are obstacles here because we're at

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.740 
that are obstacles here because we're at
a<00:04:05.930> low<00:04:06.170> altitude<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.950> it's<00:04:07.130> warning<00:04:07.459> us<00:04:07.750> so

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
a low altitude so it's warning us so

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.400 
a low altitude so it's warning us so
that's<00:04:08.930> all<00:04:09.140> there<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:10.120> the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.490 

aspects<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.730> databases<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.690> hopefully

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
aspects of the databases and hopefully

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500 
aspects of the databases and hopefully
every<00:04:17.040> time<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.400> turn<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:17.670> the<00:04:17.970> unit<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.360> you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
every time you turn on the unit and you

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.750 
every time you turn on the unit and you
see<00:04:18.690> those<00:04:18.870> things<00:04:19.170> scrolling<00:04:19.620> by<00:04:19.800> it's<00:04:20.489> not<00:04:20.730> a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
see those things scrolling by it's not a

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.880 
see those things scrolling by it's not a
mystery<00:04:21.239> as<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.420> what's<00:04:21.720> going<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.200> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
mystery as to what's going on you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.380 
mystery as to what's going on you
understand<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.670> it's<00:04:23.850> loading<00:04:24.300> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
understand that it's loading the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.930 
understand that it's loading the
databases<00:04:25.050> from<00:04:25.290> those<00:04:25.470> SD<00:04:25.830> cards<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.400> it's

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
databases from those SD cards and it's

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.600 
databases from those SD cards and it's
verifying<00:04:27.540> them<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.020> telling<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.770> what's

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
verifying them and telling you what's

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.790 
verifying them and telling you what's
going<00:04:29.940> on<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.900> that's<00:04:30.990> all<00:04:31.200> there<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.650> it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
going on so that's all there is to it

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.680 
going on so that's all there is to it
it's<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.160> simple<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.730> once<00:04:33.210> again<00:04:33.360> I'm

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
it's that simple and once again I'm

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.290 
it's that simple and once again I'm
using<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.140> Garmin<00:04:34.560> g1000<00:04:35.250> trainer<00:04:35.490> which<00:04:36.180> you

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
using the Garmin g1000 trainer which you

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.640 
using the Garmin g1000 trainer which you
can<00:04:36.450> download<00:04:36.600> from<00:04:36.960> their<00:04:37.140> website<00:04:37.500> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
can download from their website and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
can download from their website and
believe<00:04:37.860> it's<00:04:38.010> 30<00:04:38.130> bucks<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:39.060> highly

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
believe it's 30 bucks and I highly

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.960 
believe it's 30 bucks and I highly
recommend<00:04:39.420> it
