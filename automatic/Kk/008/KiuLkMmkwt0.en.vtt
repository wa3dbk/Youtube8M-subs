motors they do have a flaw and the flaw
is<00:00:15.830> they<00:00:16.830> did<00:00:17.070> cam<00:00:17.550> chain<00:00:17.880> tensioners<00:00:18.480> back<00:00:18.750> in

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
is they did cam chain tensioners back in

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.420 
is they did cam chain tensioners back in
two<00:00:19.859> thousand<00:00:21.199> actually<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:23.930> 1999<00:00:25.130> up<00:00:26.130> to

2006 and the flaw the problem was the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.959 
2006 and the flaw the problem was the
cam<00:00:30.420> chain<00:00:30.449> tensioners<00:00:31.279> between<00:00:32.279> 2030

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
of them and if you're right down to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
of them and if you're right down to
where<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> scary<00:01:07.830> point<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.909> need

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
where they're at the scary point we need

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
where they're at the scary point we need
to<00:01:09.150> address<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.200> didn't<00:01:10.500> need<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to address that we didn't need to do a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300 
to address that we didn't need to do a
gear-driven<00:01:11.340> system<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.380> motorcycle<00:01:14.100> or

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
gear-driven system in your motorcycle or

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.179 
gear-driven system in your motorcycle or
replace<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.630> tensioners<00:01:16.140> probably<00:01:17.040> nine

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
replace your tensioners probably nine

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
replace your tensioners probably nine
out<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> ten<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> gear<00:01:19.320> driven

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
out of ten we do go to the gear driven

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
out of ten we do go to the gear driven
system<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.670> bomb<00:01:21.000> proof<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.540> mean

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
system because it's bomb proof I mean

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
system because it's bomb proof I mean
you'll<00:01:21.869> never<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> problem<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.250> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you'll never have a problem with this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
you'll never have a problem with this
okay<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.380> preventative<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.830> important

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
okay so preventative is more important

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
okay so preventative is more important
than<00:01:26.430> letting<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:27.000> until<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> engine<00:01:27.750> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
than letting it go until the engine is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
than letting it go until the engine is
blown<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.409> cost<00:01:28.650> savings<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> huge<00:01:29.460> there

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
blown because cost savings is huge there

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
blown because cost savings is huge there
I'm<00:01:29.820> sure<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.720> there's<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.619> these<00:01:31.770> ones<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
I'm sure so there's are these ones that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'm sure so there's are these ones that
you've<00:01:32.310> worked<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.790> save<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.390> show

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you've worked on you save them and show

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
you've worked on you save them and show
what<00:01:33.630> you've<00:01:33.780> done<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.110> 29,000<00:01:34.979> miles<00:01:35.100> yeah

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
what you've done at 29,000 miles yeah

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
what you've done at 29,000 miles yeah
we've<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.450> we've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> tupperware<00:01:37.290> full

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
we've well we've got a tupperware full

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
we've well we've got a tupperware full
we<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.829> started<00:01:38.159> saving<00:01:38.369> those<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.299> summer

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
we just started saving those this summer

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
we just started saving those this summer
we<00:01:39.630> probably<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:40.140> 20<00:01:40.500> sets<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.250> cam

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
we probably have 20 sets of the cam

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.670 
we probably have 20 sets of the cam
chain<00:01:42.270> tensioners<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.590> one

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
chain tensioners there there's one

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490 
chain tensioners there there's one
that's<00:01:44.009> broken<00:01:44.189> completely<00:01:44.820> off<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.420> guy<00:01:45.659> he

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's broken completely off this guy he

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
that's broken completely off this guy he
couldn't<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.890> gone<00:01:46.979> another<00:01:47.280> 10<00:01:47.970> miles<00:01:48.240> or

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
couldn't have gone another 10 miles or

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
couldn't have gone another 10 miles or
he<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.409> had<00:01:49.560> metal<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> metal<00:01:50.189> which

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
he would have had metal to metal which

let's check these out and see if they're
still<00:02:07.380> good<00:02:07.890> or<00:02:08.129> need<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.610> replaced<00:02:08.879> we

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
still good or need to be replaced we

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.320 
still good or need to be replaced we
have<00:02:09.420> seen<00:02:09.720> some<00:02:10.020> go<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:11.099> 30<00:02:11.459> maybe<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.150> much

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
have seen some go over 30 maybe as much

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.580 
have seen some go over 30 maybe as much
as<00:02:12.390> 40<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.080> very

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
as 40 but very

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
as 40 but very
them<00:02:13.800> we've<00:02:14.220> taken<00:02:14.489> some<00:02:14.760> apart<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.269> are<00:02:15.360> 20

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
them we've taken some apart that are 20

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.500 
them we've taken some apart that are 20
25<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.800> didn't<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.489> another<00:02:17.700> 500<00:02:18.300> miles

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
25 that didn't have another 500 miles

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.509 
25 that didn't have another 500 miles
left<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> huge<00:02:19.890> thing<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.370> be

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
left on so this is a huge thing to be

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.460 
left on so this is a huge thing to be
aware<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.790> right<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:21.330> solutely<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> love

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
aware of right now solutely and I love

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.170 
aware of right now solutely and I love
this<00:02:22.739> example<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
this example here that you have that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
this example here that you have that
people<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.599> look<00:02:24.780> at<00:02:24.959> when<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.140> come<00:02:25.440> up

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
people can look at when they come up

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
people can look at when they come up
because<00:02:25.950> they<00:02:26.069> can<00:02:26.250> see<00:02:26.280> where<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.819> going<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
because they can see where it's going to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.339 
because they can see where it's going to
be<00:02:27.060> replaced<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.720> say<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.019> chain<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
be replaced when you say the chain and

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.400 
be replaced when you say the chain and
that<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.940> gear<00:02:30.180> driven<00:02:30.360> makes<00:02:30.840> perfect

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that or the gear driven makes perfect

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.869 
that or the gear driven makes perfect
sense<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.830> you're<00:02:32.099> never<00:02:32.519> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.819> have

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
sense because you're never going to have

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.330 
sense because you're never going to have
an<00:02:33.239> issue<00:02:33.390> again<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.860> nice<00:02:35.040> time

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
an issue again on and it's a nice time

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
an issue again on and it's a nice time
too<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.940> you're<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.720> into<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
too if you're going to get into that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.410 
too if you're going to get into that
part<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.530> your<00:02:37.590> motor<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.790> rest<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.269> twin
