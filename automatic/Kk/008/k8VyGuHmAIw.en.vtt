through<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.459> pattern<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.530> then<00:03:50.889> you<00:03:50.920> switch

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
through this pattern and then you switch

through this pattern and then you switch
your<00:03:52.060> left<00:03:52.239> hand<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.620> then<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.950> breathe

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
your left hand and then you breathe

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.590 
your left hand and then you breathe
relax<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.280> keep<00:03:57.459> thinking<00:03:57.700> right<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> back

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
relax and keep thinking right the back

relax and keep thinking right the back
of<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.780> head<00:03:58.959> past<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.620> ear<00:03:59.859> nose<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:01.120> the

you guys don't mind me of this left up

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.790 
you guys don't mind me of this left up
right<00:04:22.370> down<00:04:22.520> okay<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> one<00:04:24.110> going<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:24.500> goes

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
right down okay so the one going up goes

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.350 
right down okay so the one going up goes
to<00:04:24.979> back<00:04:25.190> your<00:04:25.490> head<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:25.970> going<00:04:26.330> down

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
to back your head the one going down

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.060 
to back your head the one going down
went<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.960> front<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.500> they<00:04:27.740> get<00:04:27.889> there<00:04:28.010> at

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
went to the front and they get there at

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.770 
went to the front and they get there at
the<00:04:28.130> same<00:04:28.310> time<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:28.940> they<00:04:29.030> don't<00:04:29.210> go<00:04:29.389> core

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
the same time so they don't go core

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.290 
the same time so they don't go core
clunker<00:04:30.320> clunk<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:31.370> try<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.639> have<00:04:31.820> symmetry

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
clunker clunk you try to have symmetry

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.840 
clunker clunk you try to have symmetry
so<00:04:32.780> they<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.199> head<00:04:33.350> together<00:04:33.860> they

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
so they get to the head together they

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.870 
so they get to the head together they
both<00:04:35.180> go<00:04:35.479> past<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.050> ears<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.550> till<00:04:37.760> they've

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
both go past the ears so till they've

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.659 
both go past the ears so till they've
switched<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.660> then<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.590> extend<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.550> you

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
switched and then you extend and you

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.270 
switched and then you extend and you
can't<00:04:41.000> extend<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.900> way<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:43.010> one<00:04:43.160> at<00:04:43.220> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
can't extend this way the one at the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.950 
can't extend this way the one at the
back<00:04:43.400> your<00:04:43.639> hand<00:04:43.820> cannot<00:04:44.150> extend<00:04:44.510> down<00:04:44.750> so

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
back your hand cannot extend down so

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.150 
back your hand cannot extend down so
they're<00:04:45.080> confused<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.650> think<00:04:45.830> well<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.070> can

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
they're confused to think well it can

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.550 
they're confused to think well it can
only<00:04:46.400> go<00:04:46.669> up<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:47.570> one<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:47.750> front<00:04:48.020> can<00:04:48.229> go<00:04:48.380> down

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
only go up the one in front can go down

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.520 
only go up the one in front can go down
you<00:04:49.310> go<00:04:49.430> through<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.669> big<00:04:49.789> circle<00:04:50.229> back<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.440> the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
you go through a big circle back to the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.990 
you go through a big circle back to the
head<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.860> repeat<00:04:52.720> open<00:04:53.949> circle<00:04:54.949> get<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.880> the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
head and repeat open circle get to the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.180 
head and repeat open circle get to the
head<00:04:56.210> repeat<00:04:57.110> again<00:04:57.710> if<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:57.949> let<00:04:58.100> your

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
head repeat again if you let your

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.700 
head repeat again if you let your
posture<00:04:58.699> go<00:04:58.820> at<00:04:58.940> all<00:04:59.120> you'll<00:04:59.510> end<00:04:59.840> up<00:05:00.020> here<00:05:00.380> or

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
posture go at all you'll end up here or

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.680 
posture go at all you'll end up here or
something<00:05:01.070> it'll<00:05:01.430> start<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.699> fall<00:05:01.850> apart<00:05:01.970> it's

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
something it'll start to fall apart it's

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.930 
something it'll start to fall apart it's
a<00:05:02.720> really<00:05:02.990> good<00:05:03.110> posture<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.729> one<00:05:04.850> that

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
a really good posture and the one that

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.540 
a really good posture and the one that
goes<00:05:05.060> up<00:05:05.360> one<00:05:06.139> going<00:05:06.410> down<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.949> can't<00:05:07.190> go

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
goes up one going down it can't go

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.310 
goes up one going down it can't go
behind<00:05:07.699> you<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.090> keep<00:05:08.330> circling<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.199> one

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
behind you and keep circling so the one

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.890 
behind you and keep circling so the one
going<00:05:09.500> up<00:05:09.710> gets<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.039> back<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.400> head<00:05:10.900> both

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
going up gets the back of the head both

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.779 
going up gets the back of the head both
past<00:05:12.199> the<00:05:12.350> ears<00:05:12.530> Vijay<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:14.260> open<00:05:15.639> if<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:16.760> have

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
past the ears Vijay and open if you have

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.129 
past the ears Vijay and open if you have
any<00:05:16.940> trouble<00:05:17.240> just<00:05:17.300> go<00:05:17.510> back<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.750> one<00:05:17.870> hand<00:05:18.050> at

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
any trouble just go back to one hand at

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.450 
any trouble just go back to one hand at
a<00:05:18.199> time<00:05:18.229> it'll<00:05:18.590> make<00:05:18.680> sense<00:05:18.830> it's<00:05:19.370> just

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
a time it'll make sense it's just

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.360 
a time it'll make sense it's just
building<00:05:19.699> muscle<00:05:20.090> memory<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:21.110> once<00:05:22.099> you<00:05:22.250> get

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
building muscle memory and once you get

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.860 
building muscle memory and once you get
the<00:05:22.490> basic<00:05:22.880> pattern<00:05:23.300> going<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:23.750> start

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
the basic pattern going you start

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.450 
the basic pattern going you start
thinking<00:05:24.320> of<00:05:24.410> all<00:05:24.620> your<00:05:24.889> lines<00:05:25.039> and

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
thinking of all your lines and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.580 
thinking of all your lines and
symmetries<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.210> posture<00:05:26.599> so<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.260> when<00:05:27.500> you

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
symmetries and posture so that when you

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.980 
symmetries and posture so that when you
open<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.099> extend<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.360> get<00:05:29.510> those<00:05:29.660> focus

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
open you extend and you get those focus

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.450 
open you extend and you get those focus
points<00:05:30.320> all<00:05:30.770> right<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.949> haven't<00:05:31.099> extended

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
points all right you haven't extended

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.760 
points all right you haven't extended
here<00:05:31.849> you've<00:05:32.090> extended<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.539> here<00:05:32.840> man<00:05:33.620> so

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
here you've extended to here man so

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.200 
here you've extended to here man so
you're<00:05:33.919> hitting<00:05:34.039> the<00:05:34.220> both<00:05:34.460> focus<00:05:34.880> point<00:05:35.120> so

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210
