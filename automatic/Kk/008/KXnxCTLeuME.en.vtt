a taxonomist is in a nutshell as someone

a taxonomist is in a nutshell as someone
who<00:00:16.590> describes<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.609> classifies<00:00:18.240> a

biological group in my case plants but

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
biological group in my case plants but
to<00:00:24.480> me<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.019> much<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:27.830> when

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to me it's so much more than that when

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.030 
to me it's so much more than that when
I'm<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.550> looking<00:00:29.760> down<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> microscope

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
I'm when I'm looking down a microscope

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400 
I'm when I'm looking down a microscope
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.690> amazing<00:00:33.690> moment<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you can get that amazing moment when you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.930 
you can get that amazing moment when you
suddenly<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> structure<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> you've

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
suddenly see a structure that you've

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.780 
suddenly see a structure that you've
never<00:00:36.090> seen<00:00:36.420> before<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.800> Eureka<00:00:38.129> moment

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
never seen before or that Eureka moment

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
never seen before or that Eureka moment
when<00:00:39.000> you're<00:00:39.270> looking<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.750> specimens<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
when you're looking at specimens and you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
when you're looking at specimens and you
suddenly<00:00:40.860> realize<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.700> suddenly<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.360> how

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
suddenly realize you suddenly see how

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
suddenly realize you suddenly see how
the<00:00:42.960> pattern<00:00:43.260> fits<00:00:43.739> together<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the pattern fits together and you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
the pattern fits together and you
understand<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.180> they're<00:00:45.360> related<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> each

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
understand how they're related to each

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
understand how they're related to each
other<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.739> exciting<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.489> something

life that we have on this planet because
the<00:01:02.130> world<00:01:02.370> itself<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.890> unimaginably
