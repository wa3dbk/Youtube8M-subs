off put a new blade on it and pretty

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.260 
off put a new blade on it and pretty
sure<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> bearing<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> blade<00:00:56.370> goes<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
sure the bearing the blade goes on is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
sure the bearing the blade goes on is
probably<00:00:57.780> bad<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> matter<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> fate<00:00:58.739> replace

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

that<00:01:00.079> paint<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:03.470> luckily<00:01:04.470> most<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that paint it out luckily most of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.000 
that paint it out luckily most of the
lettering<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.229> okay<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

out<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> pulley<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
out what it is is it's a pulley that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.830 
out what it is is it's a pulley that
like<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> deck<00:01:43.229> tips<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.399> something<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
like when the deck tips or something the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840 
like when the deck tips or something the
pulley<00:01:46.110> rubs<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.680> another<00:01:47.009> pulley<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
pulley rubs on another pulley and it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240 
pulley rubs on another pulley and it
doesn't<00:01:48.659> meet<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> break<00:01:49.439> cue<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.130> I'll

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
doesn't meet up on a break cue here I'll

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:06.969 
doesn't meet up on a break cue here I'll
show<00:01:50.490> you

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.609 

so<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.130> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> figure<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.729> out<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.619> get

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
so I'm going to figure that out and get

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.300 
so I'm going to figure that out and get
that<00:02:10.770> fixed

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that fixed

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.130
