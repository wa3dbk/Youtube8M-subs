you<00:00:02.669> with<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.820> weekly<00:00:03.149> rust<00:00:03.389> update<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:04.080> and

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
you with a weekly rust update video and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.930 
you with a weekly rust update video and
boy<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.830> big<00:00:05.069> one<00:00:05.220> so<00:00:05.430> let's<00:00:05.580> get<00:00:05.790> right

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
boy is this a big one so let's get right

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.639 
boy is this a big one so let's get right
into<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.750> most<00:00:06.960> exciting<00:00:07.379> part<00:00:07.589> about

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
into it the most exciting part about

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.379 
into it the most exciting part about
this<00:00:07.890> week's<00:00:08.130> update<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.670> blue<00:00:08.910> table<00:00:09.300> in

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
this week's update is this blue table in

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.600 
this week's update is this blue table in
front<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.660> us<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> research<00:00:11.040> table<00:00:11.460> guys

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
front of us it is a research table guys

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.549 
front of us it is a research table guys
it's<00:00:11.969> akin<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> research<00:00:12.960> kits<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.380> used

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it's akin to the research kits that used

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.200 
it's akin to the research kits that used
to<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> legacy<00:00:14.219> if<00:00:14.400> you've<00:00:14.549> played<00:00:14.759> legacy

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
to be a legacy if you've played legacy

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
to be a legacy if you've played legacy
but<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> means<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.039> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
but really what this means for you is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.859 
but really what this means for you is
that<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.119> an<00:00:18.240> item<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.690> want

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that if you find an item that you want

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
that if you find an item that you want
to<00:00:18.930> research<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.189> actually<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.550> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
to research you can actually use this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
to research you can actually use this
table<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.470> potentially<00:00:22.470> acquire<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> blueprint

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
table to potentially acquire a blueprint

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.099 
table to potentially acquire a blueprint
for<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> item<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> default

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
for the item so it is a default

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.839 
for the item so it is a default
blueprint<00:00:25.560> guys<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.730> your

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
blueprint guys so when you go to your

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.750 
blueprint guys so when you go to your
crafting<00:00:27.300> menu<00:00:27.420> you'll<00:00:27.720> notice<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
crafting menu you'll notice that the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.460 
crafting menu you'll notice that the
research<00:00:29.760> kit<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> actually<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.869> your<00:00:31.140> default

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
research kit is actually in your default

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
research kit is actually in your default
blueprints<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.640> ahead<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.880> take<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
blueprints if you go ahead and take a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
blueprints if you go ahead and take a
look<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.230> called<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> research

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
look at it and it's called a research

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.030 
look at it and it's called a research
table<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.610> costs<00:00:36.120> 1500<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.899> 1000<00:00:37.860> metal

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
table it costs 1500 would 1000 metal

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
table it costs 1500 would 1000 metal
fragments<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> repair

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
fragments and you have to have a repair

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.470 
fragments and you have to have a repair
bench<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> resources<00:00:42.360> for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
bench as well and so the resources for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
bench as well and so the resources for
the<00:00:42.540> repair<00:00:42.840> bench<00:00:43.020> would<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.260> an<00:00:43.320> additional

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the repair bench would be an additional

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000 
the repair bench would be an additional
500<00:00:43.890> wood<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> 1000<00:00:45.450> fragments<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.500> that's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
500 wood and 1000 fragments so that's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
500 wood and 1000 fragments so that's
what's<00:00:47.219> needed<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.550> craft<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
what's needed to craft it so if you

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
what's needed to craft it so if you
craft<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> item<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> research

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
craft the item and you want to research

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
craft the item and you want to research
something<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.510> instance<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.110> try<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
something for instance will try to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
something for instance will try to
research<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> c-4<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.820> drag<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> into

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
research the c-4 here will drag it into

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
research the c-4 here will drag it into
the<00:00:54.600> research<00:00:54.870> table<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.920> tells<00:00:56.100> us<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the research table and it tells us that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.279 
the research table and it tells us that
we<00:00:56.520> need<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.030> resources<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.050> would<00:00:58.170> need

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
we need the resources that we would need

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
we need the resources that we would need
to<00:00:58.469> make<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.190> explosives<00:00:59.760> itself<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to make the explosives itself just to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
to make the explosives itself just to
research<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> thirty<00:01:02.309> percent

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
research it and is a thirty percent

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
research it and is a thirty percent
chance<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.329> success<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.500> we'll<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.739> ahead<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
chance of success so we'll go ahead and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
chance of success so we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:01:05.010> try<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> research<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.080> takes

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
we'll try to research that and it takes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
we'll try to research that and it takes
about<00:01:07.350> 10<00:01:07.710> seconds<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.939> you'll

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
about 10 seconds to do so so you'll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.490 
about 10 seconds to do so so you'll
notice<00:01:09.390> there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> timer<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
notice there's a timer on that it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
notice there's a timer on that it's
counting<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.430> guys<00:01:12.420> these<00:01:12.689> numbers<00:01:13.049> are

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
counting down and guys these numbers are

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.510 
counting down and guys these numbers are
likely<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.650> tweaked<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
likely going to be tweaked but this is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.380 
likely going to be tweaked but this is
the<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> looks<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.030> failed

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the way it looks right now so we failed

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
the way it looks right now so we failed
to<00:01:18.509> research<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> item<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.740> heard<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> break

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
to research that item we heard it break

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.999 
to research that item we heard it break
and<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.630> item<00:01:21.960> guys<00:01:22.140> has<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> chance<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> either

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and the item guys has a chance of either

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
and the item guys has a chance of either
breaking<00:01:23.340> completely<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> did<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
breaking completely what you did in this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
breaking completely what you did in this
case<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> zero

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
case or it can go down to zero

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
case or it can go down to zero
durability<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:27.240> lost<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> c4<00:01:27.930> charge<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
durability we lost that c4 charge that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
durability we lost that c4 charge that
was<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> risky<00:01:29.220> move<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:30.119> try<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.390> again<00:01:30.479> we

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
was a risky move let's try it again we

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
was a risky move let's try it again we
have<00:01:30.990> enough<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> try<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.189> attempt

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
have enough to try one more attempt

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
have enough to try one more attempt
again<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> thirty<00:01:34.020> percent<00:01:34.380> success<00:01:34.770> rate

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
again it's a thirty percent success rate

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
again it's a thirty percent success rate
so<00:01:35.939> we'll<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.180> ahead<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.360> we'll<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.750> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so we'll go ahead and we'll see if we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
so we'll go ahead and we'll see if we
make<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:37.799> around<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> research

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
make it this time around now to research

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
make it this time around now to research
the<00:01:41.460> item<00:01:41.700> guys<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.060> does<00:01:42.210> cost<00:01:42.450> 10<00:01:42.810> paper<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the item guys it does cost 10 paper the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
the item guys it does cost 10 paper the
resources<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> item<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
resources you need for the item and you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.929 
resources you need for the item and you
need<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> item<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
need to have the item as well so it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
need to have the item as well so it
looks<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.659> actually<00:01:48.960> acquired

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
looks like in here we actually acquired

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
looks like in here we actually acquired
a<00:01:49.649> blueprint<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> item<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.090> now

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a blueprint for the item so we can now

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
a blueprint for the item so we can now
go<00:01:51.360> ahead<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> study<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> blueprint

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
go ahead and we can study that blueprint

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.749 
go ahead and we can study that blueprint
we've<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.520> learned<00:01:53.729> c4<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.079> good<00:01:55.320> stuff<00:01:55.759> next

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we've now learned c4 so good stuff next

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
we've now learned c4 so good stuff next
up<00:01:56.880> guys<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.659> you'll<00:01:58.200> notice<00:01:58.469> I'm

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
up guys we have you'll notice I'm

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
up guys we have you'll notice I'm
holding<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> new<00:01:59.490> addition<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> game

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
holding here a new addition to the game

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.800 
holding here a new addition to the game
it's<00:02:01.200> called<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.890> custom<00:02:02.369> SMG<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's called the custom SMG or the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.160 
it's called the custom SMG or the
submachine<00:02:04.170> gun<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.590> looks<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
submachine gun it looks kind of like a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
submachine gun it looks kind of like a
grease<00:02:07.170> gun<00:02:07.200> from<00:02:07.619> World<00:02:08.069> War<00:02:08.160> 2<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.610> something

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
grease gun from World War 2 or something

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.070 
grease gun from World War 2 or something
to<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> effect<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.720> worry<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to that effect but don't worry if you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
to that effect but don't worry if you
like<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> tops<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> Thompson<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.489> still

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
like the tops and the Thompson is still

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
like the tops and the Thompson is still
in<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> game<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> difference<00:02:13.680> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
in the game what is the difference we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.300 
in the game what is the difference we
doing<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> two<00:02:14.220> guns<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:15.420> new<00:02:16.310> submachine

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
doing the two guns the new submachine

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.870 
doing the two guns the new submachine
gun<00:02:17.460> holds<00:02:17.700> 24<00:02:18.120> rounds<00:02:18.630> whereas<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.200> Thompson

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
gun holds 24 rounds whereas the Thompson

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.790 
gun holds 24 rounds whereas the Thompson
holds<00:02:20.880> 20<00:02:21.270> rounds<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:22.080> that's<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.440> biggest

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
holds 20 rounds so that's the biggest

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.500 
holds 20 rounds so that's the biggest
differences<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.490> terms<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> rounds<00:02:24.210> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
differences in terms of the rounds the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
differences in terms of the rounds the
rate<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> fire<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.050> different<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.710> well<00:02:25.860> we'll

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
rate of fire is different as well we'll

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
rate of fire is different as well we'll
go<00:02:26.520> ahead<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.730> compare<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.540> fire<00:02:27.870> off

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
go ahead and compare it will fire off

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.860 
go ahead and compare it will fire off
the<00:02:28.110> Thompson<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.860> all<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.190> love

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the Thompson that we all know and love

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.730 
the Thompson that we all know and love
and<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:30.990> we'll<00:02:31.080> go<00:02:31.140> ahead<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.320> take<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> look

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and then we'll go ahead and take a look

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060 
and then we'll go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> new<00:02:32.040> custom<00:02:32.490> submachine<00:02:32.970> gun<00:02:34.070> much

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
at the new custom submachine gun much

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.780 
at the new custom submachine gun much
quicker<00:02:35.400> much<00:02:36.240> snappier<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> said

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
quicker much snappier and like I said

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.340 
quicker much snappier and like I said
it's<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> grease<00:02:39.900> gun<00:02:39.930> I'm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it's more of a kind of a grease gun I'm

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.540 
it's more of a kind of a grease gun I'm
sure<00:02:40.530> there's<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.830> difference<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> range

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
sure there's a difference with the range

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.040 
sure there's a difference with the range
and<00:02:41.730> we'll<00:02:41.880> go<00:02:42.000> ahead<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> more<00:02:42.540> more

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and we'll go ahead and do a more more

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.590 
and we'll go ahead and do a more more
thorough<00:02:43.350> test<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:45.180> bit<00:02:45.360> later

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
thorough test on that a little bit later

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.570 
thorough test on that a little bit later
guys<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.350> difference<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.830> terms<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.130> crafting

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
guys the difference in terms of crafting

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.860 
guys the difference in terms of crafting
the<00:02:47.670> items<00:02:48.000> if<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.300> go<00:02:48.390> ahead<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.720> take<00:02:48.840> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the items if you go ahead and take a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.310 
the items if you go ahead and take a
look<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:50.490> submachine<00:02:50.940> gun<00:02:51.320> cost

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
look at it the submachine gun cost

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.590 
look at it the submachine gun cost
standard<00:02:52.739> metal<00:02:52.890> fragments<00:02:53.489> 100<00:02:54.090> wouldn't<00:02:54.420> n

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
standard metal fragments 100 wouldn't n

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.260 
standard metal fragments 100 wouldn't n
cloth<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.290> Thompson<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.160> 350<00:02:56.850> metal

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270

cloth and the Thompson is 350 metal
fragments<00:02:57.720> 100<00:02:58.200> would<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.590> no<00:02:58.800> cloth<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
fragments 100 would and no cloth so the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.180 
fragments 100 would and no cloth so the
SMG<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:01.050> little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.770> resource

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
SMG is a little bit more resource

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.090 
SMG is a little bit more resource
intensive<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:03.000> some<00:03:03.870> ways<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.920> pretty

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
intensive in some ways it's a pretty

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.680 
intensive in some ways it's a pretty

the line of the aesthetic that rust is
going<00:03:20.580> for<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.180> really<00:03:21.360> cool<00:03:21.630> stuff<00:03:21.840> it's

going for so it's really cool stuff it's

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.530 
going for so it's really cool stuff it's
very<00:03:22.799> inaccurate<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.970> prone<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.239> not

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
going to work so we'll go ahead and test

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.270 
going to work so we'll go ahead and test
out<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> few<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.120> them<00:03:30.269> guys<00:03:31.170> also<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:32.070> aware

the grenades in this patch have been

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.840 
the grenades in this patch have been
buffed<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.500> little<00:03:34.709> bit<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.100> grenade

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
buffed a little bit so that grenade

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.520 
buffed a little bit so that grenade
damage<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.360> said<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.600> be<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:37.230> thirty

and<00:03:39.360> those<00:03:39.870> guys<00:03:40.049> usually<00:03:40.380> are<00:03:40.739> spot-on<00:03:41.130> with

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
and those guys usually are spot-on with

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.949 
and those guys usually are spot-on with
their<00:03:41.549> information<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.360> we'll<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.780> ahead<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
their information so we'll go ahead and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.600 
their information so we'll go ahead and
test<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.410> will<00:03:43.590> lob<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.950> being<00:03:44.130> hand<00:03:44.370> grenade

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
test it will lob of being hand grenade

test it will lob of being hand grenade
inside<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.330> wooden<00:03:45.600> area<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:45.989> see<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.290> it

you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.560> go<00:04:22.710> ahead<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.039> make<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.910> map<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.360> the

you can go ahead and make a map of the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.029 
you can go ahead and make a map of the
world<00:04:24.479> around<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.169> sort<00:04:25.349> of<00:04:25.470> plot<00:04:25.650> points

of<00:04:26.130> interest<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.729> it's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
of interest and it's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.820 
of interest and it's
pretty<00:04:27.419> cool<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:27.690> way<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.930> works<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.319> you<00:04:28.379> put

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
pretty cool the way it works so you put

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.830 
pretty cool the way it works so you put
it<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:28.979> your<00:04:29.009> hotbar<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.580> hit<00:04:29.759> G<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.449> has<00:04:30.599> a<00:04:30.629> bit

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
it in your hotbar you hit G it has a bit

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.779 
it in your hotbar you hit G it has a bit

out the horse walls are said to have
increased<00:05:26.099> by<00:05:26.580> about<00:05:26.729> twenty<00:05:27.270> percent<00:05:27.300> with

this<00:05:27.900> week's<00:05:28.080> patch<00:05:28.289> I'm<00:05:28.590> not<00:05:28.740> sure<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:28.919> I

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
this week's patch I'm not sure that I

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.070 
this week's patch I'm not sure that I
can<00:05:29.099> tell<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.460> difference<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.449> by<00:05:30.719> doing<00:05:30.780> so

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
can tell the difference but by doing so

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.230 
can tell the difference but by doing so
it's<00:05:31.349> definitely<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.800> increase<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.520> ability

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
it's definitely to increase the ability

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.390 
it's definitely to increase the ability
to<00:05:33.630> shoot<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.900> horse<00:05:34.169> for<00:05:34.590> food<00:05:34.770> but<00:05:35.279> I'm

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
to shoot the horse for food but I'm

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.610 
to shoot the horse for food but I'm
hoping<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.699> it<00:05:35.909> was<00:05:36.029> done<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.779> allow<00:05:37.349> players

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
hoping that it was done to allow players

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.260 
hoping that it was done to allow players
to<00:05:37.740> ride<00:05:38.009> horses<00:05:38.219> in<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.580> future<00:05:38.849> hoping<00:05:39.180> it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
to ride horses in the future hoping it

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.420 
to ride horses in the future hoping it
was<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.419> step<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:39.659> that<00:05:39.779> direction<00:05:39.919> so<00:05:40.919> any<00:05:41.190> rate

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
was a step in that direction so any rate

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.700 
was a step in that direction so any rate
guy<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.669> good<00:05:42.029> stuff<00:05:42.270> really<00:05:43.259> hope<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.560> guys
