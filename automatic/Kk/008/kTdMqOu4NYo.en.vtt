have<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.730> might<00:00:32.910> come<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.120> handy<00:00:33.210> later

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
have that it might come in handy later

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569

worried<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> would<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.950> able<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> set<00:02:08.369> up

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
worried that it would be able to set up

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.650 
worried that it would be able to set up
on<00:02:08.610> me<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:08.819> something<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.239> i<00:02:09.300> decided<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
on me or something so i decided to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.340 
on me or something so i decided to
paralyze<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.110> i<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.440> had<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> feeling

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
help out for later on and it kind of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770 
help out for later on and it kind of
does<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.000> not<00:02:16.060> as<00:02:16.390> much<00:02:16.540> as<00:02:16.600> i

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
does a little bit but not as much as i

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.620 
does a little bit but not as much as i
would<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:16.930> liked<00:02:17.170> um<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.300> bring<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.420> since

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
would have liked um I bring in since

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.180 
would have liked um I bring in since
we're<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:19.900> because<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.380> he<00:02:20.890> probably

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
we're here because I think he probably

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.740 
we're here because I think he probably
doesn't<00:02:21.550> have<00:02:21.640> fire<00:02:21.820> punch<00:02:22.120> or<00:02:22.300> flamethrower

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
doesn't have fire punch or flamethrower

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.320 
doesn't have fire punch or flamethrower
so<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.650> might<00:02:23.920> try<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.250> set<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.580> here<00:02:24.760> he<00:02:25.180> gets

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
so I might try and set up here he gets

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.150 
so I might try and set up here he gets
paralyzed<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.960> turn<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.770> don't<00:02:27.100> know

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
paralyzed that turn but I don't know

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.380 
paralyzed that turn but I don't know
what<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.370> would<00:02:27.490> have<00:02:27.520> gone<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.210> went

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
what you would have gone for if you went

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
what you would have gone for if you went
for<00:02:28.510> an<00:02:28.600> aqua<00:02:28.840> tail<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.260> turn<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
for an aqua tail on that turn like you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.220 
for an aqua tail on that turn like you
see<00:02:30.940> here<00:02:30.970> definitely<00:02:31.600> would<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:31.930> been<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
see here definitely would have been to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.570 
see here definitely would have been to
pick<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.560> 0<00:02:32.590> which<00:02:32.890> means<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.220> would<00:02:33.400> not<00:02:33.550> have

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
pick a 0 which means I would not have

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.070 
pick a 0 which means I would not have
gotten<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:34.000> sword<00:02:34.330> stance<00:02:34.540> up<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.960> would

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
gotten my sword stance up and I would

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.770 
gotten my sword stance up and I would
have<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.620> uh<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:37.450> for<00:02:37.630> like<00:02:37.720> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
have had to just uh go for like a

superpower or something but um either

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.050 
superpower or something but um either
way<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.250> wouldn't<00:02:42.430> really<00:02:42.550> matter<00:02:42.670> because

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
way it wouldn't really matter because

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.480 
way it wouldn't really matter because
his<00:02:43.600> Infernape<00:02:44.440> as<00:02:44.560> Mach<00:02:44.770> punch<00:02:45.040> meaning<00:02:45.400> that

alright<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:51.580> at<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.930> point<00:02:52.990> his

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
alright because at this point his

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.500 
alright because at this point his
infernape<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.160> low<00:02:54.310> enough<00:02:54.430> from<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:54.970> life

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
infernape is low enough from like life

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.840 
infernape is low enough from like life
