sills booster XL but i use that with all
of<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:47.970> mascaras<00:01:48.509> lately<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.070> think

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
of my mascaras lately so i don't think

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.039 
of my mascaras lately so i don't think
that<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> making<00:01:51.420> any<00:01:51.570> dramatic

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that that is making any dramatic

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
that that is making any dramatic
difference<00:01:52.770> why<00:01:53.729> mean<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> does<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.720> meaning

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
difference why mean it does but meaning

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.039 
difference why mean it does but meaning
so<00:01:55.820> making<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.360> any<00:01:57.540> differently<00:01:57.960> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so making me think any differently of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.620 
so making me think any differently of
this<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:59.070> i<00:01:59.430> use<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.360> different

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this because i use it with all different

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.480 
this because i use it with all different
types<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.829> results<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
types and get the same results from that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
types and get the same results from that
product<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
product but i really think this is a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
product but i really think this is a
nice<00:02:04.860> mascara<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:05.670> only<00:02:05.909> downside<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> i
