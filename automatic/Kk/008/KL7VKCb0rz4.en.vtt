 do not get upset or angry 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.649
 from a person who did not thank you 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.099
 dumping as a way of repaying 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.099
 nor take back the team 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.760
 these students 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.269
 the writer confirms 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.579

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770
 and it's no use repeating 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.870
 give it a go 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.870
 as long as it is with the heart 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.740
 it's Sunday prayer 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.090
 called our father 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.870

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.259

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.439
 and lead us not into temptation 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.439
 we got distracted from evil 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.279
 if the techniques 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.279
 Jesus and the apostles went to a desert region 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.339
 fame is also on the big field 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.559

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.559
 concerned about the resources questioning decisions 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.909
 see sir 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.860
 For three days, all these people have been with us and have nothing to eat. 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.490
 it's best to send the people to get closer in order to get food 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.509
 natural disasters 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.610

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.009
 and some fish 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.289
 hide the face 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.729
 Jesus considering the disciples that he participated with me in three persons 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.339
 in the semester tens of thousands of people 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.510
 and the parents and the fish barely gave us 4 as one of the disciples 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.379
 How cool are you? 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.729

 bill clinton hillary that multiplication happened on that 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.939
 time 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.849
 the disciples were distributing pieces of cloth and let the people 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:39.860
 and the food was multiplying 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.490
 everyone could cover the funk 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.289
 until they are satisfied
