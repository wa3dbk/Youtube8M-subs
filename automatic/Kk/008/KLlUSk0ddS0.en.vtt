00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.860
 today we are going to learn the preparation of a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.710
 different recipe that combines a lot of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 with the juninas is the corn cake and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 peanut 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 Who's going to teach us how to do this? 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.650
 delight is the owner of the whole only learned to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 her mother-in-law had a nickname 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 It's different to kill hunger because it's your 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 recipe plataform she is actually she 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.620
 did because she had seven sons men 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 They really liked to eat bread then. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.290
 I would eat them a lot of bread then it is time for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.110
 so she made this cake that he 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.390
 besides being a cake he can do it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 I thought you would need a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.410
 cup of milk a cup of cream 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.699
 fresh three eggs a cup of flour 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.300
 wheat 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.300
 a cup of ground roasted peanuts 2 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.940
 cups brown sugar 1 cup 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.390
 yellow smoke and a spoonful of yeast 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 in web forums it is very simple to prepare 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.880
 the scene begins beating the clear in snow 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.880
 yes first we are going to hit the egg 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.400
 And now we're going to mix the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.400
 Brown sugar 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.440
 add 3 egg yolks and fresh cream 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.130
 put the milk into flour and the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.340
 Yellow corn was a ground peanut and 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 roast at the end place the yeast in 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 powder and beat until the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.890
 now it's ready now now we're already 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.460
 we hit him 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.280
 We'll put it and we'll put it in the 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.080
 smeared and is a way to escape. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 that can make a shape 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.120
 round normal square 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.840
 The one and only now. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 Now we're going to take the oven to 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:44.080
 shape was in the middle of the cake will bake by 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.310
 about 35 minutes and is ready great 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.300
 still in the back since I think 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.300
 It will be the game.
