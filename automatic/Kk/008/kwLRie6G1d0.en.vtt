to<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.580> little<00:00:08.910> bit<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> confusion<00:00:09.450> between

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
to be a little bit of confusion between

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.709 
to be a little bit of confusion between
the<00:00:10.500> two<00:00:10.620> models<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.580> that's<00:00:11.730> why<00:00:11.940> today<00:00:12.210> I'm

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the two models so that's why today I'm

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.120 
the two models so that's why today I'm
going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.139> highlighting<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> differences

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
going to be highlighting the differences

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.939 
going to be highlighting the differences
between<00:00:14.639> both<00:00:15.269> iphones<00:00:15.859> commencing<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
between both iphones commencing the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.190 
between both iphones commencing the
intro<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.310> loud

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.050 

let's<00:00:25.710> begin<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.100> the<00:00:26.340> most<00:00:26.370> obvious

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
let's begin with the most obvious

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.880 
let's begin with the most obvious
difference<00:00:27.090> between<00:00:27.900> these<00:00:27.990> two<00:00:28.050> iphones<00:00:28.620> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
difference between these two iphones and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.960 
difference between these two iphones and
that<00:00:29.280> is<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.760> size<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.900> iphone<00:00:31.290> 6<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.970> 4.7

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
that is the size the iphone 6 has a 4.7

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.330 
that is the size the iphone 6 has a 4.7
inch<00:00:33.090> display<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.810> the<00:00:33.840> iphone<00:00:34.470> 6<00:00:34.710> plus<00:00:34.830> has<00:00:35.310> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
inch display and the iphone 6 plus has a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
inch display and the iphone 6 plus has a
massive<00:00:35.730> 5.5<00:00:36.600> inch<00:00:36.840> display<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.890> there's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
massive 5.5 inch display but there's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.800 
massive 5.5 inch display but there's
also<00:00:38.280> another<00:00:38.640> difference<00:00:39.330> between<00:00:39.690> these

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
also another difference between these

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.750 
also another difference between these
two<00:00:39.870> models<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> comes<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.340> display

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
two models when it comes to the display

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
two models when it comes to the display
and<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.660> resolution<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.550> iphone

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and that is the resolution so the iphone

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.390 
and that is the resolution so the iphone
6<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.630> small<00:00:45.960> model<00:00:46.380> has<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.830> displayed

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
6 the small model has a displayed

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.360 
6 the small model has a displayed
resolution<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> slightly<00:00:48.870> above<00:00:49.370> 720p

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
resolution that is slightly above 720p

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.560 
resolution that is slightly above 720p
so<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.030> 1334<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:52.200> 750<00:00:52.950> I<00:00:53.150> honestly<00:00:54.150> don't

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
so it is 1334 by 750 I honestly don't

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.570 
so it is 1334 by 750 I honestly don't
know<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:55.110> Apple<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.590> thinking<00:00:56.010> putting<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
know what Apple was thinking putting a

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.690 
know what Apple was thinking putting a
720p<00:00:57.330> display<00:00:57.630> on<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.710> iPhone<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.520> day

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
720p display on an iPhone in this day

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.820 
720p display on an iPhone in this day
and<00:00:59.730> age<00:00:59.970> but<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.810> does<00:01:01.020> give<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.380> a<00:01:01.410> pixel

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
and age but it does give you a pixel

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.030 
and age but it does give you a pixel
density<00:01:02.220> of<00:01:02.360> 326<00:01:03.360> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> decently<00:01:04.710> high

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
density of 326 which is decently high

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.760 
density of 326 which is decently high
but<00:01:05.790> once<00:01:06.060> again<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.479> only<00:01:06.750> 720p<00:01:07.200> display

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but once again it's only 720p display

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.330 
but once again it's only 720p display
well<00:01:08.550> technically<00:01:09.030> 750<00:01:09.990> p<00:01:10.170> display<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
well technically 750 p display but this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
well technically 750 p display but this
iphone<00:01:11.759> 6<00:01:12.119> definitely<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.050> have<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
iphone 6 definitely does not have the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
iphone 6 definitely does not have the
best<00:01:14.190> display<00:01:14.700> meanwhile<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.810> iphone<00:01:16.200> 6<00:01:16.470> plus

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
best display meanwhile the iphone 6 plus

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.680 
best display meanwhile the iphone 6 plus
does<00:01:17.190> have<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> small<00:01:17.940> improvement<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
does have a small improvement when it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.570 
does have a small improvement when it
comes<00:01:18.899> to<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.140> resolution<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> comes

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
comes to the resolution because it comes

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.170 
comes to the resolution because it comes
in<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.910> 1920<00:01:21.690> x<00:01:22.110> 1080<00:01:22.440> p<00:01:22.800> so<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> 1080p

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
in at 1920 x 1080 p so it's a 1080p

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.260 
in at 1920 x 1080 p so it's a 1080p
display<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.899> gives<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> pixel<00:01:25.680> density<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
display it gives you a pixel density a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.389 
display it gives you a pixel density a
401<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.810> definitely<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.220> most

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
401 which is definitely good but on most

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.120 
401 which is definitely good but on most
phones<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.270> big<00:01:30.660> 5.5<00:01:31.470> inch<00:01:31.679> display

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
phones that have a big 5.5 inch display

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.400 
phones that have a big 5.5 inch display
and<00:01:32.369> above<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.300> come<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> 2k

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
and above they all come with a 2k

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.050 
and above they all come with a 2k
display<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.429> that<00:01:35.580> means<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
display so that means it has a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.889 
display so that means it has a
resolution<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.810> 2560<00:01:37.530> x<00:01:38.069> 1440<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:39.539> once<00:01:39.720> again

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
resolution of 2560 x 1440 so once again

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.080 
resolution of 2560 x 1440 so once again
the<00:01:40.229> iphone<00:01:40.619> 6<00:01:40.950> plus<00:01:41.039> doesn't<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the iphone 6 plus doesn't have a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.779 
the iphone 6 plus doesn't have a
phenomenal<00:01:42.600> displayed<00:01:43.350> by<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.800> means<00:01:44.100> but

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
phenomenal displayed by any means but

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.199 
phenomenal displayed by any means but
1080p<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.660> good<00:01:45.929> enough<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.410> suppose<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:47.209> while

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
1080p is good enough i suppose and while

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.749 
1080p is good enough i suppose and while
on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.569> topic<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.080> size<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.979> thickness<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
on the topic of size the thickness of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.430 
on the topic of size the thickness of
the<00:01:50.880> phone<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.330> slightly<00:01:51.569> different<00:01:51.869> between

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
the phone is slightly different between

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.800 
the phone is slightly different between
the<00:01:52.740> plus<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> non<00:01:53.580> plus<00:01:53.819> model<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the plus and the non plus model so the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
the plus and the non plus model so the
base<00:01:55.020> iphone<00:01:55.500> 6<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.190> thickness<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.789> six

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
base iphone 6 has a thickness of six

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
base iphone 6 has a thickness of six
point<00:01:57.750> nine<00:01:57.810> millimeters<00:01:58.590> thick<00:01:58.860> which<00:01:59.550> is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
point nine millimeters thick which is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340
