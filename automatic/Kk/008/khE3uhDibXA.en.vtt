squeezing<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.360> hit<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:55.880> now

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
squeezing down on it as you hit it now

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.310 
squeezing down on it as you hit it now
last<00:02:57.209> ones<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:57.600> going<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.989> clean

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
last ones not going to be that clean

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.120 
last ones not going to be that clean
because<00:02:58.590> you're<00:02:58.709> really<00:02:58.890> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.070> be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
because you're really going to be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.710 
because you're really going to be
letting<00:02:59.340> go<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:02.489> your<00:03:02.640> way<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.820> bar<00:03:03.090> G<00:03:03.360> chords

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
letting go on your way to a bar G chords

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.370 
letting go on your way to a bar G chords
the<00:03:03.840> third<00:03:04.019> fret<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> bar<00:03:06.269> d7<00:03:06.959> at<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.110> fifth

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the third fret to a bar d7 at the fifth

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.920 
the third fret to a bar d7 at the fifth
so<00:03:07.800> that's<00:03:07.950> an<00:03:08.040> a7<00:03:08.370> shape<00:03:09.680> c7<00:03:10.940> at<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> third<00:03:12.300> b7

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
so that's an a7 shape c7 at the third b7

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.050 
so that's an a7 shape c7 at the third b7
at<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> second<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.220> then<00:03:14.640> we're<00:03:14.760> done<00:03:14.850> right

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
at the second and then we're done right

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.680 
at the second and then we're done right
back<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> riff<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:18.390> goes<00:03:18.540> really

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
back to the riff so here goes really

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.030 
back to the riff so here goes really
slowly<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.140> made<00:03:19.320> narrate<00:03:19.620> through<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.920> we'll

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
slowly I made narrate through it we'll

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.610 
slowly I made narrate through it we'll
see<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:21.720> taking<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.080> right<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.500> what

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
see we're taking it right from what

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:32.370 
see we're taking it right from what
would<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.160> beginning<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> singing

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:41.420 

a<00:03:37.590> seven

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.960 

like<00:03:42.430> tui<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:43.000> rift<00:03:43.209> starting<00:03:43.569> at<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.689> base

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.120 

DISA

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
DISA

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:06.869 
DISA
three<00:03:50.700> measures

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.520 

so<00:04:07.879> there<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:08.750> go<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:09.080> little<00:04:09.260> bit<00:04:09.410> more

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
so there you go a little bit more

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.920 
so there you go a little bit more
