00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.940 
some earlier installments now they're
using<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.540> brand<00:01:59.840> new<00:02:00.020> engine<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.740> game

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
using a brand new engine but the game

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620 
using a brand new engine but the game
feels<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.520> little<00:02:01.640> slower<00:02:02.030> than<00:02:02.270> some<00:02:02.480> other

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
feels a little slower than some other

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.590 
feels a little slower than some other
halos<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.230> you<00:02:03.650> don't<00:02:03.860> get<00:02:04.040> as<00:02:04.160> many<00:02:04.340> guns<00:02:04.700> you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
halos and you don't get as many guns you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840 
halos and you don't get as many guns you
can't<00:02:06.110> hold<00:02:06.350> two<00:02:06.620> guns<00:02:06.830> at<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.040> same<00:02:07.250> time<00:02:07.520> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
can't hold two guns at the same time and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.910 
can't hold two guns at the same time and
you<00:02:08.060> have<00:02:08.210> fewer<00:02:08.450> vehicles<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.230> the<00:02:09.440> game<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you have fewer vehicles in the game and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.340 
you have fewer vehicles in the game and
for<00:02:10.429> me<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> felt<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.270> was<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.290> know

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
for me it felt like it was just you know

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.030 
for me it felt like it was just you know
over<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.830> little<00:02:13.040> too<00:02:13.280> quickly<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.470> would<00:02:15.830> not

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
over a little too quickly so I would not

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.010 
over a little too quickly so I would not
say<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.760> my<00:02:16.910> favorite<00:02:17.330> halo<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
say that this is my favorite halo to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.900 
say that this is my favorite halo to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
date but they've added some stuff to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.380 
date but they've added some stuff to
make<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.300> quite<00:02:20.480> possibly<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> most<00:02:21.350> fun<00:02:22.040> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
make it quite possibly the most fun and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.660 
make it quite possibly the most fun and
