00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello my name is guy so I'm 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.280
 gardener trainer in the field of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.980
 gardening check mark 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.809
 we'll see how to prune a rosebush 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.990
 before planting it be a rosebush 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.820
 bush or a climbing rose we'll see 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.449
 how to prune watered busson before the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.330
 planting 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.119
 of course why do we first size everything 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.920
 just to link every year 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.869
 young branches that they are 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.359
 vigorous more resistant to 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.460
 diseases and of course more floriferous 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 so first we will remove the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.949
 branches that have died like this one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.839
 like this one who is dead 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.559
 now we will cut the branches that 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.449
 are in the middle so like this which 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.269
 touch another branch to get it 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.180
 delete so we'll cut above 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.369
 a bud that goes outward 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.290
 you see the slope is opposite to 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:59.890
 buds and we're going to do the same 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.059
 thing on every branch of the rose bush we 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's see as soon as a climbing roses 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.850
 of course how to prune him at the moment of 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.220
 the plantation 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.590
 of course here you will notice that the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.570
 bud is here is that this part there 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.210
 of the branch is not fed so she 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.799
 will dry it will rot it will make it a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.310
 gateway for insects and 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.759
 mushrooms 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.429
 so we're skewing just above 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.350
 of the branch that is in good health and 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:27.070
 of course just above a branch 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.049
 who goes outward to expand the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.270
 climbing rose tree you know how to plant your 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.030
 climbing rose set the branches in 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.640
 oblique on your wall in reaction the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.979
 buds that are here will grow and 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.899
 push very straight and do not forget a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.679
 branch that is right only makes the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.009
 wood and leaves 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.109
 so it will of course have to be arched you have 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.090
 prune your roses in spring they 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.219
 make flowers but the flowers do not 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.799
 and not to exhaust the plant you have to 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.679
 of course remove the faded roses 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.549
 but where to remove them you will notice that 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.759
 be your roses 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.310
 you have leaves that have a two 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.060
 three leaflets and leaves that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 have one two three four five or seven 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.200
 leaflets it will always cut at 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.600
 above a leaf that has five leaflets 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.580
 or 7 leaflets to have us 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.200
 loeffler so we removed the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 faded flowers or as during 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.650
 all season because the majority 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.080
 rosebushes bloom from May to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.480
 jellies provided you remove the flowers 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.580
 faded arrive in the fall when the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.560
 leaves are going naturally well 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.860
 sure we'll pick them up pick up 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.570
 and remove the dead branches make the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.580
 finally cleaning and removing the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.010
 last faded flowers and the true 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.480
 size will only intervene at the exit of 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.550
 winter when there will be more than 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.580
 gene risks in a few years 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.920
 in 7 to 10 years the oldest branch of 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.680
 climbing rose is going to be all wrinkled at the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.590
 base and will become a den of 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.500
 insect disease that's why 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.150
 after 7 10 made it a small 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.490
 incision at the base of the limb to 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.310
 removing a little bit of Corsican for 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.440
 to start again to make leave a 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.270
 young branch of a doctor candas 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 there we saw how to cut 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.520
 a roger bush and why and a 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.110
 rose climbing of course the majority of 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.530
 rose bushes carve out of 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.900
 Winter 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.850
 except for the roses that bloom from 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.920
 my frozen waters but we have 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.930
 some old varieties of roses 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.540
 which only blooms once at 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.030
 spring this one of course it takes them 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.340
 prune after their flowering 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.260
 otherwise you will not have flowers 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810
 now you've seen how to trim 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.700
 your roses in now this is your 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 turn to your secateurs
