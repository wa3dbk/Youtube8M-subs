which largely can be attribute to the

that<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.540> it's<00:00:49.540> fast<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:56.410> any<00:00:56.620> mode<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:57.040> feels<00:00:57.310> a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
that is it's fast in any mode it feels a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.480 
days that said the more I drive the m4
the<00:01:07.540> more<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:07.810> like<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.470> so<00:01:08.800> perhaps<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.310> just

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the more I like it so perhaps it's just

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.060 
the more I like it so perhaps it's just
a<00:01:09.580> question<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.060> acclamation<00:01:14.070> nevertheless

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
a question of acclamation nevertheless

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.310 
a question of acclamation nevertheless
it's<00:01:15.460> remarkable<00:01:15.910> how<00:01:16.119> varied<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.630> m4<00:01:17.020> can<00:01:17.229> be

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
it's remarkable how varied the m4 can be

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's remarkable how varied the m4 can be
in<00:01:17.410> terms<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.800> ride<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.790> comfortable<00:01:19.270> enough

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
in terms of ride it's comfortable enough

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.540 
in terms of ride it's comfortable enough
to<00:01:19.479> drive<00:01:19.780> them<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.229> daily<00:01:20.470> yet<00:01:20.860> powerful<00:01:21.340> and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
to drive them in daily yet powerful and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.600 
to drive them in daily yet powerful and
agile<00:01:22.060> enough<00:01:22.360> for<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> day<00:01:23.170> on<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> track

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.980 

so<00:01:27.610> yes<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.119> well<00:01:28.300> suited<00:01:28.660> in<00:01:28.780> either

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
so yes it's well suited in either
