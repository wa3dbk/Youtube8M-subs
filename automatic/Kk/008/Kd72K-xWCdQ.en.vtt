because<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.700> way<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> label<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.959> couldn't

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
because the way that is label I couldn't

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
because the way that is label I couldn't
I<00:02:52.890> couldn't<00:02:53.310> figure<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.690> not

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
I couldn't figure it I do it's not

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.280 
I couldn't figure it I do it's not
labeled<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.709> regular<00:02:55.860> boss<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
labeled like the regular boss and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.990 
labeled like the regular boss and
initially<00:02:58.290> when<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.500> got<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> draw<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.640> didn't

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
initially when I got the draw I didn't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.800 
initially when I got the draw I didn't
think<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:00.989> fit<00:03:01.260> me<00:03:01.440> around<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.879> bought<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
think it will fit me around I bought it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.009 
think it will fit me around I bought it
mainly<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:04.830> other<00:03:05.340> cup<00:03:05.849> size<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.599> knew

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
mainly because other cup size I knew

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.070 
mainly because other cup size I knew
that<00:03:07.709> if<00:03:08.010> cup<00:03:08.280> size<00:03:08.550> was<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.819> big<00:03:09.209> cup<00:03:09.510> size<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
that if cup size was a big cup size and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.410 
that if cup size was a big cup size and
I<00:03:10.200> knew<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.709> he<00:03:11.190> would<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.489> fit<00:03:11.819> whoever

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
I knew that he would have fit whoever

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.540 
I knew that he would have fit whoever
fit<00:03:12.750> around<00:03:13.080> they<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.860> full<00:03:14.159> breath

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
fit around they have to have full breath

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.809 
fit around they have to have full breath
so<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.300> purchased<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:17.250> how<00:03:17.610> much

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
so I purchased it because of how much

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.020 
so I purchased it because of how much
room<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.780> had<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> breast<00:03:19.950> area<00:03:20.190> when<00:03:21.000> I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
room it had in the breast area when I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.240 
room it had in the breast area when I
got<00:03:21.330> home<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:22.849> realized<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:25.830> broth

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
got home I realized that this broth

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.420 
got home I realized that this broth
actually<00:03:26.909> fits<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.409> tight<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.129> I'm

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
actually fits now it's tight so I'm

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
actually fits now it's tight so I'm
thinking<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.360> wearing<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:30.690> 38<00:03:31.230> I'm

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
thinking if I'm wearing a 38 I'm

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.809 
thinking if I'm wearing a 38 I'm
thinking<00:03:31.980> maybe<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:33.239> 36<00:03:34.200> I'm<00:03:35.099> daring<00:03:35.670> a

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
thinking maybe this is a 36 I'm daring a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.539 
thinking maybe this is a 36 I'm daring a
36<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.420> 38<00:03:36.900> don't<00:03:37.200> fit<00:03:37.409> me<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.860> tight<00:03:38.159> around

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
36 to 38 don't fit me this tight around

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.899 
36 to 38 don't fit me this tight around
so<00:03:39.239> I'm<00:03:39.540> thinking<00:03:39.989> it's<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.170> 36<00:03:40.680> maybe<00:03:41.099> is<00:03:41.459> an<00:03:41.670> H

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
so I'm thinking it's a 36 maybe is an H

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.050 
so I'm thinking it's a 36 maybe is an H
or<00:03:42.269> G<00:03:43.170> because<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.620> cup<00:03:44.069> size<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.670> very

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
or G because the cup size is very

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.660 
or G because the cup size is very
big<00:03:45.360> but<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> bought<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.220> because<00:03:47.489> it's

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
big but really I bought it because it's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.660 
big but really I bought it because it's
so<00:03:47.849> sturdy<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:49.110> thing<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.950> hold<00:03:50.250> up<00:03:50.459> any
