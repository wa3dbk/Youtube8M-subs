mcpe texture pack installer called quick

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
mcpe texture pack installer called quick
switch<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.350> quick<00:00:16.529> switch<00:00:16.800> does<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.369> it

using mcpe texture pack installer so the
way<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.840> been<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.260> far<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.830> still

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
way it's been so far because it's still

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.160 
way it's been so far because it's still
in<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> beta<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.810> been<00:00:27.960> so

in just a beta but the way it's been so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630 
in just a beta but the way it's been so
far<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> want<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.609> a

far is that you when you want to get a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
far is that you when you want to get a
new<00:00:29.820> texture<00:00:30.179> pack<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> with

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
new texture pack you have to get it with

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.680 
new texture pack you have to get it with
either<00:00:31.230> MCPE<00:00:31.740> mod<00:00:32.009> locator<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.669> installing<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
either MCPE mod locator or installing it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.930 
either MCPE mod locator or installing it
directly<00:00:33.989> through<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.320> app<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
directly through the app and you have to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.520 
directly through the app and you have to
wait<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> unpack<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> texture<00:00:37.350> pack

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
wait for it to unpack the texture pack

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.400 
wait for it to unpack the texture pack
put<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.399> mcpe<00:00:38.879> repack<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.750> files<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
put it into mcpe repack some files and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
put it into mcpe repack some files and
stuff<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.820> time<00:00:42.059> consuming

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
stuff like that and it's time consuming

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090 
stuff like that and it's time consuming
and<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.440> thing<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.890> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and it's one thing if you're just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
and it's one thing if you're just
installing<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> texture<00:00:44.879> pack<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.090> once<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
installing a texture pack for once and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.819 
installing a texture pack for once and
you're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> keep<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> long<00:00:46.800> time

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you're going to keep it for a long time

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.440 
you're going to keep it for a long time
but<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> those<00:00:48.030> people<00:00:48.360> who

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
but if you're one of those people who

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
but if you're one of those people who
likes<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> change<00:00:49.110> their<00:00:49.379> texture<00:00:49.710> packs<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
likes to change their texture packs on a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
likes to change their texture packs on a
regular<00:00:50.309> basis<00:00:50.910> then<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> total

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
regular basis then it can be a total

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
regular basis then it can be a total
waste<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.710> time<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
waste of time you know have to go you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
waste of time you know have to go you
have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.840> find<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> file<00:00:55.680> again<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
have to go find the file again and you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.920 
have to go find the file again and you
have<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> wait<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> stuff

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
have to wait for it to do all that stuff

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
have to wait for it to do all that stuff
over<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:58.980> again<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.609> very

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
over and over again and that can be very

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
over and over again and that can be very

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
this feature and how much more

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
this feature and how much more
beneficial<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.500> let's<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.739> ahead<00:01:04.769> and

beneficial it is so let's go ahead and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
beneficial it is so let's go ahead and
open<00:01:05.040> mcpe<00:01:05.549> mod<00:01:05.820> locator<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> does

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
open mcpe mod locator because it does

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.620 
open mcpe mod locator because it does
work<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> install<00:01:08.280> an<00:01:08.520> MCP<00:01:08.790> mod<00:01:09.150> locator

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
work when you install an MCP mod locator

texture pack let's go ahead and get
basic<00:01:12.840> shaders<00:01:13.760> download<00:01:15.590> then<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
basic shaders download then we have to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:27.300 
basic shaders download then we have to
wait<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.040> word<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> install<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.000> usual

size<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> texture<00:04:12.870> pack<00:04:13.020> itself<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:13.650> in

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
size of the texture pack itself but in

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.770 
size of the texture pack itself but in
most<00:04:14.010> cases<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.610> would<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.850> about<00:04:15.030> 13<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.630> 15

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
most cases it would be about 13 to 15

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.590 
most cases it would be about 13 to 15
megabytes<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.549> not<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.700> big<00:04:17.880> deal<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.360> think

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
megabytes so not a big deal and I think

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.720 
megabytes so not a big deal and I think
when<00:04:18.780> zero<00:04:19.739> point<00:04:19.890> eleven<00:04:20.130> point<00:04:20.310> 0<00:04:20.400> finally

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
when zero point eleven point 0 finally

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.710 
when zero point eleven point 0 finally
comes<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.030> it'd<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.450> more<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:21.660> 14<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.410> 16<00:04:23.720> but

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
comes out it'd be more like 14 to 16 but

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.120 
comes out it'd be more like 14 to 16 but
yeah<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.350> just<00:04:25.620> makes<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:25.950> much

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
yeah really this just makes it so much

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.670 
yeah really this just makes it so much
quicker<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.850> I'm<00:04:27.690> not<00:04:27.840> gonna<00:04:27.900> release<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.320> beta
