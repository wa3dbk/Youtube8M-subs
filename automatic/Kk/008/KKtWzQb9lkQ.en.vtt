 first the foil removed and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 then as you know it from beats 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.449
 Hidden is when we open the lid 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.340
 Remove then we have only one time 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.050
 piece of cardboard which we fold upwards 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 Now we will continue the packaging there 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.990
 a soft touch surface 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.460
