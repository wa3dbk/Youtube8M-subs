00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
yourself even if you have to grow a lot

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
yourself even if you have to grow a lot
slower<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.980> point<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
slower so I think that's one point and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
slower so I think that's one point and
our<00:00:56.699> goal<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.750> family<00:00:58.109> owned

way everybody makes mistakes you know

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.490 
way everybody makes mistakes you know
you<00:01:17.060> just<00:01:17.180> have<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.450> make<00:01:17.600> these<00:01:17.720> mistakes<00:01:18.320> in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
you just have to make these mistakes in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.289 
you just have to make these mistakes in
the<00:01:18.590> beginning<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.790> always<00:01:20.000> think<00:01:20.210> that

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
the beginning and I always think that

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.090 
the beginning and I always think that
businesses<00:01:20.930> are<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> lot<00:01:21.350> more<00:01:21.560> forgiving<00:01:22.070> than

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
businesses are a lot more forgiving than

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.749 
businesses are a lot more forgiving than
you<00:01:22.369> think

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
you think

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.570 
you think
because<00:01:23.450> all<00:01:23.600> businesses<00:01:24.110> make<00:01:24.290> mistakes<00:01:24.710> you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
because all businesses make mistakes you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.850 
because all businesses make mistakes you
just<00:01:25.820> do<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.149> just<00:01:26.360> make<00:01:26.479> mistakes<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.619> it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
just do you just make mistakes and it's

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.920 
just do you just make mistakes and it's
not<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.100> end<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.369> world<00:01:31.509> step<00:01:32.509> out<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.750> the
