00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:22.039
 the hello love to be welcomed and back 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.589
 My channel agetransp for you one more 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.230
 video only this time I 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.390
 I made mold a little more adult than 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.300
 you can put in environments 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.120
 outside of that covered or may 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.090
 put on the bed or in the living room 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.430
 It depends on the creativity of you and 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 So you want to know how I did it. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.600
 this cushion just keep on watching 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.420
 tutorial 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 I started by folding the fabric in half and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.469
 not to get out of the way 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.629
 always put pin tinho 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.480
 then I left a margin of two 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.449
 centimeters above and below the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.429
 left side of the video and the one for you 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.960
 then just plug the dots I always 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.730
 I do it that way to make it well 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.190
 right our mustard 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.980
 now I'm going to mark the length of our 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.170
 cushion that goes from 42 centimeters 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.430
 I'll make noises afterwards 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.460
 I'll connect the dots. 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.950
 and lastly I'll mark the width of the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.050
 our mold that will get under in five 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.440
 centimeters and I want it to be done 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.990
 so I'll make it 42 by 25 later 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.120
 to have done this is just cutting the fabric 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.400
 and we will already have a rectangle 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.700
 if you are the one of the glue in that video only 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.880
 spend all the balls here all fine 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.920
 Just the right glue, it's not okay, please. 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.200
 in this part of the team because if not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.050
 people will not be able to turn after I 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.180
 I will use seam already sewed and that the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.860
 and I put on a zipper and if you 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.960
 they want to know how to put a zipper on 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 invisible just watch this video here 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.520
 the skirt I made for you that teaches 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.710
 Just like coca zip 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.480
 After you've done that I'll put 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.220
 quite filling 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.380
 but I like it a little cuddly 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.320
 then I put enough investment but 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 points out that it does not leave very hard after 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.450
 to fill up, just close the cushion if you 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.530
 you are using glue just go 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.900
 in this shoot I even made a video 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.600
 For money, now I'm going to start 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.270
 part of the decoration I'm going to use mold 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.300
 the modcom to leave there in the blog for you 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.980
 seek to throw away tissue flaps 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.140
 mainly made of felt because people 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.000
 always ends up using it to make this guy 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.910
 decoration 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.030
 I'll go around here all around and 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.770
 always skirted the wrong side of the fabric 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.190
 give because as people are skirting 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.920
 with pen and if you circumvent the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.170
 right side the pen will appear after 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.110
 to have done that, just get some scissors 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.780
 very small with the thin point and remember 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.750
 All around, I'll do it with 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.030
 expensive colors of different fabrics both 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.430
 with the small cup mold with mold 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.170
 large quantity will depend on the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.720
 You do not say that you are 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.209
 do and now with the leaves in hand I 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.010
 I'll put the sheets in this way. 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.140
 But you can put it the way you do. 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 want depends a lot on your creativity 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.920
 and for necklace, just glue with hot glue 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.560

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.739
