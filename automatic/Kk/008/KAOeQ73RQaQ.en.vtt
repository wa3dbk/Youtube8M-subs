for rapping for shape at last year crash

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.199 
for rapping for shape at last year crash
yeah<00:02:12.269> yeah<00:02:13.109> and<00:02:13.290> these<00:02:13.379> actually<00:02:13.859> a<00:02:13.889> very

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
yeah yeah and these actually a very

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.369 
yeah yeah and these actually a very
compressible<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.659> you're<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.170> get

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
compressible so you're not going to get

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.129 
compressible so you're not going to get
any<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.489> chafing<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.120> your<00:02:18.269> arms<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.719> and

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
any kind of chafing on your arms or and

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.179 
any kind of chafing on your arms or and
it's<00:02:19.319> not<00:02:19.439> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.829> way<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.069> your

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
it's not going to get the way of your

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.890 
it's not going to get the way of your
arms<00:02:20.400> swing<00:02:20.549> it<00:02:20.730> off<00:02:20.849> right<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.450> speaking<00:02:21.780> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
arms swing it off right and speaking of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
arms swing it off right and speaking of
compression<00:02:22.469> you<00:02:22.859> can<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.189> that<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.459> is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
compression you can see that this is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.910 
compression you can see that this is
almost<00:02:24.090> built<00:02:24.359> like<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> turtle<00:02:25.170> shell<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.739> your

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
almost built like a turtle shell on your

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.030 
almost built like a turtle shell on your
back<00:02:26.129> so<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.549> very<00:02:26.760> shaped<00:02:27.209> low<00:02:27.959> profile<00:02:28.530> but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
back so it's very shaped low profile but

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
back so it's very shaped low profile but
you<00:02:29.159> also<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.700> these<00:02:29.969> load<00:02:30.359> lifter<00:02:30.719> straps

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you also have these load lifter straps

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.509 
you also have these load lifter straps
on<00:02:31.230> front<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.799> can<00:02:31.950> compress<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> even

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
on front so you can compress it even

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.420 
on front so you can compress it even
more<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.599> as<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> drink<00:02:34.139> down<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.590> your

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
more and then as you drink down you your

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.399 
more and then as you drink down you your
liquids<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:35.969> the<00:02:36.120> bladder<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.989> two<00:02:37.230> liter

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
liquids in the bladder the two liter

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.170 
liquids in the bladder the two liter
bladder<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.829> come<00:02:37.980> with<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:38.790> have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
bladder to come with it you also have

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.550 
bladder to come with it you also have
these<00:02:39.329> side<00:02:39.629> compression<00:02:39.959> straps<00:02:40.169> there's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
these side compression straps there's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000 
these side compression straps there's
actually<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> latticework<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:42.200> webbing<00:02:43.200> around

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
actually a latticework of webbing around

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.979 
actually a latticework of webbing around
the<00:02:44.189> bladder<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.419> when<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.659> pull<00:02:45.870> on

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
the bladder so that when you pull on

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.750 
the bladder so that when you pull on
these<00:02:46.139> what<00:02:46.859> we<00:02:46.950> call<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.189> bladder<00:02:47.400> control

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
these what we call the bladder control

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.270 
these what we call the bladder control
system<00:02:48.209> straps<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:49.530> latticework<00:02:49.980> we'll

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
system straps that latticework we'll

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.830 
system straps that latticework we'll
tighten<00:02:50.459> down<00:02:50.639> and<00:02:51.060> actually<00:02:51.569> force<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
tighten down and actually force the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.839 
tighten down and actually force the
liquid<00:02:52.049> up<00:02:52.650> higher<00:02:52.919> into<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.280> bladder<00:02:53.549> and

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
liquid up higher into the bladder and

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.899 
liquid up higher into the bladder and
and<00:02:54.650> carries<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.799> better<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.639> so

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
and carries it better on your back so

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.459 
and carries it better on your back so
closer<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.389> your<00:02:57.629> body<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:58.199> get<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.349> better

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
closer to your body so you get a better

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.050 
closer to your body so you get a better
center<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:58.919> gravity<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.849> want<00:03:00.000> to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
center of gravity right if you want to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.390 
center of gravity right if you want to
turn<00:03:00.209> around<00:03:00.329> we<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.319> show<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.530> true<00:03:02.099> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
turn around we can show that true so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280 
turn around we can show that true so
that's<00:03:02.609> an<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:02.909> all<00:03:03.239> internally<00:03:04.049> built

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
that's an all all internally built

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.699 
that's an all all internally built
within<00:03:04.859> just<00:03:05.400> part<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.639> the<00:03:05.699> pack<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.709> some

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
within just part of the pack and some

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.530 
within just part of the pack and some
pocketing<00:03:08.219> features<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.329> great

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
pocketing features that are really great

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.990 
pocketing features that are really great
like<00:03:10.530> Brent<00:03:10.769> mentioned<00:03:11.099> earlier<00:03:11.370> we've<00:03:11.790> built

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
like Brent mentioned earlier we've built

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.680 
like Brent mentioned earlier we've built
in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.329> installation<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
in the installation and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.170 
in the installation and
so<00:03:14.290> your<00:03:14.530> your<00:03:14.980> bladders<00:03:15.490> not<00:03:15.760> going<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.000> get

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so your your bladders not going to get

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.290 
so your your bladders not going to get
up<00:03:16.270> against<00:03:16.660> your<00:03:16.780> back<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.350> then<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.980> have
