00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.310
 Well, first of all, I say hello to 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.810
 all the Senegalese people here are two the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.880
 problem who knows who it was yesterday 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.820
 it's not a problem it's not a problem 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.249
 I know myself after the meal I 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.439
 heard people the others I was telling myself 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.839
 that it seems that you are stopping 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.089
 insults and the coach after after the 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.470
 match in senegal all the radios are in 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:29.449
 talking about that it's going that price and 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.730
 I went to see the coach we discussed 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.920
 I tell him but I open you what I 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.350
 did not insult him he told me no he even he 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.320
 was amazed he answered me ask a 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.230
 question tell me but we discussed in 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.250
 the cloakroom is a discussion that is 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.039
 to advance the team 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.579
 but who made it go out to the andorre 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.809
 to say that you added me I said 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.460
 no I want to know what is it 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.039
 have insult told me patrice leaves 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.410
 lèse majesté I did not hear 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.160
 to insult me ​​or anything that's 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:07.670
 hockey and after where is the problem 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.759
 it's actually at the moment of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.490
 anger of wanting to win the match because 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.649
 that the match he was within our reach and 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.770
 I saw widely that we can 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.979
 to win that's what it's not 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.229
 we missed the penalty where everyone 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.200
 is the sword nati and all mourad of 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.840
 opportunities but that's if it's a certain 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.369
 moment we know we missed we missed 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.079
 opportunities it's hard to 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.049
 football we are professional we know 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.659
 that behind his skin empty country behind 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.649
 we close the shop we close we get 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.180
 replace farm 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.240
 the goals we took is really a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.170
 purpose of mata but it's not because 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.539
 I speak for just wanting 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.119
 to speak now no not sincerely 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.549
 the hilarious coach choice to do it takes 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.500
 they make a choice we all have 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.609
 a heel the everyday is the choice 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.560
 the ones to this is to do 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.869
 and there frankly he asked me the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.130
 morning he told me I preferred the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.109
 holder 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.010
 wrong to make a choice I was forced 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.190
 to rage 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.000
 to five attackers me I'm not 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.620
 better than others 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.390
 men are not better like me 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.920
 so it's up to you to make the choice of 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 make a choice to have others play 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.180
 we will accompany them even if we 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640
 leave a muscle one will have both 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.650
 minutes we will make 100% because 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.450
 we're on a team it's not 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.910
 group is not for propitious nor for 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 ladies or a box so this is what 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.060
 money on is a team 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.160
 it's the people that belongs to the people 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.340
 Senegalese does not belong to us and 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 here and from there I played ten 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.930
 minutes the ten museums play them I had 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.700
 want to win the match as much 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.530
 other people we missed 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.080
 because it reminds me of my sleeves 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.450
 uganda we love we had to kill the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.880
 match we did not do it and behind 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.330
 folds the goal apart from appliances against the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.110
 guinea it's the same 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.270
 that's what we did not have much 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.560
 opportunities there we had the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.360
 situations because it's not the same 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 with an opportunity we had situations 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.450
 there poorly exploited and behind we took 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.420
 another goal 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.970
 and yesterday is the third time 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.770
 it says this is the thing that now you who 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.400
 repeated they made me a little 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.140
 scared which makes me say hey he 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 is it's time like because at each 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.760
 once we return to the locker room by his 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.959
 leader 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.370
 we are all very worried all the calm 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.100
 here I speak as a 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 player I want them to speak good player 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.190
 who is not who is not happy 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.580
 first to himself 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.620
 I'm not happy at first because I 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.019
 tell me if I gave myself more he got 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.519
 can the courtil to make me play 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.500
 me that's how I react game 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.390
 but the fault first on me I have not 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.700
 do what I have to do is why 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.890
 today team i got there but 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.880
 overall I also say we do not have 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.950
 do what we have to do 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.370
 because the team was largely 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.370
 our reach
