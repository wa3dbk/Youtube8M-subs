00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.310 

it's<00:00:06.729> relatively<00:00:07.210> easy<00:00:07.300> to<00:00:07.689> let<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.080> color

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
it's relatively easy to let the color

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.489 
it's relatively easy to let the color
sort<00:00:08.800> of<00:00:08.920> flow<00:00:09.190> and<00:00:09.580> run<00:00:09.849> and<00:00:10.419> sort<00:00:11.080> of<00:00:11.200> create

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:11.499 
sort of flow and run and sort of create

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.520 
sort of flow and run and sort of create
wonderful<00:00:11.919> accidental<00:00:12.669> effects<00:00:13.169> but<00:00:14.169> it<00:00:14.289> had

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
wonderful accidental effects but it had

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.810 
wonderful accidental effects but it had
the<00:00:14.679> next<00:00:14.860> question<00:00:15.219> is<00:00:15.339> well<00:00:15.490> then<00:00:15.610> how<00:00:15.759> do

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
the next question is well then how do

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.360 
the next question is well then how do
you<00:00:15.969> get<00:00:16.120> the<00:00:16.240> paint<00:00:16.450> on<00:00:16.539> smoothly<00:00:17.110> now<00:00:18.040> to<00:00:18.100> do

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.370 
you get the paint on smoothly now to do

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.420 
you get the paint on smoothly now to do
that<00:00:18.610> I'm<00:00:19.090> going<00:00:19.330> to<00:00:19.390> mix<00:00:19.600> a<00:00:19.720> color<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.620> this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
that I'm going to mix a color and this

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.740 
that I'm going to mix a color and this
time<00:00:21.670> I'm<00:00:21.790> going<00:00:21.910> to<00:00:22.000> try<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.210> put<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.570> color

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
time I'm going to try to put the color

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.360 
time I'm going to try to put the color
on<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:25.060> more<00:00:25.410> directly<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:26.530> smoothly

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
on a little more directly and smoothly

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.220 
on a little more directly and smoothly
in<00:00:28.090> this<00:00:28.180> case<00:00:28.420> I'll<00:00:28.600> use<00:00:28.630> something<00:00:28.960> like<00:00:29.080> a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
in this case I'll use something like a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.740 
in this case I'll use something like a
cat<00:00:29.590> orange<00:00:30.070> with<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.370> touch<00:00:30.700> of<00:00:30.730> cad<00:00:31.240> red<00:00:31.480> in<00:00:31.660> it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
cat orange with a touch of cad red in it

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.160 
cat orange with a touch of cad red in it
and<00:00:32.649> mostly<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.520> do<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.269> this<00:00:34.390> way<00:00:34.600> simply<00:00:34.870> so

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
and mostly I do it this way simply so

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.720 
and mostly I do it this way simply so
you<00:00:35.199> can<00:00:35.469> all<00:00:35.620> see<00:00:35.890> how<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.280> comes<00:00:36.550> together

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
you can all see how this comes together

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.310 
you can all see how this comes together
and<00:00:37.269> what<00:00:37.510> we're<00:00:37.600> gonna<00:00:37.690> do<00:00:37.870> now<00:00:38.019> is<00:00:38.050> we're

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
and what we're gonna do now is we're

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.049 
and what we're gonna do now is we're
gonna<00:00:38.379> put<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:38.890> wash<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.609> way<00:00:39.850> and

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
gonna put this wash on this way and

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.559 
gonna put this wash on this way and
we're<00:00:40.149> gonna<00:00:40.210> try<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.570> get<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:40.960> on<00:00:41.050> smoothly

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:46.919 

sometimes<00:00:46.569> you<00:00:46.659> get<00:00:46.719> these<00:00:46.870> little

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
sometimes you get these little

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.809 
sometimes you get these little
variations<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.100> things<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:48.579> comes

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
variations and things and this comes

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.130 
variations and things and this comes
through<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.210> handling<00:00:49.659> and<00:00:49.809> there's<00:00:50.019> not

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
through the handling and there's not

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.989 
through the handling and there's not
much<00:00:50.319> you<00:00:50.379> can<00:00:50.559> do<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.800> get<00:00:50.980> them<00:00:51.100> out<00:00:51.219> but<00:00:51.850> what

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
much you can do to get them out but what

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.549 
much you can do to get them out but what
I'm<00:00:52.089> doing<00:00:52.149> right<00:00:52.480> now<00:00:52.539> is<00:00:52.719> I'm<00:00:53.050> just<00:00:53.079> painting

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
I'm doing right now is I'm just painting

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.160 
I'm doing right now is I'm just painting
the<00:00:53.800> color<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.249> on<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.489> smooth<00:00:54.879> basis<00:00:55.479> now<00:00:56.109> you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
the color in on a smooth basis now you

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.599 
the color in on a smooth basis now you
see<00:00:56.379> what<00:00:56.530> happened<00:00:56.859> right<00:00:57.010> there<00:00:57.039> that's

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
see what happened right there that's

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.090 
see what happened right there that's
mostly<00:00:58.239> being<00:00:58.479> caused<00:00:58.780> by<00:00:59.050> some<00:00:59.620> kind<00:00:59.859> of<00:00:59.979> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
mostly being caused by some kind of a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.250 
mostly being caused by some kind of a
grease<00:01:00.510> situation<00:01:01.510> that's<00:01:01.690> happened<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.139> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
grease situation that's happened in the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.779 
grease situation that's happened in the
handling<00:01:02.710> or<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> transportation

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
handling or the transportation

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.700 
handling or the transportation
transportation<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.629> paper<00:01:04.839> usually<00:01:05.440> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
transportation of the paper usually the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.800 
transportation of the paper usually the
way<00:01:05.799> I<00:01:05.829> treat<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.219> is<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.270> just<00:01:07.509> simply<00:01:07.780> just

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
way I treat that is to just simply just

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.959 
way I treat that is to just simply just
get<00:01:08.079> in<00:01:08.229> here<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:08.680> scrub<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.040> out<00:01:09.159> and

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
get in here and just scrub it out and

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.209 
get in here and just scrub it out and
disperse<00:01:10.509> it<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.200> hopefully<00:01:11.439> we<00:01:11.829> can<00:01:11.860> get<00:01:12.070> it

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
disperse it and hopefully we can get it

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.850 
disperse it and hopefully we can get it
down<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.110> see<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.590> offense

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
down you know to see it's the offense

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
down you know to see it's the offense
that<00:01:14.950> just<00:01:15.189> almost<00:01:15.490> absolutely<00:01:15.939> disappeared

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.270 

now<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.229> where<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.439> roller<00:01:20.649> comes<00:01:21.039> in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
now this is where the roller comes in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.069 
now this is where the roller comes in
because<00:01:21.700> what<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.969> roller<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.509> do<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.930> can

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
because what the roller can do it can

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.440 
because what the roller can do it can
take<00:01:23.259> all<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.649> variation<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.210> begin

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
take all that variation and it can begin

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.880 
take all that variation and it can begin
to<00:01:25.659> smooth<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.079> now<00:01:26.229> watch<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.560> take<00:01:26.740> that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
to smooth it now watch you take that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.029 
to smooth it now watch you take that
whole<00:01:27.159> area<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:28.060> roughness<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.860> how<00:01:29.950> I'm

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
whole area of roughness and see how I'm

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.010 
whole area of roughness and see how I'm
smoothing<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.609> out<00:01:30.670> completely<00:01:31.270> just

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
smoothing that out completely just

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.289 
smoothing that out completely just
literally<00:01:32.500> creating<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.219> rolling<00:01:33.609> situation

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
literally creating a rolling situation

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.779 
literally creating a rolling situation
there's<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.350> little<00:01:35.590> patch<00:01:35.740> there<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.340> there's

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
there's a little patch there and there's

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:37.709 
there's a little patch there and there's
another<00:01:37.030> one<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.570> I'm<00:01:37.659> just

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
another one so you know I'm just

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.749 
another one so you know I'm just
basically<00:01:38.259> coming<00:01:38.500> back<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:39.280> wiping

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
basically coming back in and just wiping

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.899 
basically coming back in and just wiping
them<00:01:39.850> down<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:40.719> they<00:01:40.840> can<00:01:41.020> be<00:01:41.140> controlled

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
them down so that they can be controlled

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.999 
them down so that they can be controlled
if<00:01:43.330> these<00:01:43.540> things<00:01:43.750> occur<00:01:44.110> I've<00:01:44.439> never<00:01:44.710> had<00:01:44.890> too

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
if these things occur I've never had too

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.499 
if these things occur I've never had too
much<00:01:45.130> success<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.670> getting<00:01:45.759> them<00:01:46.000> out<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.360> so

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
much success in getting them out and so

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.910 
much success in getting them out and so
I've<00:01:46.659> sort<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.200> sort<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.470> put<00:01:47.650> him<00:01:47.740> into

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
I've sort of just sort of put him into

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.070 
I've sort of just sort of put him into
my<00:01:48.189> visual<00:01:48.700> vocabulary<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.600> let<00:01:49.780> them<00:01:49.930> sort

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
my visual vocabulary and let them sort

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.590 
my visual vocabulary and let them sort
of<00:01:50.229> exist<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:50.970> accept<00:01:51.970> them<00:01:52.090> as<00:01:52.270> part<00:01:52.509> of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
of exist and just accept them as part of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.760 
of exist and just accept them as part of
the<00:01:52.690> accident<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:55.240> you'd<00:01:56.049> like<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.380> take<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.680> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the accident if you'd like to take it to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.320 
the accident if you'd like to take it to
the<00:01:56.860> next<00:01:57.009> level<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.610> where<00:01:57.970> you're<00:01:58.119> going<00:01:58.149> to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the next level of where you're going to

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.899 
the next level of where you're going to
add<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.990> variation<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.799> that<00:02:00.130> let's<00:02:00.520> let's<00:02:00.820> just

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
add a variation to that let's let's just

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.219 
add a variation to that let's let's just
add<00:02:01.210> another<00:02:01.540> color<00:02:01.899> down<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:05.080> what

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
add another color down here and what

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.450 
add another color down here and what
we're<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.500> do<00:02:05.560> now<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:06.070> create<00:02:06.310> a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
we're going to do now is create a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.340 
we're going to do now is create a
gradation<00:02:07.380> between<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.920> smooth<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.580> and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
gradation between this smooth one and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
gradation between this smooth one and
into<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.709> way<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.700> just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
into that and way I do it is I just

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.570 
into that and way I do it is I just
basically<00:02:13.090> smooth<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.900> out<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:15.370> bring

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
basically smooth this out and then bring

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180 
basically smooth this out and then bring
this<00:02:15.880> up<00:02:16.150> into<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.870> gradually<00:02:17.319> until<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.160> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
this up into it gradually until I get a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.940 
this up into it gradually until I get a
what<00:02:18.550> essentially<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> nice<00:02:20.200> transition

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
what essentially is a nice transition

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:30.790 
what essentially is a nice transition
between<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.790> two<00:02:21.819> colors

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.860
