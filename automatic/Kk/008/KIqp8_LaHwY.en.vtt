00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.040
 Hello, I want to tell you how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.260
 can clean the computer radiator 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.260
 Kellet while packard gave 26 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410
 here is the dust 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.000
 first time I took it apart completely 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:31.160
 the processes are quite time consuming and 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.040
 takes about an hour and a half if not 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.059
 need to change thermal grease in 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.059
 principle to disassemble 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.620
 no need 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.370
 just clean 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 radiator itself 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.880
 for this we need the usual 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.880
 paper clip 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.030
 here 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.310
 what are we doing 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 the video shows the radiator ducts we 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.330
 on top gently insert the clip and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.940
 pushing 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.409
 clip length 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.450
 is up 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.450
 no more than five centimeters 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 and so every time 2 but not neatly 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.820
 in a hurry 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.010
 cleansing 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 Further 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.290
 we have air ducts and below 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.490
 doing exactly the same operation 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:09.799
 clip neatly bottom 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.799
 we insert an air duct and we clean 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 radiator 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.250
 Further 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.930
 we reach the connector 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.740
 and 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.740
 we bend 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:41.870
 creak this way in order to 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.870
 clear bottom 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.270
 we need a radiator duct 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.920
 Insert the clip along the guide down and 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.920
 just as neat 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.750
 clean 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.060
 Further 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 take the vacuum cleaner 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.640
 preferably more powerful if there is 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.630
 adjustment then you need to turn on full 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.630
 power and 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.360
 this is now the ventilation 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.090
 hole we bring vacuum cleaners and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.209
 prize autumn here means grieving 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.930
 chunks of dust 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:48.780
 which we must subsequently remove 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.780
 vacuuming slowly they are all in a hurry 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.830
 of this lattice should 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.020
 go out 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.019
 further for prevention we are all 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.489
 vent this and all of them 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.489
 vacuuming 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.410
 that's basically all 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.769
 the process takes no more than 5 minutes 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.900
 but your nickname 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.900
 calves bask stops working 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.900
 silently 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 But in general, and all all the success 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.770
 thanks for watching all the best
