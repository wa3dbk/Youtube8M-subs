00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.240
 point 8 scale 2 on two needles as 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.910
 you can see it is targeted so 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.080
 pretty is special for luck by 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.790
 example closed sweater or open sack 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.590
 allways you will always see very 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.590
 pretty is very easy 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.980
 very well only goes out right 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 by the rebel stitch is very even 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.240
 but the eights do not come out and those only 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.870
 they come out right 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.040
 This stitch should always be woven in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.040
 multiples of 5 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.750
 every eight is made up of five 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.650
 points and it stops so that it completes the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.890
 sample should be mishandled the multiple 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 of five plus two points first race 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.520
 two we start with two points upside down 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 and 2 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.290
 then we passed a point this 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.440
 point has to be spent putting the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:27.560
 needle between the point it happened then yew 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 two points 1 2 points yew and point 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 that does not knit the yew on the 2 points 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.640
 in which I did at a right point 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.960
 then we make 2 points 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.159
 reverse 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.700
 there is already we are doing the first of 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.800
 the 8 we started again we introduce 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.340
 the needle between the two points and the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.190
 we pass without knitting then we do 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.880
 two right spots 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 we passed the nonwoven point over the two 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 knitted stitches let go and then 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:11.240
 we make two points in reverse 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.380
 repeat step the point left 1 yew 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.980
 logos and the one that did not turn you step on the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:26.020
 two points knitted loose and I make a 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:30.310
 setback 2 step back the point left 1 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.870
 yew 2 step the nonwoven over the two 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.020
 knitted stitches and I make the colon 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.960
 reverse that corresponds as I started 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.840
 with two setbacks in the first race 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.440
 finished with two setbacks we're going to do the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.280
 second career 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.280
 as you see 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.290
 we start with two points to the right 1 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.390
 two points to the right then we make a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.960
 reverse 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.290
 a reverse point a loop from left to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.189
 right another point backwards 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.689
 two points on the right point ok let's go 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.689
 again to repeat it 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.400
 a reverse point 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.870
 a loop 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.870
 and another point backwards 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.360
 and two points to the right 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.670
 the entire race is done exactly 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.990
 so that you will not have to lose and 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.569
 so that they will not go wrong 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:49.900
 one back a loop 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.900
 a backhand point and two points together 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.700
 a reverse point 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.760
 a loop a backhand point and two points 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.430
 at the right point we finish our 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.720
 second race with two points at 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.630
 right like we started the race 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.440
 let's go to the third 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.690
 the third is very easy 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.860
 how are we going to start, we're going to 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.350
 start with two points upside down 12 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.090
 points upside down then we do 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.090
 three right spots 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.770
 two points upside down that's all the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.580
 career 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.610
 let's see how our sample is and 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.560
 that way the eight drafts are left by the 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.710
 side of the right if you have the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.730
 no doubt do not write tell me how it was 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.320
 in which they applied this beautiful stitch 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.470
 register on the channel that every day 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.460
 we have more and more interesting videos 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.460
