 which is one of the largest in america 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.240
 and producer here of the Russian circus on 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.490

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040
 working here in the Russian circus on 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.900
 ice work 8 years ago 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.509
 hello my name is ana I am five years old 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 about england and circus operations 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.979
 for almost almost a year 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.610
 we are used because everything of 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.160
 we give the conventional boy of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.830
 juggle the show with the animals 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.630
 why operate this circus with ice 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.880
 Well the first thing is that this circus does not 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.350
 has animals we merge what is the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.830
 traditional circus as comment the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.660
 juggle comedy magic everything 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 that you have all of the time and what 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.930
 we work with figure skating 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.460
 on ice what they see on television 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.670
 of the jumps what the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.440
 boys is like a combination that has 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.149
 stayed very nice very interesting 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.399
 not because all the same circus 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.720
 but on skates like that it gives more 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.720
 difficulty and more elegance 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.050
 and as a director and producer you 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.050
 motivates 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.560
 Let 's try a good gales my personality 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.810
 they know me on the track with what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.740
 it's my job they hate me they do not want me 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.710
 but hahahaha I am very strict but I think 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.750
 that any show is what it requires 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.740
 a very firm hand I always tell 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.210
 my skaters and with whom I work 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.490
 the only way to be able to show the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.050
 people what I do what I know how to do or 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.940
 express what I want is through 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.080
 them if I do not have them they do not 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.080
 I can do what I do 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.750
 the russian landlord who lays cal and good 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.540
 brings something new entertainment to 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.189
 see something different something nice something that 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.810
 it's for the whole family for the kids 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:29.950
 are not the children's productions 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.950
 like peter bread or the dignified and not charming 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.640
 no grace 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.980
 in the city 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.990
 I think what motivated an artist the most 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.640
 the applause of the people of the reaction 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.920
 of the people and see the reaction of the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.170
 children when they see that we are skating 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.180
 with the acrobatics of my classmates one 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.430
 sometimes it comes out of the show and people 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.340
 receives very well at the door of the circus 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.360
 well I think that's what 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.710
 particularly to me is what I most 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.710
 motivates to continue working 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.460
 how do they keep that ice good 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.350
 is imagine that is like a refrigerator 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.060
 giants this has a 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 antifreeze this has to be 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.520
 turned on 24 hours a day a day that 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.680
 it's off three hours four hours and 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.510
 water is made more was with the heat of 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.180
 Cali how to carry a discipline that is 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.610
 winter at any time of the year at 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.310
 cities where maybe it's not common to have 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.230
 that discipline in a show of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.320
 Olympic skating that they will see jumping 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.290
 spin and so on but that is the merger that 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.590
 of the circus numbers that are all 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.270
 with skates that is very difficult 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.390
 then it is this mixture of the fusion of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.760
 skating with the circus the circus 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.640
 traditional that's the interesting thing that 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.920
 has and also because we are of many 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.230
 many nationalities then each 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.820
 from the door a very distinctive stamp on 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.040
 the time we have specific people 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.380
 for the lights for the track and there is a 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.300
 Special staff for clothes a 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.040
 special character for the devices 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.590
 for all that is the staff the 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.420
 organization because there is also a lot of 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.110
 organization between number and number 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.110
 things 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.660
 interesting 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.060
 and a lot 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.720
 it's a quarter past seven and they 're 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.720
 they are going to present 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.529
 It's the time 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.529
 you want when my dream dies 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.449
 we can verify that the circus requires 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.220
 of dedication of love and of much 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.090
 requirement is a chronicle for time 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.090
 real real
