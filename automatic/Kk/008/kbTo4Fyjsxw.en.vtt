your<00:00:00.210> mama<00:00:00.420> no<00:00:01.050> yo<00:00:01.260> mama<00:00:01.530> Oh<00:00:01.770> miss<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.280> will

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.169 

we've<00:00:05.790> got<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.240> IG<00:00:06.720> X's<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.140> GPUs<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:09.059> it

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
we've got to IG X's and GPUs how is it

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.480 
we've got to IG X's and GPUs how is it
possible<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.570> an<00:00:09.630> ITX<00:00:10.080> GPU<00:00:10.620> my<00:00:11.190> guess<00:00:11.340> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
possible have an ITX GPU my guess it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.660 
possible have an ITX GPU my guess it's
just<00:00:11.670> small<00:00:12.080> ITX<00:00:13.080> form-factor<00:00:13.549> kind<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
just small ITX form-factor kind of a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
just small ITX form-factor kind of a
miss<00:00:14.849> number<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> GPU<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.289> they're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
miss number for a GPU right but they're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.029 
miss number for a GPU right but they're
designed<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.730> used<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.480> TX<00:00:18.900> cases<00:00:19.859> nice

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
designed to be used with I TX cases nice

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.769 
designed to be used with I TX cases nice
small<00:00:20.430> cases<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.029> these<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.270> both<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
small cases and these are both about the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.500 
small cases and these are both about the
same<00:00:21.960> damn<00:00:22.470> size<00:00:22.769> take<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> look<00:00:23.789> at<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> now

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
same damn size take a look at this now

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.609 
same damn size take a look at this now
we<00:00:24.570> did<00:00:24.750> reviews<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.140> both<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we did reviews on both of these this is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.480 
we did reviews on both of these this is
the<00:00:25.880> GTX<00:00:26.880> 760<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.630> TX<00:00:28.080> from<00:00:28.289> MSI<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.340> is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the GTX 760 I TX from MSI and this is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.770 
the GTX 760 I TX from MSI and this is
the<00:00:29.640> r9<00:00:30.119> 285<00:00:31.070> from<00:00:32.070> sapphire<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the r9 285 from sapphire now the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.440 
the r9 285 from sapphire now the
Sapphire<00:00:34.410> card<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.860> 285<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> slightly<00:00:36.180> slower

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Sapphire card the 285 is slightly slower

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.889 
Sapphire card the 285 is slightly slower
than<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> 280<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.610> 280<00:00:38.820> X<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.719> X

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
than like a 280 so it's the 280 X the X

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.389 
than like a 280 so it's the 280 X the X
always<00:00:40.079> makes<00:00:40.320> things<00:00:40.379> faster<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.250> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
always makes things faster because it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.750 
always makes things faster because it's
X<00:00:41.820> stream<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:43.399> how<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.610> these

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
X stream you know how they do these

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
X stream you know how they do these
things<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> industry<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.320> we're

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
things in the industry and what we're

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.569 
things in the industry and what we're
gonna<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.039> put<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:47.370> things

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
gonna do is we're gonna put these things

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.540 
gonna do is we're gonna put these things
head-to-head<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.950> fast<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.520> are

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
head-to-head see how how fast they are

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
head-to-head see how how fast they are
and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.149> gonna<00:00:51.239> talk<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.530> heat<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and then we're gonna talk about heat and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
and then we're gonna talk about heat and
noise<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.940> those<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.270> also<00:00:54.360> are

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
noise because those are also are

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
noise because those are also are
important<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.070> speed<00:00:56.250> sprite<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> most

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
important I think speed sprite the most

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
important I think speed sprite the most
important<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.149> maybe<00:00:57.360> maybe<00:00:58.109> depends<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
important right maybe maybe depends on

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
important right maybe maybe depends on
who<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.750> now<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> clear

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
who you are really now I have to clear

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
who you are really now I have to clear
something<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.129> before<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.640> too<00:01:02.879> into<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
something up before we get too into this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.289 
something up before we get too into this
a<00:01:05.299> GTX<00:01:06.299> 970<00:01:07.020> ITX<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:08.310> came<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.670> from

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
a GTX 970 ITX just came out from

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.929 
a GTX 970 ITX just came out from
gigabyte<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.590> spanks<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.250> guys<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.729> bends

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
gigabyte that spanks these guys it bends

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.640 
gigabyte that spanks these guys it bends
them<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.360> their<00:01:12.479> knee<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.930> spanks

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
them over their knee and just spanks

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.210 
them over their knee and just spanks
their<00:01:13.860> butts<00:01:14.189> their<00:01:15.150> behinds<00:01:15.810> their<00:01:16.770> gluteus

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
their butts their behinds their gluteus

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580 
their butts their behinds their gluteus
is<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.880> spanks<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.170> looks<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.470> I'm

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
is just spanks them this looks like I'm

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.780 
is just spanks them this looks like I'm
like<00:01:19.740> getting<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:20.100> yeah

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
like getting down yeah

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
like getting down yeah
that<00:01:21.630> card<00:01:21.840> spanks<00:01:22.200> him<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.650> like

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that card spanks him but it's also like

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
that card spanks him but it's also like
a<00:01:22.920> hundred<00:01:23.220> bucks<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.570> gonna<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a hundred bucks more so we're gonna have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
a hundred bucks more so we're gonna have
to<00:01:24.930> call<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> mid-range<00:01:26.189> ITX<00:01:26.939> GPU

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to call this like the mid-range ITX GPU

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
to call this like the mid-range ITX GPU
shootout<00:01:28.140> alright<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
shootout alright so right here on the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.660 
Hertz you should watch the video because
I<00:01:55.860> forgot<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> write<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> down

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I forgot to write that down

alright<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.600> let's<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.259> talk<00:01:58.409> about

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
alright now let's go and just talk about

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.990 
alright now let's go and just talk about
benchmarks<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.579> what<00:01:59.700> matters

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
benchmarks because that's what matters

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.569 
benchmarks because that's what matters
alright<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.659> BioShock<00:02:00.930> Infinite<00:02:01.579> between

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
alright in BioShock Infinite between

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
alright in BioShock Infinite between
these<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:02.820> cards<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> pretty<00:02:04.140> much<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.500> tie

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
these two cards it is pretty much a tie

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.550 
these two cards it is pretty much a tie
like<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.180> neck-and-neck<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.350> one

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
like really really neck-and-neck the one

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
like really really neck-and-neck the one
thing<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.920> say<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> GTX<00:02:09.000> 760<00:02:09.420> had

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
thing I will say is that the GTX 760 had

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960 
thing I will say is that the GTX 760 had
slightly<00:02:10.200> better<00:02:10.770> frame<00:02:11.099> times<00:02:11.489> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
slightly better frame times but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.490 
slightly better frame times but
not<00:02:12.060> by<00:02:12.210> much<00:02:12.420> only<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> little<00:02:13.020> bit<00:02:13.230> we're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
not by much only a little bit we're

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.840 
not by much only a little bit we're
doing<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:13.950> maxed<00:02:14.160> out<00:02:14.250> 1080p<00:02:14.700> which

know I do want to say this really favors
the<00:02:22.260> AMD<00:02:22.650> stuff<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.310> got<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> AMD

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
the AMD stuff because it's got the AMD

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.250 
the AMD stuff because it's got the AMD
logo<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.210> pops<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.600> when<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.810> first<00:02:25.020> start

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
logo that pops up when you first start

the<00:02:25.290> game<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.790> course<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.690> AMD<00:02:28.230> wins<00:02:28.770> by<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the game so of course the AMD wins by a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.750 
the game so of course the AMD wins by a
hefty<00:02:30.300> margin<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:30.870> talking<00:02:31.170> 41<00:02:32.130> average<00:02:32.520> on

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
hefty margin we're talking 41 average on

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.320 
hefty margin we're talking 41 average on
the<00:02:33.030> GTX<00:02:33.600> 760<00:02:34.080> all<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.770> 60

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the GTX 760 all the way up to like 60

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.810 
the GTX 760 all the way up to like 60
2.64<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.660> aim<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.200> optimized<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.670> go

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
2.64 so aim be optimized there you go

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.580 
2.64 so aim be optimized there you go
moving<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> thief<00:02:39.960> another<00:02:40.200> game<00:02:40.410> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
moving on to the thief another game that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.960 
moving on to the thief another game that
is<00:02:40.680> AMD<00:02:40.890> optimized<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.520> well<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
is AMD optimized as well I think I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
is AMD optimized as well I think I
picked<00:02:42.150> too<00:02:42.270> many<00:02:42.390> AMD<00:02:42.690> optimized<00:02:43.050> games<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
picked too many AMD optimized games and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530 
picked too many AMD optimized games and
the<00:02:43.710> hate<00:02:43.890> mail<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.340> gonna<00:02:44.580> start<00:02:44.820> rolling<00:02:45.090> in

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the hate mail is gonna start rolling in

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.800 
the hate mail is gonna start rolling in
yeah<00:02:46.170> alright<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.060> game<00:02:48.180> thief<00:02:48.540> oh

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
yeah alright so in the game thief oh

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
yeah alright so in the game thief oh
it's<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.530> time<00:02:49.800> when<00:02:50.250> we're<00:02:50.430> running

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's about a time when we're running

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.940 
it's about a time when we're running
DirectX<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.330> pretty<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:51.630> another<00:02:52.260> tie<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
DirectX it's pretty much another tie and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
DirectX it's pretty much another tie and
again<00:02:53.520> we<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> 760<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.990> slightly

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
again we see the 760 with slightly

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.130 
again we see the 760 with slightly
better<00:02:55.440> frame<00:02:55.860> times<00:02:56.330> but<00:02:57.330> when<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> turn

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
better frame times but when you turn

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.280 
better frame times but when you turn
mantle<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:59.010> goes<00:02:59.610> from<00:03:00.570> 39<00:03:01.080> FPS<00:03:01.709> up<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.400> 40

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
mantle on it goes from 39 FPS up to 40

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.470 
mantle on it goes from 39 FPS up to 40
8.9<00:03:04.290> FPS<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.190> when<00:03:05.730> Mantle's<00:03:06.000> turned<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.300> its

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
8.9 FPS so when Mantle's turned on its

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.440 
8.9 FPS so when Mantle's turned on its
another<00:03:06.660> spanking<00:03:07.880> alright<00:03:08.880> last<00:03:09.060> game<00:03:09.270> we

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
another spanking alright last game we

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.000 
another spanking alright last game we
decided<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> test<00:03:10.140> was<00:03:10.350> trying<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.950> that's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
decided to test was trying to and that's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.500 
decided to test was trying to and that's
an<00:03:11.220> indie<00:03:11.430> game<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.610> doesn't<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.209> favor

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
an indie game that doesn't really favor

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.320 
an indie game that doesn't really favor
one<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.990> other<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.910> see<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
one of the other and there we see the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.259 
one of the other and there we see the
the<00:03:15.360> 285<00:03:16.320> pulling<00:03:16.769> ahead<00:03:17.040> by<00:03:17.400> about<00:03:17.640> 11<00:03:18.060> frames

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the 285 pulling ahead by about 11 frames

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.300 
the 285 pulling ahead by about 11 frames
per<00:03:18.450> second<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.260> decent<00:03:19.739> win<00:03:19.890> there<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
per second so a decent win there for the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.240 
per second so a decent win there for the
285<00:03:20.820> overall<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.290> all<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.680> speed<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.130> all

285 overall with all the speed and all
the<00:03:23.370> different<00:03:23.519> games<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.850> looked<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> GTX

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
the different games we looked at the GTX

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.890 
the different games we looked at the GTX
760<00:03:25.709> didn't<00:03:26.100> win<00:03:26.220> many<00:03:26.459> categories<00:03:26.790> even<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.840> a

lot of the other games we didn't test it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.610

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
games

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.509 
games
I'm<00:03:33.840> also<00:03:33.989> Metro<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> seems<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.070> do<00:03:35.190> better<00:03:35.370> in

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
I'm also Metro it seems to do better in

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.840 
I'm also Metro it seems to do better in
Metro<00:03:35.959> compared<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.140> card<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.280> 285

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
Metro compared to this card but the 285

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.030 
Metro compared to this card but the 285
just<00:03:39.420> seems<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> slightly<00:03:40.530> stronger

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
just seems to be a slightly stronger

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.670 
just seems to be a slightly stronger
card<00:03:41.549> than<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> 760<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.870> now<00:03:43.350> let's<00:03:43.590> talk

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
card than the 760 so now let's talk

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.350 
card than the 760 so now let's talk
about<00:03:43.920> noise<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.910> temperatures

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
about noise and just temperatures

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.840 
about noise and just temperatures
because<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> also<00:03:46.200> weigh<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.130> an<00:03:47.400> idle

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
because that can also weigh in an idle

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.780 
because that can also weigh in an idle
they're<00:03:48.000> both<00:03:48.180> around<00:03:48.299> 30<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.019> 35<00:03:49.500> as<00:03:50.220> far<00:03:50.730> as

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
they're both around 30 to 35 as far as

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.330 
they're both around 30 to 35 as far as
the<00:03:50.880> decibel<00:03:51.269> goes<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.920> when<00:03:53.100> they<00:03:53.190> run

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
the decibel goes but then when they run

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.270 
the decibel goes but then when they run
at<00:03:53.459> full<00:03:53.670> load<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.750> 760<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.590> around<00:03:55.980> fifty

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
at full load the 760 is around fifty

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.890 
at full load the 760 is around fifty
three<00:03:56.430> point<00:03:56.580> five<00:03:56.880> decibels<00:03:57.269> whereas<00:03:57.720> this

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
three point five decibels whereas this

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.680 
three point five decibels whereas this
one<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.260> 50<00:03:58.950> decibels<00:03:59.100> very<00:04:00.000> similar<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:00.540> this

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
one is 50 decibels very similar but this

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.750 
one is 50 decibels very similar but this
one's<00:04:00.900> slightly<00:04:01.440> better<00:04:01.769> now<00:04:02.370> when<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:02.670> comes

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
one's slightly better now when it comes

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.720 
one's slightly better now when it comes
to<00:04:02.880> temps<00:04:03.269> at<00:04:03.600> full<00:04:03.930> load<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.410> maxed<00:04:04.890> out<00:04:04.950> at<00:04:05.130> 70

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
to temps at full load I maxed out at 70

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.440 
to temps at full load I maxed out at 70
whereas<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.170> temps<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.650> AMD<00:04:08.190> 285<00:04:09.030> were

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
whereas the the temps on AMD 285 were

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.840 
whereas the the temps on AMD 285 were
around<00:04:09.830> 66<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.370> was<00:04:11.459> after<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.700> know

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
around 66 and that was after you know

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.520 
around 66 and that was after you know
playing<00:04:12.120> games<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.630> 10<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:12.750> 15<00:04:13.080> minutes<00:04:13.380> so

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
playing games for 10 or 15 minutes so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.340 
playing games for 10 or 15 minutes so
there<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:13.920> have<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.670> 285<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
there you have it the the 285 is the the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.949 
there you have it the the 285 is the the
clear<00:04:16.620> winner<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.519> one<00:04:17.820> oddity<00:04:18.540> about<00:04:18.570> this

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
clear winner the one oddity about this

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.650 
clear winner the one oddity about this
card<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.150> power<00:04:21.330> connector

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
card is that the the power connector

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.850 
card is that the the power connector
there<00:04:21.840> got<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.229> know<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.380> pin<00:04:22.710> power

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
there got a you know a pin power

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.110 
there got a you know a pin power
connector<00:04:22.979> it's<00:04:23.820> mounted<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.570> back

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
connector it's mounted on the back

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
connector it's mounted on the back
so<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.570> have<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.750> case<00:04:25.960> that's<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.530> know

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
so if you have a case that's you know

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.800 
so if you have a case that's you know
very<00:04:26.680> short<00:04:27.310> you're<00:04:28.150> not<00:04:28.330> gonna<00:04:28.450> be<00:04:28.600> able<00:04:28.690> to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
very short you're not gonna be able to

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.510 
very short you're not gonna be able to
get<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.470> cable<00:04:29.650> plugged<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.160> there<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.400> even

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
get the cable plugged in there so even

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.500 
get the cable plugged in there so even
though<00:04:30.700> they're<00:04:30.820> about<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.090> same<00:04:31.240> length

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
though they're about the same length

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.940 
though they're about the same length
this<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:31.840> gonna<00:04:32.080> add<00:04:32.290> some<00:04:32.470> length<00:04:32.680> because

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
this is gonna add some length because

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.930 
this is gonna add some length because
you're<00:04:33.040> gonna<00:04:33.130> have<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.310> snake<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.580> cable

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
you're gonna have to snake a cable

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.060 
you're gonna have to snake a cable
around<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.360> bend<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.750> plug<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.200> kind

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
around and bend it and plug it in kind

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.760 
around and bend it and plug it in kind
of<00:04:36.400> awkward<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.120> as<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.690> can<00:04:37.810> see<00:04:37.990> here<00:04:38.320> with

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
of awkward and as you can see here with

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.920 
of awkward and as you can see here with
the<00:04:38.889> 760<00:04:39.520> it's<00:04:39.730> right<00:04:40.090> there<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.480> top<00:04:40.720> and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
the 760 it's right there on the top and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
the 760 it's right there on the top and
again<00:04:41.080> we<00:04:41.169> have<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.410> pin<00:04:41.650> power<00:04:41.860> connector

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
again we have the a pin power connector

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.570 
again we have the a pin power connector
right<00:04:43.150> there<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.200> think<00:04:45.130> that's<00:04:45.400> more

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
right there so I think that's more

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.100 
right there so I think that's more
convenient<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.120> my<00:04:46.240> opinion<00:04:46.570> it'll<00:04:46.810> work<00:04:46.960> with

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
convenient in my opinion it'll work with

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.860 
convenient in my opinion it'll work with
more<00:04:47.320> configurations<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:49.540> know<00:04:49.630> it's<00:04:49.780> up

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
more configurations but you know it's up

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.360 
more configurations but you know it's up
to<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.080> whatever<00:04:50.350> works<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:50.830> your<00:04:50.980> happy

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
to you whatever works in your happy

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.610 
to you whatever works in your happy
little<00:04:51.520> world<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.940> can<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:52.600> man<00:04:52.750> so

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
little world you can just do it man so

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.310 
little world you can just do it man so
again<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.130> sum<00:04:54.310> up<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.580> entire<00:04:54.700> video<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.630> 970

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
again to sum up the entire video the 970

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.500 
again to sum up the entire video the 970
from<00:04:56.530> gigabyte<00:04:56.940> Spanx<00:04:57.940> everything<00:04:58.270> if<00:04:58.390> you've

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
from gigabyte Spanx everything if you've

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.840 
from gigabyte Spanx everything if you've
got<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.690> little<00:04:58.840> extra<00:04:58.960> money<00:04:59.320> but<00:05:00.310> if<00:05:00.640> you're

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
got a little extra money but if you're

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.010 
got a little extra money but if you're
trying<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.090> save<00:05:01.210> 100<00:05:01.570> bucks

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
trying to save 100 bucks

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.280 
trying to save 100 bucks
I<00:05:02.050> think<00:05:02.890> the<00:05:03.010> 285<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.150> currently<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.110> way<00:05:05.230> to

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
I think the 285 is currently the way to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.409 
I think the 285 is currently the way to
go<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.740> it<00:05:05.800> also<00:05:05.919> will<00:05:06.250> do<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.940> know<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.240> hell

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
go and it also will do a you know a hell

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.640
