00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hello people from current occasion have 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.979
 I thought about it yourself 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.509
 Theft is not really worth it 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.730
 I aspire to a criminal career 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.960
 but because of me the other day 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.210
 the cellar was broken 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.550
 for the second time in a year 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.080
 It always means crime is worthwhile 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.490
 not as far as I know they were 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.869
 stupid penner who joined me 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.430
 are still not popped worth it 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.289
 Theft may be so 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.179
 the most obvious approach to this question 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.250
 to answer it is the waving prey 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.830
 to weigh against the impending penalty 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.630
 and that's ten years 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.160
 Of course you do not have to live for ten years 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.780
 Build when you pack in the supermarket 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.950
 you have to take something for that 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.720
 probably already half the city and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.400
 surroundings from behind with dynamite one 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.570
 Bank vault to speak on but what 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.830
 should not mean that it is a 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.370
 cavalier offense is when you have something 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.990
 Stolen 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.580
 It is and will always be a criminal offense 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.990
 be prosecuted if it 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.700
 is brought to the display and the 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.870
 fine potentially expects a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.980
 in any case above the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.080
 purchase price of a pack 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.370
 knowledges are but the penalty would be 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.200
 in the case probably one more 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 least problem in case of one 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.850
 Condemnation will be a grave offense 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.950
 namely in various registers 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.330
 enlisted many employers required 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.100
 from their competitors an abstract 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.840
 your police certificate and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.700
 you may not stand up 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.590
 immigrant is noted that you already 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 times peanuts stole because who 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.070
 Peanuts cloud the cloud maybe too 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.720
 pens and tucker cling and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 Eats small children anyway 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.840
 Add to that the criminal record 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
 more difficult is visa and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.090
 entry permit for some countries to 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.130
 to get 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.180
 are ye so in Germany cup 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.380
 you can not get out of it yet 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.760
 we only have the side of the offender 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 considered, we now refer 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.600
 once the theft taker with one 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 a little example introduces you 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.350
 times before such a Vollhorst was like that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
 clever his wallet under the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.420
 Windshield of his car lying to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.820
 to let 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.460
 then a nasty gangster could therefore 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.490
 and you serve the purse there and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.050
 naturally smell his chance to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.310
 immeasurable wealth all beats so 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.030
 he unceremoniously the side window of the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 cars 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.750
 take the wallet and run away 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.220
 behind the next corner or country 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.659
 wallet and is happy about whole 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.030
 five euros 37 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.130
 that was really worth it or the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.240
 thief now has five euros 37 more that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.870
 at least enough for a few pack 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.220
 gerd nuts 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.929
 the stolen one, on the other hand, I have to do now 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.310
 not just buy a new wallet 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.780
 I also have a new ID card 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.100
 make must be new 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.870
 organize driver's license 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.760
 he has to have his ec card blocked 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 his credit card must apply for new ones 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.720
 And not to forget the side window 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.340
 his car is in the ass and this one 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.880
 Damage should he fix better quickly 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.290
 to let 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.480
 otherwise maybe someone else will come 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.130
 again looked over and understands that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.870
 open windows as an invitation equal to that 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.950
 to take the whole car he would have to 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 actually fast becoming an urgent one 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 meeting his wife gets just a 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.270
 child and he got fast 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.370
 buy peanuts 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.930
 Well had bad luck now must first 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.030
 drive workshop that was natural now 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.620
 a relatively exaggerated plays at 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.000
 but not completely from the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 air is something like that comes 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 in fact, in many cases, that is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.069
 booty of the thief significantly lower than 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.750
 he harms him with the theft 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.650
 has done that will also equal to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.150
 next problem 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.400
 Theft is with many uncertainties 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
 connected in many cases that the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.700
 size of the prey in advance only very 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.470
 Hard to guess you never know if it is 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.730
 maybe not one after all 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 Security camera gives the man 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.510
 overlooked in advance whether ob 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.209
 a concrete theft will happen 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.500
 is almost impossible but we lift the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.900
 ask now for a whole 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.310
 abstract level on several pages in the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.930
 internet let the argument that is 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.370
 It is completely unjust that the big ones 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.900
 make companies billions 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.520
 while the poorest of the poor are watching 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.470
 have enough to get over the rounds 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.180
 From this, the favorite propagandists are leading 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.739
 in good old age robin wood paints that 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.780
 is perfectly okay is from the rich 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.400
 to take and the needy so before 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.319
 give yourself everything because of that 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.860
 Call for collective shoplifting 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.500
 as fight against the system sends on 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.629
 the evil capitalism is worth the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.510
 maybe parliaments and yes indeed 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.220
 for justice 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.629
 no every year alone in 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.209
 German stores were worth of 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.680
 stolen over four billion euros that 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.270
 This is a sum which the traders naturally 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.550
 somehow have to compensate 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.930
 by raising the prices and that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.940
 Of course, things are going to be over 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.590
 the burden of the poor who swims in the money 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.569
 it does not matter if that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.310
 double for his honor 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:06.930
 it always has to pay for that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.930
 Still peanuts that was good or not at all 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.109
 but who are already hard on the minimum existence 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.579
 Everybody lives for that means 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.320
 price increase the country any 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.030
 To give up the job must be added 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.349
 that means that the start belongs to tax 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.759
 by the overlap I go there my 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.320
 is beyond question that the taxpayers 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.130
 not always optimally invested 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 become berlin airport brandenburg 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.289
 however, the state needs the money 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.449
 also for example for education issues 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.430
 or social benefits the concept of this 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.840
 hobby anarchists is not so 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.550
 all of you have the whole thing 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.750
 not so well thought out or she herself 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.520
 just needed a cheap one 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.240
 excuse her own love 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.039
 justify 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.870
 So I would say theft and yourself 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.190
 generally not in the case of 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.229
 full of sparklers of my cellar 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.240
 It definitely broke up 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.620
 not worth it in the first place he has 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.900
 namely, a keyboard already captures that 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.039
 I have not worked for years 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.349
 had kept anyway because I thought 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.539
 You can do that music video 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.949
 really cool in slow motion on the floor 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.789
 threshing and playing in all 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.410
 individual parts 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.240
 who became certain now unfortunately 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.500
 nothing more I would like to do that 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.030
 Face of these stupid wanker 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.650
 seen as he has stated that is 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.840
 keyboard stops working so well 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.669
 asshole if you see yourself that here 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.169
 but how do you see that I have something 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.699
 it is worth noting important 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.440
 theft in the end maybe and 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.460
 have you ever been stolen or have you 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.330
 Maybe you yourself 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.370
 stuffed something 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.840
 i am looking forward to your comments though 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.340
 you liked the video then shares 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.870
 Please leave it with your friends 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 the whole world knows that 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.110
 Theft is not worth it if we use it 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.909
 even a single theft 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.800
 This video has been prevented 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.490
 Definitely worth it, we see 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.900
 us next week again makes it good and 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.590
 that was my mustard about the topic 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.849
 worth theft 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.320
 if you have more of my gelaber 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.789
 you want to hear then click below left there 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.710
 He comes to a video in which I tell you 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.419
 Ten really helpful move tips 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.259
 give if you just moves and 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.900
 do not look at you 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.340
 are you really to blame yourself 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.620
 On the right, Meiner is coming to the parody 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.240
 on rawabi from clean ended in the me 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.190
 make fun of me over parodies on youtube 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.699
 Have fun watching and until 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.699
 to the next week
