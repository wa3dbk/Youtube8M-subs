00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 and then beauty plus a video here from 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:30.450
 android tunado demonstrating to you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:35.040
 version 4 of the porte s5 highway that is 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:39.120
 with galaxy look s 6 then we 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 just demonstrate how the pomegranate is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 and your look 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 I'm going to tell you that it would not flow. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 lock has no leg 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 Nothing is good, right. There's this new one. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 design for you to focus on is that the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:07.439
 Setting is White Background 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.720
 but it is relative to the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.740
 settings from version 3.0 to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.929
 version 3 of the street is really only 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.679
 design is at the time of virus installation 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.810
 installed aroma has some applications 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.479
 not different than you can choose from 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.009
 time for the right installation 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.149
 the dialer it is with this new design 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.609
 new look 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.840
 It's a little different here, there's some 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:47.820
 dodge was more like that message 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.750
 floating 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.880
 It's because it does not work 100% I'm going 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.660
 letting you know this does not work 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 100% private mode this time he is 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:14.220
 working or is activating 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.230
 Negative in a good way to see the usual topics 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.240
 right 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.370
 another interesting detail people in the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.820
 site will be a download file 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.930
 right 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.040
 indeed two files is fine 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.440
 attention 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.810
 the file is referring to cpu control 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080
 that you may be controlling in this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.670
 street when you have on the streets customized 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.670
 and with acm in that which also now has 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 I'll show you that it's you, I'm going to go here. 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.360
 be there right for you active if you 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.980
 are in developer mode remembering 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.310
 that to activate you comes on the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.720
 device number seven 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.830
 times will activate the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.260
 developer 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.010
 If you go down there one of you will 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.850
 being up to pt made right 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.680
 this item will not watch with this 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.570
 file that you are not there had 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.350
 recovery're going to be these two 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:30.810
 system options which is cpu control 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:36.850
 where you control maximum frequency 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:41.370
 minimum frequency the governor 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:46.810
 you make all the control apply boat 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.870
 on boot right then you can have 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.320
 this control now in the ram that before no 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.140
 had another file that was going to go 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.710
 be available to you too 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:07.209
 It's going to be this file here that I'm going to 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:13.750
 show and will be available is 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:16.419
 Rain here is this right here O correction 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.870
 What is this file for? 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.240
 this file it serves to correct in 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.880
 some parts of the settings that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.930
 white background with white letter where you 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.970
 does not read anything 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.480
 pipo when you do it, it's all 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.880
 white is not going to stay anymore and this was a 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.660
 file that was taken from version 3 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.340
 It's just for this temporary correction 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.750
 while they do not correct the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.200
 developers 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.419
 When you went to the volume, you got everything. 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.360
 white you do not read if touch connects me 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.430
 and now with this file you can 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.480
 correct right 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.130
 in only a few files is not only in 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.669
 all 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.080
 certain funds that could not be 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.910
 to view 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.669
 now with this file will give you 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.590
 display is the same as the 2.5 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.380
 right 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.210
 the audio application is the same thing 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.290
 from version 3.0 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:29.160
 How can you see right? 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:33.090
 apps just reminding you 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.730
 the ultra mode works there in good 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.190
 energy saving 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.960
 so whatever settings are 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:47.510
 practically the same as other versions 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.650
 everything works quietly with a fluid and 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.390
 quite stable 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:58.260
