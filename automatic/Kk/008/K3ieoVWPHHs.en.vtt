00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.790
 Hi guys, I'm good, and I'm the video. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 today is tagged with five authors 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 who pointed me to this tag was the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.129
 triple book brand and who created the tag 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.850
 It was gabriel, I'm going to leave the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.740
 two down here in the information box 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.900
 but until then you have to choose five 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.089
 Clear authors you met in the year 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 tell you a little bit like you 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.189
 reached the respective books and how it was 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.019
 the reading experience if you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.160
 you want to read something else 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.500
 author or not 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
 so come the first book I 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.150
 I chose the unique volume of the chronicles 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.250
 cs lewis narnia was my first 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.740
 contact the author and for me 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.810
 on social networks knows that I 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.240
 I did not like the chronicles so much 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.520
 I read until now I started reading is 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.530
 motivated by the panda the boy henrique 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.080
 last year began a project there in the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.110
 blog that was reading the chronicles of narnia 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.730
 but as it did not surrender to me at the beginning 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.860
 I thought I was going to have a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 week in a little more than a month and until 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.990
 it was not quite finished 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 so my next chronicle is the trip 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.590
 of the Pilgrim of the Dawn 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 It was here that I stopped then this is the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.109
 next I'll read what I intend 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.429
 yes, it's finalizing this single volume now 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.789
 in 2014 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.289
 I expected a kind of narrative and not 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.420
 that's what I found but I 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.590
 I really like the marine universe so 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.749
 I'll continue 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.149
 The second book I chose to 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:33.240
 show in this video 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.100
 laurie house enderson is at the time receiving 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 this new concept book I could not 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 I do not think that much for him. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 another young adult dealing with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.490
 amenities of adolescence and everything else 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.460
 but it's not that much deeper he 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.789
 puts us in the head of the character 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.979
 main 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.709
 she is aware that what she does is 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.770
 wrong that damages your body to your 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.689
 head but she's really sick I 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.399
 I really did understand the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.789
 perspective that the author 's 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.100
 character was a great surprise. 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.789
 law I already showing the Indian super 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 2013 favorites also understands this 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.280
 about this book is from the instant of the line 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.230
 if you have the opportunity law and it was 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 super curious to know the fale 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.659
 also from the same author who was published 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.599
 last year by the publisher valentina 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.530
 my next chose a super super 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.540
 Your beloved selection of cnec s 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.819
 well I do not even have to say that I'm 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.799
 lace but for the dress to arrive soon 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.870
 third book of this class already be 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.360
 released here in Brazil i kill in a 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.239
 doubt of who America so he 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.459
 He chose to stay because at last 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.180
 second volume it is well divided 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.760
 but I'm like Maxson to who's who 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 Yesterday Maxson I'm still more 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.160
 raw pro matsson but I like the steel that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.170
 I also never know how I do not know the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.170
 name of the characters was always half 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.260
 hard but I liked it a lot though 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.530
 this trilogy it comes as it says topical 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.659
 What I really like about her is the contest is 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.209
 both the background though the 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.370
 volume 2 gives a much better picture 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.040
 than here in a while if you read a 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 missed some things in the 2nd 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.989
 will explain a little better and in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.389
 tales too but I do not face him 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.730
 both for this issue of dystopia and 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:31.470
 I really like this same technology. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 for the contest reality show 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.160
 and everything that is involved behind the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.200
 choice of a princess 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.780
 my next choice is the hill of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.299
 howling winds of charlotte bronte pm 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.410
 this book is nothing at all because 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.530
 imagined 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.150
 he is very different from a commander 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.879
 sugar water I wish I was 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.310
 waiting for it is also a book that moves 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.480
 enough with the psychological 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.220
 mainly because the character 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.370
 has some problems 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.519
 related to this is I could not 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.199
 I like the reffe but at the same time I 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.150
 I liked it, I understood everything he said 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.790
 and that he suffered 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.160
 and why did it arrive where it arrived but I 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.319
 I had this feeling of measure 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.400
 this was not a reading I did with 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.139
 speed 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.209
 I stayed over a month with this book 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.609
 Rolling back and forth and a little bit 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.949
 He got naked two weeks ago. 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.100
 then him a little bit more but not 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.720
 At the end I quite liked and Indian 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.510
 For those who are curious to know 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.280
 probably not the same thing as 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.460
 you think unless you already 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.400
 has taken a spoiler from the story and 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.880
 my last choice is our city 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.800
 Cassandra Claire's good that book I 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.770
 I wanted to read because of the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560
 movie on the challenge books your movies 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.380
 the 2013 edition and although he has some 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.340
 problems of continuity of review and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.140
 everything else 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.780
 I really liked the universe that 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.460
 house created so much that at the time 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.420
 I bought the other two books in a 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.120
 hit the bookstore only pay a horror right? 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.860
 the price of the most books I really 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.500
 I liked the universe she created and 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.540
 I intend to continue beyond the yes I like 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.240
 enough of the video movie about the two 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.790
 and in the channel of the blog then it is who stayed 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.770
 interested to know my opinion 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.290
 It's coming around here now, not yet. 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.480
 watched just look around the historic 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.010
 but it was a surprise despite the 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.230
 problems that the time book was 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.600
 really a good read 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.220
 Good people, that was my answer to 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.930
 up to five authors 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.970
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.760
 video a see who do I return to 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.230
 I do not remember if the staff left 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.130
 a lot of people but I go back to guide here 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.170
 I go back to guiding poetry fran deadlines 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.710
 in something more and always with background the name 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.490
 her blog is the order of words 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.210
 then fran i go back to guide who 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.980
 more 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.520
 I think the bruninho da bruninho the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.770
 Anderletch and the one who chatted with me 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.750

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.690
 You guys in the video but I do not think 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.100
 to roll 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.030
 and who else was to indicate the person 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.800
 either people call me qalay I always 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.550
 indicated the eipr tags né 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.820
 that is the doubt of the mouth of the buc adit 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.290
 So these four people I hope 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.680
 You guys have some time to record the video. 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.630
