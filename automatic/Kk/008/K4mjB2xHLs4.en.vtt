00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
really look any different than any other

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.440 
really look any different than any other
can<00:01:12.090> check<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.659> mean<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.960> chunks<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.250> uh

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
can check in I mean it's chunks but uh

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
can check in I mean it's chunks but uh
you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> only<00:01:15.990> label<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.650> his

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you know on the only label you see his

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.929 
you know on the only label you see his
little<00:01:16.860> grill<00:01:17.159> marks<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.520> stuff<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.820> thought

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
little grill marks and stuff I thought

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.450 
little grill marks and stuff I thought
it<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> frozen

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
it was gonna look just like the frozen

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
it was gonna look just like the frozen
grilled<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> ready<00:01:20.850> chicken<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.659> have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
grilled and ready chicken that they have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.149 
grilled and ready chicken that they have
which<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.170> believe<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> add<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.860> type<00:01:23.009> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
which I believe to add some type of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
which I believe to add some type of
artificial<00:01:23.610> grow<00:01:24.450> marks<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.229> but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
artificial grow marks or something but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.980 
artificial grow marks or something but
this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.860> looks<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.189> chunks<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
this is just looks like chunks of a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.910 
this is just looks like chunks of a
precooked<00:01:27.990> chicken<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> like

precooked chicken and a can like
anything<00:01:29.189> else<00:01:29.900> smells<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.320> too<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
anything else smells like it too but the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
anything else smells like it too but the
chicken<00:01:33.390> does<00:01:33.570> look<00:01:33.720> pretty<00:01:33.930> good<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.439> I'm
