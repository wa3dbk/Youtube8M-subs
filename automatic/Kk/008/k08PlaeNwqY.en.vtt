and using effect and surging and you

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.380 
and using effect and surging and you
know<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.400> works<00:03:35.610> itself<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.269> an

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
know it works itself so it's like an

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.030

succeed so it all works out so he should

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.240 
succeed so it all works out so he should
be<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.140> staple<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:22.710> my<00:04:22.800> cursor<00:04:23.039> should<00:04:23.190> be

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
be a staple I think my cursor should be

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.219 
be a staple I think my cursor should be
a<00:04:23.280> staple<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:24.510> offering<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.990> was<00:04:25.110> debating

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
a staple to offering I was debating

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.839 
a staple to offering I was debating
whether<00:04:25.620> plate<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.070> not<00:04:26.159> in<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> beginning<00:04:26.760> of

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
whether plate or not in the beginning of

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.870 
whether plate or not in the beginning of
the<00:04:26.940> tournament

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
the tournament

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.640 
the tournament
but<00:04:28.330> then<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.540> ended<00:04:28.720> up<00:04:28.810> playing<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.530> I

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
but then I ended up playing it and I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.020 
but then I ended up playing it and I
guess<00:04:29.890> it<00:04:30.040> worked<00:04:30.190> out<00:04:30.370> by<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.640> kind<00:04:30.940> of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
guess it worked out by the kind of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.030 
guess it worked out by the kind of
clogged<00:04:31.300> because<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.050> always<00:04:32.410> had<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.800> when<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
clogged because I always had it when I

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.440 
clogged because I always had it when I
didn't<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.490> monster<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.150> kind<00:04:34.390> of

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
didn't have a monster and it kind of

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.400 
didn't have a monster and it kind of
sucked<00:04:34.720> but<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:36.160> good<00:04:36.430> if<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:37.150> know<00:04:37.180> to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
sucked but it's good if you you know to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
sucked but it's good if you you know to
if<00:04:38.410> they<00:04:38.590> don't<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.800> back<00:04:38.950> row<00:04:39.130> like<00:04:39.400> I

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
if they don't have back row like I

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.500
