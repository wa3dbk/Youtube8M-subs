 Desteni presents: Human History (35) Reincarnation and Karma - Jack - 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 Again Jack - let you know who is talking 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.690
 So - the reincarnation 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.970
 The reincarnation is also configured by Annu. 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.770
 Is part of the white light structure, part of the soul structure 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 So, you have a reincarnation structure, a white light structure, a soul structure. 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.060
 This is basically a trinity and is part of the entire "recycling (person)" situation. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.410
 Soul body and white light 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 Connected to Annu, existence, the universe, etc. 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.170
 So when you are here on Earth, you will be maintained in your pre-programmed, pre-determined life experience... 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.320
 Then you have a reincarnation 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.980
 Reincarnation is deliberate - managed by a specific person, in other words, as follows: 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.810
 You are dead, and you have about 70 past lives - before the world you just finished 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.820
 Now all the information is in your soul. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.550
 So what happened is: the moment you died 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.060
 There is a personal person who will (obviously) specifically put all your records in the so-called Akashic record - 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.010
 Basically engraving your entire life experience into a book 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.390
 And when you die, you will be led to this person. 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.870
 Now this is the (system) upgrade configuration they have configured, and this "authoritative configuration" will determine 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.070
 If you are not going to reincarnation, that is - being placed into the ascension-process 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.390
 Or you will choose to enter your own paradise, or go to other Milky Ways and exist on other planets. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.870
 Reincarnation into....well, and so on 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.940
 So, before you get to this person, it’s a pretty big person. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.580
 At the top of it there is something like this priest's preaching, and this huge book - 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.430
 Now, all the people who have had life on earth in their lives are recorded in the book. 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.050
 Then you go up to this person, and this person examines your life. 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.620
 And decide if you need to learn more "courses" 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.770
 Do you have a failed course? 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.880
 It’s all about the course, or the whole crap about karma. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.020
 It’s all nonsense; it’s part of the whole body of the soul. 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.750
 Leading to humans who believe that they must try to understand the "one point" of the world. 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.460
 Because they are "cracked up" in a previous life that they can't even remember. 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.520
 Why do they do that, how did they get there - and now they have to pay for it? 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.660
 By going to learn a course, on the surface, beyond that point 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.590
 This is full - forgive my words - it is really nonsense! 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.710
 I just can't believe it, you know, out of... I won't say that, don't mind. 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.360
 Therefore, karma, it is the actual body of karma 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.730
 The actualization of karma is another point; it is used to enslave human beings, to make them believe... they must be one after another 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 Trying to understand and "paying debts" for other past lives and learning lessons - 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.090
 If they didn’t learn in this world, they must go to the next, next, next generation. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.100
 do you know? Some people have lived on Earth for a thousand years and still can't go beyond that. 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.800
 Why? Because that is how Annunakis enslaved humans: making them believe that they must learn the course 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.820
 Believe that they have to pay their debts, in order to be superficial... a past life - they are messed up in it 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.360
 And then to compensate - and to "make it right in other worlds" 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.590
 All put in consideration: your karma - 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.480
 This decision is based on karma 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.170
 So let's bring this to you: you are decided to go to reincarnation, and you - led by your "leader" 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.050
 The "guardian" on your surface - 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.260
 But your "guardian" is to make sure you 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.920
 This you...equate a human being will remain in your "slavery" and pre-programmed...existence/life...experience 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.220
 You are taken to a person 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.450
 This person has configured six boards. 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:01.340
 It looks transparent, but then they are placed into six different families 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.180
 You can choose from six families 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.080
 You have a choice - some people will have a choice, depending on how good and "worthy" your past lives are. 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.240
 They placed the six families, and now they can crap, like: 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.730
 You will enter this family to "save marriage", this is your goal - 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:31.510
 Or: This mother needs you, she is so lonely, her husband left her, you will be her lover! 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.910
 You know, they give meaning to a form of reincarnation - for a family 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.630
 And then you can choose the family you want to give birth to. 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.280
 And then you pick one, then they send you to that particular woman. 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.220
 They first configure you to enter - like a box 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.840
 That exists on the mother's back 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.060
 Above the hips 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.930
 Restricted there, the small box you were placed in 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.770
 And about six weeks later - about, maybe less - 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.160
 You will go in and merge into - already developed in the mother's womb - baby 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.590
 But recently it has gotten worse 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.820
 It's already - not worse 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.030
 At birth - the situation of system integration is more serious than the old one - 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:35.210
 But the current situation is that people will integrate into the baby at the moment of conception: then you sprout like a flower 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.150
 Birds and bees... 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.330
 Just telling a joke 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.630
 Therefore, this is the process of reincarnation, and the process of reincarnation has been automated. 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.070
 Remember now - 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:55.780
 All the people in the dimensional space are programmed by Annu (the head) 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.970
 And he has always been... ready to know what’s going on 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.490
 Although he has power and domination in the dimensional space group 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.850
 His power and domination on the earth - is equivalent to the mental consciousness system within human beings 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.400
 And this white light, the soul structure and the reincarnation process; 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.730
 This is all his and equal to him. 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.160
 What else...hey, so this is how the reincarnation works. 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
 This is Jack, thank you.
