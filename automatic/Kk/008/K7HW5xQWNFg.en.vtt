siphoning strikes that would piss me off

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280 
siphoning strikes that would piss me off
so<00:00:32.940> much<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

we're going to start this thing and

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.630 
we're going to start this thing and
there<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.079> go<00:00:37.200> once<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.280> thing<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> done

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
between life-saving strike that gay sure

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.770 
between life-saving strike that gay sure
I<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> only<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.750> canter<00:01:08.540> there<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> go

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I can only get one canter there you go

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
I can only get one canter there you go
oh<00:01:10.280> yeah<00:01:11.280> Spirit<00:01:11.670> fire

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.130 

just<00:01:21.369> keeping<00:01:21.670> himself<00:01:21.789> up<00:01:22.240> nicely<00:01:22.539> with<00:01:22.810> his

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
just keeping himself up nicely with his

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.810 
just keeping himself up nicely with his
region<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:26.409> get<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.979> guess<00:01:27.640> I'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
region will get it I guess I'm

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.399 
region will get it I guess I'm
sacrificing<00:01:28.030> speed<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.659> bit<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.990> make<00:01:29.140> sure<00:01:29.200> I

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
sacrificing speed a bit to make sure I

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.130 
sacrificing speed a bit to make sure I
get<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.820> proper<00:01:31.179> siphoning<00:01:31.569> strike<00:01:31.840> stuff

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
get the proper siphoning strike stuff

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
get the proper siphoning strike stuff
but<00:01:34.140> guilt<00:01:36.240> 18<00:01:37.240> stacks<00:01:37.569> it's<00:01:37.810> quite<00:01:37.990> nice

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.969 

that's<00:01:46.869> yeah<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.530> definitely<00:01:47.799> the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
that's yeah one of the definitely the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.459 
that's yeah one of the definitely the
slower<00:01:48.310> junglers<00:01:48.819> so<00:01:49.479> far<00:01:49.750> but<00:01:49.929> he's<00:01:50.049> really

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
slower junglers so far but he's really

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.880 
slower junglers so far but he's really
healthy<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.329> yeah<00:01:52.329> I'm<00:01:52.539> I'm<00:01:53.229> obsessing<00:01:53.829> over

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
healthy and yeah I'm I'm obsessing over

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.609 
healthy and yeah I'm I'm obsessing over
siphoning<00:01:54.459> strike<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.329> mean<00:01:58.659> you're<00:01:59.020> it's

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
siphoning strike so I mean you're it's

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.499 
siphoning strike so I mean you're it's
up<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.280> sacrifice<00:02:00.729> siphoning

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
up to you you can sacrifice siphoning

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.020 
up to you you can sacrifice siphoning
strike<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:01.929> do<00:02:01.989> it<00:02:02.079> slightly<00:02:02.319> faster<00:02:02.649> or<00:02:03.130> what

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
strike and do it slightly faster or what

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.729 
strike and do it slightly faster or what
probably<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.689> going<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.929> end<00:02:05.049> up<00:02:05.110> being<00:02:05.439> I

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
probably is going to end up being I

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.219 
probably is going to end up being I
suspect<00:02:06.220> maybe<00:02:06.429> average<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.509> slightly<00:02:07.539> slower

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
suspect maybe average to slightly slower

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.150 
suspect maybe average to slightly slower
than<00:02:08.380> average<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:13.410> there's<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.590> pot<00:02:14.860> cup<00:02:15.040> of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
than average do there's not a pot cup of

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:36.510 
than average do there's not a pot cup of
can<00:02:22.799> grab<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> harsh

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:49.350 

oh<00:02:45.090> man<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.550> four<00:02:48.790> minutes<00:02:49.180> we're

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
oh man I don't the four minutes we're

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.550 
oh man I don't the four minutes we're
probably<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.810> end<00:02:49.840> up<00:02:49.960> being<00:02:50.200> at<00:02:50.380> four

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
probably going to end up being at four

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.900 
probably going to end up being at four
minutes<00:02:50.800> 20<00:02:51.070> seconds<00:02:51.400> which<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.820> the

minutes 20 seconds which is one of the
slower<00:02:52.210> guys<00:02:52.450> but<00:02:52.750> that's<00:02:52.810> fine<00:02:53.020> oh<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:01.420> missed

faster you know the more siphoning
strike<00:03:39.610> stuff<00:03:39.880> i<00:03:40.060> had<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:40.959> stacks<00:03:41.440> up

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
strike stuff i had so that stacks up

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.790 
strike stuff i had so that stacks up
quite<00:03:42.070> easily<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:44.050> can<00:03:44.200> kind<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.410> extrapolate

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
quite easily you can kind of extrapolate

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.410 
quite easily you can kind of extrapolate
into<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> future<00:03:45.490> how<00:03:45.730> fast<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.240> would

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
into the future how fast that would

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.180 
into the future how fast that would
stack<00:03:46.660> up<00:03:46.690> if<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.990> keep<00:03:47.170> farming<00:03:47.590> nothing<00:03:48.010> but

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
stack up if you keep farming nothing but

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.740 
stack up if you keep farming nothing but
the<00:03:48.280> jungle<00:03:48.490> but<00:03:49.150> there<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.570> have<00:03:49.630> it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
the jungle but there you have it

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.260 
the jungle but there you have it
slightly<00:03:50.290> on<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.620> slow<00:03:50.890> end<00:03:51.040> while<00:03:51.670> obsessing

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
slightly on the slow end while obsessing

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.510 
slightly on the slow end while obsessing
over<00:03:52.330> siphoning<00:03:52.840> strike<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.370> guys
