00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
of the window but so yeah it was just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210 
be afraid of I was really nervous I
guess<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> norm<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.950> Sephora

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
guess that is like the norm for Sephora

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
guess that is like the norm for Sephora
for<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.640> first<00:01:29.850> interview<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> group<00:01:30.840> one

mine was individual I guess that was

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270
