00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.410 
repeating this process until the poles
are<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.930> out

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.149 

the<00:02:04.420> next<00:02:04.690> thing<00:02:04.840> we<00:02:04.930> need<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> do<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.710> work<00:02:05.979> out

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
the next thing we need to do is work out

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.370 
the next thing we need to do is work out
how<00:02:06.460> many<00:02:06.520> times<00:02:06.880> wider<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.510> tent<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.960> than

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
how many times wider the tent is than

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.620 
how many times wider the tent is than
the<00:02:08.590> carry<00:02:08.800> bag<00:02:09.009> once<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.060> know<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.240> we

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the carry bag once we know that we

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.960 
the carry bag once we know that we
simply<00:02:11.200> fold<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.860> tent<00:02:12.130> into<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.640> long<00:02:12.940> thin

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
simply fold the tent into a long thin

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:29.370 
simply fold the tent into a long thin
strip<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.170> same<00:02:14.440> width<00:02:14.680> as<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.370> bag<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:29.350> next

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
strip the same width as the bag the next

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.370 
strip the same width as the bag the next
thing<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.800> need<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.940> take<00:02:31.209> your<00:02:31.450> pole

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380
