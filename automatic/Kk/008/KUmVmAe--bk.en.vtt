compiling<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.680> time<00:04:45.979> or<00:04:46.280> our<00:04:46.550> applications

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
compiling it's time or our applications

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.089 
compiling it's time or our applications
it's<00:04:47.419> time<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.780> launch<00:04:47.900> open<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.860> level

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
it's time to launch open the level

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.730 
it's time to launch open the level
editor<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.789> click<00:04:50.060> on<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.300> button<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.930> give

editor so click on that button and give

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.870 
editor so click on that button and give
it<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.889> moment<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.250> see<00:04:52.430> it's<00:04:52.580> starting<00:04:52.849> to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
it a moment you see it's starting to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.999 
it a moment you see it's starting to
load<00:04:53.120> up<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.509> for<00:04:54.259> those<00:04:54.349> of<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.800> have

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
load up and for those of you that have

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.499 
load up and for those of you that have
mapped<00:04:55.220> for<00:04:55.460> Call<00:04:55.639> of<00:04:55.669> Duty<00:04:55.940> before<00:04:56.210> we'll<00:04:56.389> say

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
mapped for Call of Duty before we'll say

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.779 
mapped for Call of Duty before we'll say
hey<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.930> know<00:04:57.139> this<00:04:57.380> this<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.710> radium<00:04:58.160> yeah<00:04:58.610> it

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
hey I know this this is radium yeah it

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.300 
hey I know this this is radium yeah it
is<00:04:59.169> so<00:05:00.169> it's<00:05:00.289> gonna<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.530> very<00:05:00.710> familiar<00:05:00.919> for

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
is so it's gonna be very familiar for

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.710 
is so it's gonna be very familiar for
you<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.460> work<00:05:01.699> with<00:05:01.729> in<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.210> editor<00:05:02.539> if

you to work with in this editor if
you've<00:05:03.020> already<00:05:03.199> done<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:03.620> before<00:05:05.050> now<00:05:06.050> quick

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
you've already done so before now quick

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.399 
you've already done so before now quick
rundown<00:05:06.680> on<00:05:07.039> what<00:05:07.250> we're<00:05:07.430> looking<00:05:07.729> at<00:05:07.849> here<00:05:08.090> is

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
rundown on what we're looking at here is

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.260 
rundown on what we're looking at here is
obviously<00:05:09.409> we<00:05:09.530> have<00:05:09.620> our<00:05:09.650> menus<00:05:10.039> and<00:05:10.220> tools<00:05:10.460> we

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
obviously we have our menus and tools we

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.620 
obviously we have our menus and tools we
have<00:05:11.539> our<00:05:12.020> 2d<00:05:12.860> window<00:05:13.250> now<00:05:14.030> remember<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.419> game

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
have our 2d window now remember the game

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.620 
have our 2d window now remember the game
runs<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.139> three<00:05:15.440> dimensions<00:05:15.889> 3d<00:05:16.400> that's<00:05:17.090> left

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
runs in three dimensions 3d that's left

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.740 
runs in three dimensions 3d that's left
right<00:05:17.900> forward<00:05:18.319> back<00:05:18.349> up<00:05:18.710> down<00:05:19.449> but<00:05:20.449> we<00:05:20.539> can't

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
right forward back up down but we can't

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.899 
right forward back up down but we can't
necessarily<00:05:21.050> instantly<00:05:21.949> map<00:05:22.190> in<00:05:22.370> all<00:05:22.580> those

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
necessarily instantly map in all those

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:23.860 
necessarily instantly map in all those
directions<00:05:23.240> at<00:05:23.539> once

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
directions at once

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.140 
directions at once
so<00:05:24.319> presents<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.979> us<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.280> two<00:05:25.669> dimensions

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
so presents it to us in two dimensions

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.610 
so presents it to us in two dimensions
at<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> time<00:05:26.539> sort<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.139> piece<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.500> paper

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
at a time sort of like a piece of paper

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.640 
at a time sort of like a piece of paper
and<00:05:27.919> grid<00:05:28.759> work<00:05:28.909> so<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.210> can<00:05:29.569> work<00:05:30.289> on<00:05:30.440> this

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
and grid work so I can work on this

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.350 
and grid work so I can work on this
dimension<00:05:31.159> and<00:05:31.310> then<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.520> can<00:05:31.699> work<00:05:31.729> on<00:05:31.970> others

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
dimension and then I can work on others

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.730 
dimension and then I can work on others
which<00:05:32.599> I'll<00:05:32.750> show<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:32.930> later<00:05:33.110> how<00:05:33.259> to<00:05:33.440> flip

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
which I'll show you later how to flip

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.980 
which I'll show you later how to flip
back<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.130> forth<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:35.180> we<00:05:35.270> don't<00:05:35.419> even<00:05:35.599> have<00:05:35.780> to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
back and forth but we don't even have to

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.839 
back and forth but we don't even have to
in<00:05:36.229> most<00:05:36.409> cases<00:05:36.530> because<00:05:37.039> right<00:05:37.340> here<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.729> our

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
in most cases because right here is our

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.629 
in most cases because right here is our
third<00:05:38.060> dimension<00:05:38.479> our<00:05:38.630> z<00:05:39.080> window<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:40.340> we<00:05:40.460> have

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
third dimension our z window so we have

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.899 
third dimension our z window so we have
x<00:05:40.909> y<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.479> z<00:05:42.550> those<00:05:43.550> are<00:05:43.639> your<00:05:43.759> three

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
x y and z those are your three

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.089 
x y and z those are your three
dimensions<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:44.780> over<00:05:45.020> here<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.469> 3d

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
dimensions now over here is a 3d

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.939 
dimensions now over here is a 3d
previewer<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.030> this<00:05:47.180> shows<00:05:47.360> us<00:05:47.539> all<00:05:47.690> 3d<00:05:48.289> all

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
previewer so this shows us all 3d all

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.430 
previewer so this shows us all 3d all
three<00:05:49.460> dimensions<00:05:50.240> at<00:05:50.360> once<00:05:50.539> so<00:05:50.750> we<00:05:50.780> can<00:05:50.990> kind

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
three dimensions at once so we can kind

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.719 
three dimensions at once so we can kind
of<00:05:51.469> get<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.680> rough<00:05:51.860> idea<00:05:52.159> of<00:05:52.190> what<00:05:52.340> our<00:05:52.460> level

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
of get a rough idea of what our level

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:53.980 
of get a rough idea of what our level
looks<00:05:52.880> like<00:05:53.060> before<00:05:53.240> we<00:05:53.449> actually<00:05:53.599> start

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
looks like before we actually start

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.930 
looks like before we actually start
playing<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:55.250> over<00:05:55.460> here<00:05:55.639> we<00:05:55.729> have<00:05:55.759> the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
playing it and over here we have the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.550 
playing it and over here we have the
textures<00:05:56.449> these<00:05:56.659> are<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.900> images<00:05:57.289> we<00:05:57.440> can

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
textures these are the images we can

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.439 
textures these are the images we can
apply<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.830> walls<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.550> other<00:05:58.669> surfaces<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.360> the

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
apply to walls and other surfaces in the

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.930 
apply to walls and other surfaces in the
game<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.780> make<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.110> look<00:06:00.229> like<00:06:00.349> a<00:06:00.409> level<00:06:00.759> now<00:06:01.759> if

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
game to make it look like a level now if

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.370 
game to make it look like a level now if
the<00:06:02.090> if<00:06:02.240> when<00:06:02.449> you<00:06:02.539> open<00:06:02.569> this<00:06:02.930> up<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:03.259> you

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
the if when you open this up and you

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.950 
the if when you open this up and you
find<00:06:03.590> it<00:06:03.740> running<00:06:04.039> kind<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.310> slow<00:06:04.840> perhaps<00:06:05.840> you

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
find it running kind of slow perhaps you

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.450 
find it running kind of slow perhaps you
want<00:06:06.139> to<00:06:06.169> reduce<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.889> amount<00:06:07.069> of<00:06:07.159> information

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
want to reduce the amount of information

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.370 
want to reduce the amount of information
that's<00:06:07.819> being<00:06:08.060> drawn<00:06:08.449> by<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.750> textures

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
that's being drawn by the textures

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.170 
that's being drawn by the textures
themselves<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:10.130> you<00:06:10.669> can<00:06:10.819> do<00:06:10.909> that<00:06:11.030> very

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
themselves and you can do that very

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.969 
themselves and you can do that very
quickly<00:06:11.389> by<00:06:11.780> going<00:06:11.990> up<00:06:12.110> into<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.409> textures

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
quickly by going up into the textures

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.059 
quickly by going up into the textures
menu<00:06:13.250> here<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.719> going<00:06:14.719> down<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.870> now<00:06:15.680> what<00:06:15.889> was

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
menu here and going down to now what was

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.680 
menu here and going down to now what was
that<00:06:16.099> it<00:06:16.520> was<00:06:16.610> texture<00:06:16.940> resolution<00:06:17.060> we<00:06:17.539> can

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
that it was texture resolution we can

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.089 
that it was texture resolution we can
change<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:18.080> resolution<00:06:18.259> of<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.800> images

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099

change the resolution of the images
being<00:06:19.340> loaded<00:06:19.460> I'd<00:06:20.300> seven<00:06:20.690> unnormal<00:06:21.050> but<00:06:21.199> you

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
being loaded I'd seven unnormal but you

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.170 
being loaded I'd seven unnormal but you
can<00:06:21.380> switch<00:06:21.590> to<00:06:21.620> low<00:06:21.979> if<00:06:22.099> you<00:06:22.219> want<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.639> then

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
can switch to low if you want and then

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.550 
can switch to low if you want and then
you<00:06:23.240> can<00:06:23.389> also<00:06:23.509> change<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:24.050> wind<00:06:24.229> of<00:06:24.440> the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
you can also change the wind of the

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.529 
you can also change the wind of the
texture<00:06:24.919> window<00:06:25.190> scale<00:06:25.460> now<00:06:26.000> by<00:06:26.120> default

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
texture window scale now by default

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.629 
texture window scale now by default
you'll<00:06:26.690> probably<00:06:26.840> already<00:06:27.110> see<00:06:27.409> 50%<00:06:27.979> these

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
you'll probably already see 50% these

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.459 
you'll probably already see 50% these
big<00:06:28.849> images<00:06:29.240> but<00:06:29.810> I'd<00:06:29.900> like<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.110> be<00:06:30.259> able<00:06:30.349> to

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
big images but I'd like to be able to

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.200 
big images but I'd like to be able to
see<00:06:30.650> more<00:06:30.889> of<00:06:31.039> my<00:06:31.159> textures<00:06:31.550> at<00:06:31.699> once<00:06:31.880> so<00:06:32.060> I'm

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
see more of my textures at once so I'm

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.149 
see more of my textures at once so I'm
gonna<00:06:32.330> go<00:06:32.539> into<00:06:32.719> here<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:33.229> change<00:06:33.469> back<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.680> 25

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
gonna go into here and change back to 25

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.120 
gonna go into here and change back to 25
so<00:06:34.789> I<00:06:34.819> can<00:06:35.000> see<00:06:35.240> more<00:06:35.479> and<00:06:35.750> it's<00:06:36.740> easier<00:06:37.009> to

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
so I can see more and it's easier to

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.680 
so I can see more and it's easier to
find<00:06:37.310> them<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.580> just<00:06:37.759> pop<00:06:38.210> them<00:06:38.389> into<00:06:38.599> the

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
find them and just pop them into the

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.379 
find them and just pop them into the
game<00:06:39.039> now<00:06:40.039> now<00:06:40.490> you<00:06:40.550> have<00:06:40.760> a<00:06:40.789> rough<00:06:41.000> idea<00:06:41.330> of

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
game now now you have a rough idea of

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.659 
game now now you have a rough idea of
what<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.630> editor<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:41.990> like<00:06:42.169> and<00:06:42.710> now<00:06:42.949> what<00:06:43.550> we

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
what the editor is like and now what we

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.890 
what the editor is like and now what we
want<00:06:43.699> to<00:06:43.909> do<00:06:43.969> is<00:06:44.089> we<00:06:44.180> want<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.360> select<00:06:44.659> our

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
want to do is we want to select our

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.219 
want to do is we want to select our
base<00:06:45.080> texture<00:06:45.800> for<00:06:46.550> creating<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.419> level<00:06:47.720> now

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
base texture for creating the level now

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.409 
base texture for creating the level now
base<00:06:48.440> texture<00:06:48.800> is<00:06:48.979> something<00:06:49.310> that<00:06:49.460> should<00:06:50.389> be

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
base texture is something that should be

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.820 
base texture is something that should be
used<00:06:50.720> whenever<00:06:50.960> you're<00:06:51.229> creating<00:06:51.350> all<00:06:51.680> your

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
used whenever you're creating all your

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.860 
used whenever you're creating all your
levels<00:06:52.130> it<00:06:52.639> is<00:06:52.759> a<00:06:52.910> texture<00:06:53.360> that<00:06:53.509> does<00:06:53.690> not

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
levels it is a texture that does not

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.100 
levels it is a texture that does not
require<00:06:54.740> a<00:06:55.009> lot<00:06:55.310> of<00:06:55.340> resources<00:06:55.660> when<00:06:56.660> loading

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
require a lot of resources when loading

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.330 
require a lot of resources when loading
in<00:06:57.199> the<00:06:57.289> game<00:06:57.470> and<00:06:57.710> that's<00:06:57.889> important<00:06:58.310> because

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
in the game and that's important because

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.520 
in the game and that's important because
let's<00:06:58.789> say<00:06:58.850> you<00:06:58.970> create<00:06:59.330> a<00:06:59.360> wall<00:06:59.570> and<00:06:59.810> no<00:07:00.139> plan

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
let's say you create a wall and no plan

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.840 
let's say you create a wall and no plan
the<00:07:00.620> player<00:07:00.770> never<00:07:01.070> sees<00:07:01.340> the<00:07:01.370> other<00:07:01.580> side<00:07:01.759> of

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
the player never sees the other side of

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.779 
the player never sees the other side of
the<00:07:01.910> wall<00:07:02.030> well<00:07:02.840> that<00:07:03.160> would<00:07:04.160> be<00:07:04.190> a<00:07:04.310> waste<00:07:04.550> to

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
the wall well that would be a waste to

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.129 
the wall well that would be a waste to
load<00:07:04.910> the<00:07:05.030> texture<00:07:05.419> on<00:07:05.449> that<00:07:05.750> other<00:07:05.840> side<00:07:05.960> of

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
load the texture on that other side of

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.390 
load the texture on that other side of
the<00:07:06.259> wall<00:07:06.410> because<00:07:06.740> the<00:07:06.830> player<00:07:06.979> never<00:07:07.130> sees

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
the wall because the player never sees

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.340 
the wall because the player never sees
it<00:07:07.430> so<00:07:08.000> we<00:07:08.090> want<00:07:08.270> a<00:07:08.330> base<00:07:08.539> texture<00:07:08.930> something

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
it so we want a base texture something

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.730 
it so we want a base texture something
that<00:07:10.630> doesn't<00:07:11.630> take<00:07:11.750> up<00:07:11.870> any<00:07:11.990> additional

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
that doesn't take up any additional

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.010 
that doesn't take up any additional
resources<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.430> in<00:07:13.940> this<00:07:14.060> case<00:07:14.330> that<00:07:14.750> base

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
resources and in this case that base

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.529 
resources and in this case that base
texture<00:07:15.410> is<00:07:15.620> called<00:07:15.889> the<00:07:16.070> caulk<00:07:16.430> texture<00:07:17.180> and

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
texture is called the caulk texture and

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:18.969 
texture is called the caulk texture and
I'm<00:07:18.110> going<00:07:18.229> to<00:07:18.260> show<00:07:18.380> you<00:07:18.470> how<00:07:18.590> to<00:07:18.620> find<00:07:18.830> it

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:18.979 
I'm going to show you how to find it

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:20.290 
I'm going to show you how to find it
because<00:07:19.310> looking<00:07:19.850> through<00:07:20.060> all<00:07:20.180> these

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
because looking through all these

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.200 
because looking through all these
textures<00:07:21.610> it's<00:07:22.610> going<00:07:22.760> to<00:07:22.820> get<00:07:22.940> kind<00:07:23.090> of

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
textures it's going to get kind of

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.300 
textures it's going to get kind of
difficult<00:07:23.630> so<00:07:24.470> what<00:07:24.620> you<00:07:24.710> want<00:07:24.860> to<00:07:24.889> do<00:07:25.039> is<00:07:25.190> you

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
difficult so what you want to do is you

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.450 
difficult so what you want to do is you
want<00:07:25.520> to<00:07:25.840> redo<00:07:26.840> you<00:07:27.110> want<00:07:27.260> to<00:07:27.380> narrow<00:07:28.370> your

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
want to redo you want to narrow your

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.270 
want to redo you want to narrow your
your<00:07:29.120> your<00:07:29.870> selection<00:07:30.320> here<00:07:30.350> so<00:07:31.010> I'm<00:07:31.100> going<00:07:31.190> to

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
your your selection here so I'm going to
