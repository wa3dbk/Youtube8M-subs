 friol more precisely talk how to play 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 in amapÃ¡ was the focus of multiplayer mode 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.619
 without prior and moves is because football 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 for those who do not know that map that came 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 As a bonus, I think it's worse. 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.930
 I think a lot of you the vast majority 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 of you must have bought the heat of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.399
 goals at the premier and must have received the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 fifolk map download code by 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.059
 some people who bought after 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 they even got their 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 copies with soccer 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.039
 just as happened in the past in the block 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 2 connect 2025 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.780
 however fifa or non-rotating map 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 on the 5th bpm common playlists 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 I have dominated chan that at last I do not 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 is in these playlists only that it has a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 playlist in exclusive codes for who 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.550
 did the test of the game where the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 free fall sure you'll go in there and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.140
 seek the match enters the policy 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.780
 standard and down there time he estimated the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.119
 pitbulls sure this playlist is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 running the way blitz dominated chan and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 it is certain re-written and a map was missing 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 included in the vote because that is the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 the only policy of the game so far where 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210
 you can play for fifa and few people 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 You know that a lot of people asking me 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.530
 Why did I miss a vote? 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.650
 specific propofol allocation only then 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.909
 in this plant called the right pits goals 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 so this is the only way to play a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 shovel a free map for now 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 I know if they intend to introduced fauna 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.700
 the other girls something else in the future 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 It's obvious that I do not think only when 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 they released general slack as well as 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.070
 athlete who did last year with the new 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.390
 line 25 I believe they will do 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
 being with the football 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.860
 hence it should start running at all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 playlists on a pen if it's me 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.460
 I got to play with that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.619
 the granting of funds in full 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.630
 waterlogged fail playboy still in 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.579
 because it's very light even for 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 Playing then I'm even making an invitation. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.640
 For you guys try playing this girl. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 pitbulls to see if we think 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.729
 matches with br 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 including the pc and the pc i could not 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.299
 find matches with 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.159
 I also tried this question even on PC 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.900
 and so I get a good start and 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.549
 I got to play better on this map. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.379
 know the map better I bring a video 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.939
 just to talk about it that is very 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.400
 small and it's very easy to lose it is 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.349
 smaller than the tracks where it is a map 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.939
 throughout the entire complex full of entries 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.230
 but still until I liked it 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.549
 let's wait have to play more 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.780
 give a final opinion and so I 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.400
 I got a video for you 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.049
 Today's todd company cover was this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 I hope you liked it if you liked it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.590
 Do not want to leave your home and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.250
 favorite and I'm staying here with 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.790
 one piece everybody stay with god and until the
