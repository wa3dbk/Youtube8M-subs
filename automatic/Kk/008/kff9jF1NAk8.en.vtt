North America coming out at the lid but
for<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.259> reason<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> UK<00:01:38.150> not

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
for some reason the one from the UK not

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.749 
for some reason the one from the UK not
a<00:01:39.329> smart<00:01:39.780> move<00:01:40.790> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.570> lid<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.310> big<00:01:44.490> salt

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a smart move on the lid and the big salt

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
a smart move on the lid and the big salt
crystals<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.990> don't<00:01:46.259> even<00:01:46.470> come<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:47.240> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
crystals that don't even come out that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.630 
crystals that don't even come out that
is<00:01:48.450> why<00:01:50.270> my<00:01:51.270> rap<00:01:51.479> rap<00:01:51.659> rap<00:01:51.899> from<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> UK<00:01:52.640> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
is why my rap rap rap from the UK is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.929 
is why my rap rap rap from the UK is
practically<00:01:54.540> still<00:01:54.840> full<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> how

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
practically still full so this is how

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
practically still full so this is how
the<00:01:57.000> new<00:01:57.840> rub<00:01:58.140> rub<00:01:58.350> rub<00:01:58.439> looks<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the new rub rub rub looks like in the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.330 
the new rub rub rub looks like in the
tub<00:02:00.320> look<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.950> watery<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.979> reason

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
tub look at it it's so watery the reason

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.399 
tub look at it it's so watery the reason
why<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.060> watery<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
why it's so watery is because all the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.160 
why it's so watery is because all the
salt<00:02:07.680> settles<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> bottom<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
salt settles to the bottom so I have a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.260 
salt settles to the bottom so I have a
crap<00:02:10.709> stick

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
crap stick

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.680 
crap stick
and<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> I'm<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.070> gonna<00:02:16.190> mix<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.730> okay<00:02:17.570> I'm
