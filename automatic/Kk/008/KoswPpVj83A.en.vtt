okay<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.140> we've<00:00:07.500> got<00:00:07.680> five<00:00:07.919> mil<00:00:08.189> n<00:00:08.340> survive<00:00:08.670> in

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
okay so we've got five mil n survive in

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.980 
okay so we've got five mil n survive in
London<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.240> addition<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> three<00:00:09.809> new

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.890 

that's<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.670> update<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.269> previous<00:01:05.750> one

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
that's the update on the previous one

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.480 
that's the update on the previous one
what's<00:01:06.110> changed<00:01:06.470> from<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.130> old<00:01:07.250> sense

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
what's changed from the the old sense

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.090 
what's changed from the the old sense
200<00:01:08.060> only<00:01:08.750> what's<00:01:09.200> changing<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.710> old<00:01:09.860> sense

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
200 only what's changing the old sense

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.120 
200 only what's changing the old sense
to<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.290> lady<00:01:12.290> yeah<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.950> big<00:01:13.100> thing

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
to the lady yeah that's the big thing

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.640 
to the lady yeah that's the big thing
exactly<00:01:13.820> right<00:01:14.120> also<00:01:14.750> in<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:14.930> full<00:01:15.110> frame<00:01:15.380> is

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
exactly right also in the full frame is

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.359 
exactly right also in the full frame is
the<00:01:15.979> new<00:01:16.130> 50<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.970> 500<00:01:17.860> also<00:01:18.860> optically

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the new 50 to 500 also optically

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.600 
the new 50 to 500 also optically
stabilized<00:01:19.910> now<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.800> aperture<00:01:22.160> range<00:01:22.369> on

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
stabilized now the aperture range on

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.760 
stabilized now the aperture range on
this<00:01:22.760> is<00:01:23.000> f<00:01:23.270> four<00:01:23.540> point<00:01:23.810> five<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.290> six<00:01:24.500> point

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
this is f four point five to six point

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
this is f four point five to six point
three<00:01:25.119> it's<00:01:26.119> an<00:01:26.210> appo<00:01:26.540> design

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

1.5<00:01:32.259> x<00:01:32.439> crop<00:01:33.149> format<00:01:34.149> we've<00:01:34.390> got<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:34.990> got<00:01:35.140> to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
1.5 x crop format we've got so we got to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.700 
1.5 x crop format we've got so we got to
two<00:01:35.799> other<00:01:35.979> zooms<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:37.000> one<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.509> 17<00:01:38.170> 250

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
two other zooms this one is a 17 250

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.389 
two other zooms this one is a 17 250
also<00:01:39.189> optically<00:01:39.580> stabilized<00:01:40.210> with<00:01:41.399> an
