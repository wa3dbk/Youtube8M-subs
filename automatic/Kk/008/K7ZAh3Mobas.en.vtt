00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.429
 hi everyone is christian causse who toned today on channel 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.169
 j a new name of who to hold 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.339
 tear everything 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.529
 the tonic p'tite with which chris 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.439
 I explain it's very simple 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.890
 we start we will do both arms forward of course we bring back 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 we bend the forearms 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.330
 and allow you to the forearm 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.450
 for now it's quite simple after three pillars the handles and we're going 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.020
 to say that with tang 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.510
 with his men in arms 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.960
 we will come here 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.120
 we close rectangle 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.200
 we close and wave curve caution 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.130
 and for the wave one raises 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.100
 and the wave that ends is no longer 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 we start again here here arms extended we do not bring here here here here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520
 simply curve 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.530
 to start all over again it's gone 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.590
 5 6 this 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 8 again 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.630
 2 with me 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.990
 3 4 5 6 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 however they are third parties 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.910
 why tur 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.850
 we go for each movement here 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.329
 well contracted and then to lock the handles to have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.230
 geometric shapes 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.260
 and unlike the just after 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.689
 we will release for the wave 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.900
 simply that he contracted 0 8% my movements for the form 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.019
 geometric here 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.569
 alas to let go 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.149
 for the race to the fact that is worth 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.149
 he found the door all together all together 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.209
 it is a progression that pays is very simple 33 we find ourselves very 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.560
 quickly on channel j and channel j point fr 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.849
 for new worlds titanic go bailly
