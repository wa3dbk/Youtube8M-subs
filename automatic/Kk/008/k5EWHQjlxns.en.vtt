00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.510
 the library network of fenalco 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.660
 antioquia joins the celebration of 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.760
 international day of the book in addition to 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.130
 pay tribute to gabriel garcía 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.390
 marquez the great teacher of letters 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.970
 Spanish for today is my wish and 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.789
 promote them to share five books 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.519
 that have been to my liking of this nobel 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.519
 and that I think with them you can 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.469
 start not only the road to 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.660
 good readings but also the 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.930
 knowledge to this genius of letters 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 Y 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.200
 the first book of course is 100 years 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.330
 of loneliness that is a kind of 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.570
 Biblical travel for a population 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:05.860
 call marking where you are born you live and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.870
 it disappears is one of the badges of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 universal literature 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.700
 compared to the quixote of the spot ' 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.870
 the second book is love in the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.050
 times of anger 'a book that 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.730
 wrote gabriel garcía marquez after 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.550
 of having won the Nobel Prize three 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.850
 years later and it's about the history of his 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.750
 dad and his mom in a persistent way 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.490
 to show how love has no end and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.490
 as it is almost infinite 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 the third book are the twelve stories 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.620
 pilgrims are some magisterial stories 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.450
 where there are some incredibly 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.150
 unlikely that they end up doing the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.510
 credible is by the way it tells 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.060
 for example the story of a woman who 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.620
 ends in a room in a sanatorium and that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 it's called just comes to speak for 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.750
 phone 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.000
 and one that for me is the best story that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.890
 there is gabriel garcía marquez that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.890
 call the trail of your blood in the snow 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.140
 the fourth book that I would like 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.950
 recommend them is the colonel has no 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.260
 who writes to you 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.620
 This is a gem of literature 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.709
 universal is a book that deals with the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.290
 he waited for the need and wrote it 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.180
 García Marquez in Paris when he was 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.700
 abandoned by the newspaper of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.069
 spectator because the dictatorship closed 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.680
 and then there while he waits for a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.080
 check to be able to live was writing 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.299
 this story of a waiting colonel 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.330
 his pension is one of the books with a 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.180
 final very interesting because in little 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.860
 few times a book ends with the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.860
 word that ends this book 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.520
 fifth book is the general in his 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.680
 labyrinth 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.320
 I recommend this book because it deals with 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.330
 history of Simon Bolivar the days of 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.290
 battle simón bolívar de simón 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.390
 bolivar 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.720
 and it's very important because the way 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.030
 like gabriel garcía marquez to the shaman or 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.610
 to his journalistic ability and his 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.320
 literary ability to achieve a 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.630
 memorable story of this great 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.510
 liberator of the americas the general in 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.140
 its labyrinth for it is the story of a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.250
 our hero that thanks to his 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:52.120
 persistence and their love affairs too 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.120
 he managed to create an ideal world for the fight 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.260
 a sixth book that no no they should not 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.370
 discard is chronic in death 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.820
 announced 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.490
 especially because there also d'esplai a 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.410
 him all his journalistic ability and 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.300
 that young people love this 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.790
 book that shows you from the beginning 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.290
 what will be the end of that book 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.200
 'Chronicle of an announced death ' 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.670
 lets you tell them that in the promotion of 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.430
 the reading 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.290
 the contents are very important and that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.420
 those contents not only do not 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.080
 only be of good aesthetic quality 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:35.220
 that is to say linguistic and that they are written 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.500
 in a rigorous and fervent way I would say 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.600
 I but it is also important that the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.480
 reader go having elements for 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.920
 can understand them and that is the magic of 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.410
 a writer like gabriel garcía marquez 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.570
 that got the elites to understand 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.150
 but also the masses understood it and 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.710
 that's why he is a writer who is 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.770
 they can read their works but not 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.900
 necessarily if we are readers who 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.510
 we are just beginning we would have to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.370
 strive with 100 years of loneliness 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.919
 we could start with 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.830
 as a chronicle of a death announced today 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.830
 and tomorrow with you with fenalco
