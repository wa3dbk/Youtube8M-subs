00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello youtube friend or friend in this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.629
 video tutorial I will teach you how to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.580
 download and install all the cars of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 gta san andreas except those of the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.960
 police because I did not find them but the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.389
 rest are all the cars carts and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 airplanes of the gta san andreas by the way 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.850
 I fucked up a lot because I had to download 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 the gt3 file point img and take them out one 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 to one and that's why I did not find those in the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 police but the rest will be good 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 let's start the first thing he's going to do is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.740
 download the file hundred percent 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.270
 uploaded by me and extract it where they want 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.270
 I recommend the desk 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.810
 well once extracted they see it if they want 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.230
 so they can see that there are all those 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.890
 I told them they are 195 in total without counting the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.890
 from the police 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.059
 the next step is to go to your al cisem 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.059
 editor axis 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.729
 then they go to the little tab that says file or 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.860
 also for the subnormal ones that says 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.860
 row and then they go to open and then they look for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 the file gta 3 point and m &amp; g that is in 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.140
 the models folder of his gta san andreas 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.690
 example gta san andreas models gta 3 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.479
 img points then select it with a 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.399
 just click and give it to open we hope to 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.330
 to load all the files of the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.330
 xd file 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.869
 after that they click on the arrow 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 green that points down too 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.579
 for the subnormal is the one that points 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 towards his xd cocks then they go to where 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.140
 they extracted the folder of the cars and the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.149
 they look inside the folder they select 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 all the files that are for the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.469
 they do not know those and they click on the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.569
 first file and then get down to the 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.819
 last and press the shift key that 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.189
 It is below the shift key and 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.289
 ready all the selected files and 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.579
