00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
suspect to be able to do 7 speeds but I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.430 
suspect to be able to do 7 speeds but I
can<00:02:09.679> prove<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.299> can<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:12.019> if

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
can prove here that you can because if

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.589 
can prove here that you can because if
you<00:02:12.530> look<00:02:12.709> at<00:02:12.829> my<00:02:12.920> freewheel<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.880> one

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
you look at my freewheel there is one

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.570 
you look at my freewheel there is one
two<00:02:14.750> three<00:02:14.780> four<00:02:14.930> five<00:02:15.230> six<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.620> seven<00:02:15.680> not

eight<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.660> does<00:02:17.870> work<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> course<00:02:19.099> I'm

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
eight it does work now of course I'm

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.970 
eight it does work now of course I'm
going<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.640> switched

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

freewill out to a 8-speed Sun race model

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.059 
freewill out to a 8-speed Sun race model
and<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.670> will<00:02:24.140> fit<00:02:25.140> right<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.590> because<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
and that will fit right in because of

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.440 
and that will fit right in because of
course<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.519> know<00:02:26.549> seven<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.090> eight<00:02:27.150> speed

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
course you know seven and eight speed

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.009 
course you know seven and eight speed
chains<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.409> same<00:02:28.590> width<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.360> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
chains are of the same width so that is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.770 
chains are of the same width so that is
how<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.379> compatible<00:02:32.180> doesn't<00:02:33.180> list<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.569> but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
how it's compatible doesn't list it but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.330 
how it's compatible doesn't list it but
just<00:02:34.019> remember<00:02:34.140> seven<00:02:34.769> eight<00:02:34.890> speed<00:02:35.069> chains

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
just remember seven eight speed chains

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.039 
just remember seven eight speed chains
are<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.519> same<00:02:35.790> nine<00:02:36.390> speeds<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> little

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
are the same nine speeds are a little

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.509 
are the same nine speeds are a little
narrower<00:02:37.319> ten<00:02:37.680> speeds<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.040> even<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> little

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
narrower ten speeds or even a little

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.920 
narrower ten speeds or even a little
narrower<00:02:38.790> than<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> x5

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
narrower than that but this is the x5

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
narrower than that but this is the x5
derailleur<00:02:42.930> great<00:02:43.680> little<00:02:44.150> mid-level

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
derailleur great little mid-level

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.720 
derailleur great little mid-level
derailleur<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> major<00:02:47.400> upgrade

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
derailleur that it was a major upgrade

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.479 
derailleur that it was a major upgrade
because<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.290> Mongoose<00:02:49.739> fever<00:02:50.129> and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
because this is the Mongoose fever and

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.610 
because this is the Mongoose fever and
you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.209> remember<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.049> look<00:02:52.200> at<00:02:52.319> back<00:02:52.470> at

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you can remember if you look at back at

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.650 
you can remember if you look at back at
my<00:02:52.739> other<00:02:52.950> video<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.640> paper<00:02:53.819> they<00:02:54.480> had<00:02:54.629> a

my other video of the paper they had a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690 
my other video of the paper they had a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
cheap Shimano derailleur on it which was

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390 
cheap Shimano derailleur on it which was
very<00:02:57.690> flexi<00:02:58.319> couldn't<00:02:58.799> get<00:02:58.920> consistent

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
very flexi couldn't get consistent

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
very flexi couldn't get consistent
performance<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> x5<00:03:00.599> was<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> major

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
performance and the x5 was a major

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.349 
performance and the x5 was a major
upgrade<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.859> that<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.609> that's<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.180> best

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
upgrade over that and that's the best

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.470 
upgrade over that and that's the best
