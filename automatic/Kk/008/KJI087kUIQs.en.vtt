00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
in experimenting with it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.920 
in experimenting with it
so<00:02:59.330> my<00:02:59.750> next<00:02:59.810> video<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.520> do<00:03:01.640> my<00:03:01.910> hair<00:03:02.210> I'll

kind<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.680> an<00:03:03.800> update<00:03:04.190> video<00:03:04.340> about<00:03:04.790> this

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
kind of have an update video about this

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.850 
kind of have an update video about this
style<00:03:05.270> like<00:03:05.540> how<00:03:05.750> long<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.140> lasts<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.650> what<00:03:06.830> I

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
style like how long it lasts it what I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.740 
style like how long it lasts it what I
had<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.250> do<00:03:07.400> at<00:03:07.730> night<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.300> know<00:03:08.390> did<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.660> have

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
had to do at night you know did I have

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.990 
had to do at night you know did I have
to<00:03:08.900> read<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.350> have<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.620> retwist<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.280> or

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
to read that I have to retwist it or

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.640 
to read that I have to retwist it or
could<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.210> just<00:03:11.390> put<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> bun<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:11.990> on<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.530> know

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
could I just put a bun in on it you know

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.810 
could I just put a bun in on it you know
so<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.820> actually<00:03:14.060> think<00:03:14.960> that<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:16.280> style

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
so and I actually think that the style

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.720 
so and I actually think that the style
like<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.630> way<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.960> turned<00:03:18.200> out<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.370> pretty

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
like the way it turned out it's pretty

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.230 
like the way it turned out it's pretty
similar<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.650> city<00:03:22.070> twist<00:03:22.520> front<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
similar to the city twist front of the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.510 
similar to the city twist front of the
damn<00:03:23.420> salon<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:24.290> don't<00:03:24.710> know<00:03:24.770> if<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.220> ladies

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
damn salon I don't know if you ladies

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.850 
damn salon I don't know if you ladies
are<00:03:25.670> familiar<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.470> actually

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
are familiar with that but I actually

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.410 
are familiar with that but I actually
think<00:03:28.100> they<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.310> theirs<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.670> little<00:03:28.790> shorter<00:03:29.300> at

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
think they do theirs a little shorter at

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.900 
think they do theirs a little shorter at
the<00:03:29.570> top<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.550> like<00:03:31.670> one

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the top and with this this is like one

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.180 
the top and with this this is like one
bag<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.330> hair<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.320> pulled<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.770> couple<00:03:33.980> of

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
bag of hair and I pulled a couple of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.690 
bag of hair and I pulled a couple of
strings<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> second<00:03:35.420> bag<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.700> that's

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
strings out of the second bag so that's

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.100 
strings out of the second bag so that's
that<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.890> will<00:03:40.670> let<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:40.910> guys<00:03:41.210> know<00:03:41.270> keep
