the<00:02:33.460> greatest<00:02:33.640> managers<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.240> my<00:02:34.420> opinion

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
the greatest managers in my opinion

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.410 
the greatest managers in my opinion
british<00:02:35.260> football<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.970> he<00:02:36.970> didn't<00:02:37.150> last<00:02:37.270> too

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
british football and he didn't last too

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.090 
british football and he didn't last too
long<00:02:37.480> at<00:02:37.690> leeds<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.170> there's<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.650> great<00:02:38.890> story

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
long at leeds and there's a great story

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.470 
long at leeds and there's a great story
because<00:02:39.460> they<00:02:39.580> were<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.820> successful<00:02:39.970> team

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
because they were really successful team

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.090 
because they were really successful team
in<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.750> era<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.410> didn't<00:02:41.620> quite<00:02:41.710> work<00:02:41.920> out

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
in that era and it didn't quite work out

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.290 
in that era and it didn't quite work out
for<00:02:42.310> him<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.550> i<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.690> author<00:02:43.840> gets<00:02:44.830> into

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
for him and i think the author gets into

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.430 
for him and i think the author gets into
the<00:02:46.300> character<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.660> brian<00:02:46.900> clough<00:02:47.110> really

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the character of brian clough really

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440

well<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.980> its<00:02:48.100> dark<00:02:48.310> side<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.270> lot<00:02:49.390> of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
well into its dark side and and a lot of

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.850 
well into its dark side and and a lot of
the<00:02:49.510> players<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.930> well<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> gives<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the players as well and it gives you

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.130 
the players as well and it gives you
views<00:02:51.430> from<00:02:51.580> both<00:02:51.640> sides<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.930> one<00:02:53.110> I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.930 
views from both sides and it's one I
really<00:02:53.440> enjoyed<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:54.160> can't<00:02:54.790> recommend
