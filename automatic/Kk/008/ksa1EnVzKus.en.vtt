going to do is going to wire this up in

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.519 
going to do is going to wire this up in
a<00:01:41.939> scenario<00:01:42.209> that<00:01:42.599> you<00:01:42.899> wouldn't<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> vehicle

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
a scenario that you wouldn't a vehicle

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.019 
a scenario that you wouldn't a vehicle
and<00:01:43.619> show<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.889> how<00:01:44.069> this<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.249> performs<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
and show you how this thing performs so

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:46.789 
and show you how this thing performs so
that<00:01:45.179> way<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.359> can<00:01:45.659> duplicate<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.709> if

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that way you can duplicate and see if

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.309 
that way you can duplicate and see if
this<00:01:46.919> is<00:01:47.069> what<00:01:47.219> you're<00:01:47.369> looking<00:01:47.459> for<00:01:47.819> if<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> is

that<00:01:56.819> one<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.059> well<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.239> here's<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.809> it<00:01:57.929> works

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
that one as well so here's how it works

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.409 
that one as well so here's how it works
your<00:01:59.130> blue<00:01:59.309> white<00:01:59.609> goes<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.029> the<00:02:00.059> blue<00:02:00.239> white

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:00.419 
your blue white goes to the blue white

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:01.819 
your blue white goes to the blue white
on<00:02:00.599> your<00:02:00.630> head<00:02:00.959> unit<00:02:01.229> from<00:02:01.349> your<00:02:01.469> Alpine

on your head unit from your Alpine

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
on your head unit from your Alpine
receiver<00:02:02.309> black<00:02:03.119> goes<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.389> constant<00:02:03.869> ground

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
receiver black goes to constant ground

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.529 
receiver black goes to constant ground
when<00:02:04.709> that's<00:02:04.919> done<00:02:05.329> that's<00:02:06.329> going<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
when that's done that's going to

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.879 
when that's done that's going to
energize<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.049> relay<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.559> it's<00:02:07.679> going<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
energize the relay and it's going to

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.919 
energize the relay and it's going to
throw<00:02:08.099> certain<00:02:09.030> voltages<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.659> on<00:02:09.810> these

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
throw certain voltages out on these

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.209 
throw certain voltages out on these
yellow<00:02:10.229> black<00:02:10.409> and<00:02:10.439> yellow<00:02:10.649> blue<00:02:10.979> which<00:02:11.129> I'm

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.219 
yellow black and yellow blue which I'm

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.990 
yellow black and yellow blue which I'm
going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> show<00:02:11.579> you<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.849> one<00:02:11.879> moment

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
going to show you in one moment

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.890 
going to show you in one moment
so<00:02:14.000> first<00:02:14.270> let<00:02:14.480> me<00:02:16.810> bring<00:02:17.810> on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> black

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
so first let me bring on the black

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.580 
so first let me bring on the black
actually<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.170> red<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:21.470> I'm<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.890> use

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
actually the red one I'm going to use

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.449 
actually the red one I'm going to use
actually<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.740> what<00:02:24.830> yes<00:02:24.950> oh<00:02:25.100> well<00:02:25.280> I'll

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
actually you know what yes oh well I'll

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.970 
actually you know what yes oh well I'll
use<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.709> could<00:02:27.709> do<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.950> couple

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
use that I could do this a couple

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580 
use that I could do this a couple
different<00:02:28.459> ways<00:02:29.230> first<00:02:30.230> what<00:02:30.350> I'm<00:02:30.440> going<00:02:30.560> to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
different ways first what I'm going to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.910 
different ways first what I'm going to
do<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.270> want<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.450> connect<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.410> yellow<00:02:33.680> black

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
do is I want to connect the yellow black

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.490 
do is I want to connect the yellow black
wire<00:02:34.160> onto<00:02:34.430> my<00:02:34.520> test<00:02:34.790> suite<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.709> see

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
wire onto my test suite and you can see

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500 
wire onto my test suite and you can see
what<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.620> does<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.550> when<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.209> radio<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
what it does so when your radio is

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.970 
what it does so when your radio is
turned<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.260> put<00:02:42.440> 12<00:02:42.770> volts

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
turned on it's going to put 12 volts

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220 
turned on it's going to put 12 volts
which<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:43.400> red<00:02:43.580> wire<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.000> my<00:02:44.090> my<00:02:45.020> power

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
which is this red wire for my my power

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.420 
which is this red wire for my my power
supply<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:45.709> going<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.890> put<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
supply I'm going to put that to the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
supply I'm going to put that to the
blue-white<00:02:47.530> trigger<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.100> bypass<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.440> you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
blue-white trigger on the bypass so you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.290 
blue-white trigger on the bypass so you
got<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:51.980> ground<00:02:52.250> pulse<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.730> went<00:02:52.880> away<00:02:52.970> and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
got one ground pulse it went away and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.060 
got one ground pulse it went away and
then<00:02:53.390> came<00:02:53.600> back<00:02:53.630> on<00:02:53.930> solid<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:54.860> that's

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
then came back on solid so that's

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.860 
then came back on solid so that's
basically<00:02:55.489> duplicating<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> function<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.720> an

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
basically duplicating the function of an

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.280 
basically duplicating the function of an
e-brake

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
e-brake

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.640 
e-brake
getting<00:02:58.130> engaged<00:02:58.519> released<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.780> put<00:03:00.290> back<00:03:00.440> on

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
getting engaged released and put back on

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.080 
getting engaged released and put back on
permanently<00:03:01.160> now<00:03:01.640> what's<00:03:01.850> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> happen

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
permanently now what's going to happen

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.759 
permanently now what's going to happen
while<00:03:02.959> that's<00:03:03.200> happening<00:03:03.380> simultaneously

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
while that's happening simultaneously

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.860 
while that's happening simultaneously
the<00:03:04.430> yellow<00:03:04.700> black<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.209> also<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.630> rest

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
the yellow black is also going to rest

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.720 
the yellow black is also going to rest
at<00:03:06.080> ground<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:06.709> going<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.890> get<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.340> 12

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
at ground and it's going to get a 12
