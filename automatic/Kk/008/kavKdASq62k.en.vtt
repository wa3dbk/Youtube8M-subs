00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.770
 one of the most usual people 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.930
 used in the startup world is the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.520
 expression and will have pizza is no more than 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.470
 opportunity that the entrepreneur 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.050
 needs to get the attention of the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.420
 investor in space that change entering the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 value r 100 at the next step when 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.800
 the first mistakes that are made in 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.790
 risk entrepreneurs a focus very 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.760
 in product idea innovation or 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.800
 service and can rarely explain to the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 investor in an understandable way 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.870
 What is the problem is that it is indeed souza 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.400
 alves solve the second disability 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.350
 most commonly contained by 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.050
 entrepreneurs is the absence of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.820
 concretization of the correct market 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.100
 usually the market opportunity is 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.200
 achieved a very general way and 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.900
 not giving the investor the possibility 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.570
 to understand what the evidence is that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.280
 support this market transition and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.540
 many times what is the potential of 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.940
 market growth 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.729
 it is recommended that the entrepreneur who 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.430
 evil slimmer of steps to take to 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.009
 able to capture the market shares that 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.689
 it is proposed to achieve in particular at the 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.880
 introduction of the product into the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.460
 the third is usually over time 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.979
 on the part of the entrepreneurs is crisis or 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.439
 the team demonstrating to the investor in 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.600
 brief high technical capacity that 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.390
 about the product or service 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.670
 however, the most important investor 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.149
 technical issue associated with the product or 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.119
 service or idea is demonstration that 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.789
 the team has the capabilities of the stal 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.820
 appropriate to the implementation of the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.759
 seeking to obtain funding for 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.470
 show world knowledge mark 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.530
 show knowledge from the point of view 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.410
 and the team itself as it is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.220
 that are related is essential for the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.410
 investor 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.020
 I believe in design one of the most 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.750
 common with kit by the entrepreneurs have 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.640
 to the failure to state reasons for the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 the financial statements that are 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.750
 presented in what I enjoyed peace time 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.280
 to investors for investors. 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.710
 financial aspect being no longer 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.170
 important is if a crucial role is to 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.530
 obvious because they are made early 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.050
 documentary almost an analysis 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.730
 critical analysis of profitability that 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.569
 potentially is that the business can 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.940
 to present 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.830
 usually entrepreneurs have the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.230
 ability to show the factors 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.700
 critical success of your business but 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.890
 rarely have the ability to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 identify in the presentation the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.270
 their own project. 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.239
 in hours is lower than investors 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.459
 know that they have erred on the ground 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.040
 businesses can use such as 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.370
 been presented is very necessary. 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.989
 have what we normally follow 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.580
 proteus contingency plans and 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.730
 I managed to show this in a very 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.440
 is something that investors 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.630
 treated very well by the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.180
 entrepreneurs last and put lucas 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.519
 would have to draw attention has to do with 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.950
 the final part of the presentation 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.530
 entrepreneurs do for the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.319
 investors when investors 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 the perspective that entrepreneurs 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.890
 in paudalho perspective of leaving the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.690
 business after three to five years 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.120
 entrepreneurs do not demonstrating 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.329
 ignorance of what the modus 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.390
 operandi of the typology of investors 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.030
 with whom they relate to voter pitt 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.440
 but regardless of any errors 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.209
 which were focused 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.260
 I did not want to leave to wish good luck 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.140
 to all of you and say not to give up 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.130
 because in fact however the elevator there is no 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:18.400
 problem in paris well and take the next one 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:18.400
 player there
