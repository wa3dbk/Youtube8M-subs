00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 today itself digital dot tv a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.940
 tool to record audio 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.940
 directly in our slr 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.550
 hello how about tips one was in movies 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 digital dot tv and this time as 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.439
 can see we are in a different set to 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.660
 normal and in fact we have a look a 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.629
 little bit different from the traditional 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 we are recording the program right now 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.440
 5 March 2 and we are recording the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.050
 audio directly on camera through 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.290
 a device that is called ricky micro 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.040
 at the top I have a boom with 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.860
 a road ntg 3 that like all of you 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.379
 know is that a microphone showdown 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 feeds with phantom power and in 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.739
 camera we have a device that is 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.280
 flame remake crowd assist is a small 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.549
 little box that you are seeing on the screen and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.759
 this box has a few preamps and 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.560
 has certain specific circuits that 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.560
 they make us connect our 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.960
 xlr microphones that audio gain 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.990
 be high enough to not 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.210
 put noise directly to our 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.659
 camera we are doing the tests 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.109
 we are recording the program 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.789
 with this to demonstrate the quality of 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.369
 audio obviously we have a very good 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.729
 microphone up here but we want to see 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 how true is it that this kind of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.909
 devices can be used and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 save us the use of a recorder 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 external audio then let's stop 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 speak for you to listen to the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 noise level we are obviously in the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 study but at the moment when I 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.310
 I stop talking the noise level has 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.869
 that diminish considerably and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.270
 you practically do not have to hear anything at 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.670
 the best two three little things of noise that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280
 there is that there is outside the studio then 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.950
 let's see the noise level it captures 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.950
 the microphone with the river assist 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.140
 ok and more or less listened to 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.940
 preamps of this device 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.090
 they make the recording extremely 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 silent that there is no problem 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.209
 with the audio and we removed the comment 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.599
 that we have been doing during the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.090
 last years with respect to that 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.510
 you could only record the audio in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.000
 double system in a dslr 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.819
 with this device what we are 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.579
 checking is that not only can you 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.349
 record in double in double system but 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.810
 You can also record directly on 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.299
 camera as long as it's with a 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.060
 device with these characteristics the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.159
 audio level is pretty good the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.459
 amplifiers work well as 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.750
 can see on screen we are showing 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.730
 now the camera with which we record 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.890
 this more or less as it is configured 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.040
 so you can see the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.549
 device has level indicators 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.829
 audio has has the meters has 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.109
 also the one output for hearing aids 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.569
 to be able to monitor our audio that 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.900
 it is something very well important has 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.049
 phantom power has three outputs for 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.840
 good three tickets to connect xlr 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.269
 then we can use up to 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.310
 three devices two in a channel and one 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.920
 in one 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.140
 in a single channel we can do as 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.790
 what am I doing at this moment that 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.520
 it's a single connected microphone 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.670
 directly to the device and generate the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.959
 stereo mixing allows us to work with 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.400
 or without phantom power that is to say with 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.170
 microphones powered by battery or 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.269
 microphones that require phantom power 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 like this one that we are using in this 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.819
 moment also allows us in the case 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.550
 of cameras that do not have a system of 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.160
 Audio control disable with a 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.829
 switch disable this gain that 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.370
 has and can record effectively 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.840
 the audio on camera this version 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:28.470
 comes in two models one is the is the river 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.970
 well this micro and another is the river assist 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.700
 which is what we have now 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.380
 difference between one and another is that one 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.970
 does not have meters in fact we're 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.090
 showing the image on the screen of the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.940
 It has no meters and this one does have 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.710
 gauges and gain control which is 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.630
 the difference that for example in some 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.670
 cameras where we do have meters of 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.530
 audio on screen to the best 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.540
 it is necessary to have direct meters in 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.310
 the device however in cameras 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.320
 like the 5 of martos that we are 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.590
 using that they do not have meters 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.830
 audio or has no hearing aid output is 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.800
 important to have the version of the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.860
 normal micro river has no outlet 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.270
 hearing aids and has no meters then 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.670
 basically what we are checking 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.650
 with this is that if there way through 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.940
 a device of these to be able to record 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.680
 quality audio directly on camera 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.200
 obviously we do not need a 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.000
 reference microphone because we're not going 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.020
 to synchronize the audio the audio is 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.090
 recording directly on the material and 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.480
 definitely for those who work with 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.400
 A DSLR is an excellent alternative 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.130
 you can buy it in just 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.840
 link.com or can be bought through 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.270
 the well-made distributors have it 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.580
 they have it what different companies have 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.280
 then it is a very viable alternative 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.690
 saves us a lot of time in post to not 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.040
 have to be synchronizing to not 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.810
 have to be recording a double 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.729
 system and at the end of the day as we have 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.349
 mentioned many times 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.020
 money then the time that we 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.939
 save on postproduction is only 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.159
 time that we can devote to either 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.009
 other projects or do some kind of 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.900
 personal work or dedicate it to our 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.479
 family to our friends to any 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.189
 another activity then all for today if 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.569
 have any doubt or ruiz or some
