00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.970
 1 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.110
 good 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 no 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.770
 we 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.430
 1 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.430
 no 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 Oh 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 Oh 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 1 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.810
 Oh 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.810
 1 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 we 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 we 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.820
 my 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 1 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.990
 here we stop a little brutally 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.770
 but we could play like that during 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.399
 an iron moment coupled after complete 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.630
 American gospel standard and we're in 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.450
 D minor with bass tuned to the ray 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.710
 the trick to good to get into 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.479
 the fingers this piece is to spot 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 the positions of agreement is to know that 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.100
 one anticipates each agreement of a crooked 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.759
 a tick before the new measure we have 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.759
 already the new position 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.730
 all 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.510
 forgiving motherboards 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.810
 no 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.770
 the receipt similar women 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.770
 no 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 the 7th on the and the measure before the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280
 back 7th 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.989
 it is very minor and such 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.989
 the minor this hen 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.730
 7 5 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
 1 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.800
 no 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.690
 we 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.340
 and so for sure blues must 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.600
 that there are little ben who are not 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:58.840
 necessarily marked third a little bit on 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.840
 do it 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:10.100
 passing a quarter of a ton finally a 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.680
 little attention like that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.650
 it's important for the expression in 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 this kind of song here is the picking 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.770
 right hand not very complicated but 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.690
 especially think about this anticipation of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.520
 the harmony a quaver before time it 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.720
 will actually help you a lot to put in 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.890
 place the hackers who have you week in 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.090
 the score when you work is 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.090
 a little hook to actually say 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.440
 the agreement and how did that once 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.640
 that we understand it is the positions 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.260
 come alone and that's a lot 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.840
 simpler so simplify your life 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.340
 Anticipated we find ourselves next 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.340
 times for a blues brawl hi all
