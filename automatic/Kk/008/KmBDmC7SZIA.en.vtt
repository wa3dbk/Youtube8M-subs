too<00:00:54.180> bad<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> game

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
too bad to actually get this in a game

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
too bad to actually get this in a game
i'm<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.770> super<00:00:56.370> hyped<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
i'm not really super hyped about it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
i'm not really super hyped about it
that's<00:00:57.420> why<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:58.320> hasn't<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.710> been<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that's why there hasn't really been a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
that's why there hasn't really been a
video<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.000> channel<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
video on my channel about this

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
video on my channel about this
discussing<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.530> before<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.149> me

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
discussing this before because to me

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
discussing this before because to me
it's<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.080> chakra<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.860> chakram<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's pretty much a chakra a chakram on a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's pretty much a chakra a chakram on a
string<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.270> even<00:01:06.630> close<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> flail<00:01:07.350> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
string it's even close to the flail as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
string it's even close to the flail as
well<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.010> honestly<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.119> should<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> fun

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
well so honestly it should just be a fun

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.330 
well so honestly it should just be a fun
weapon<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.950> being<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
weapon because I don't see this being a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
weapon because I don't see this being a
late-game<00:01:11.640> thing<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.960> too<00:01:13.110> much

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
late-game thing because this too much

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
late-game thing because this too much
similar<00:01:13.830> weapons<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
similar weapons going on there because I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
similar weapons going on there because I
dad<00:01:16.110> acts<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> shock<00:01:16.710> room<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
dad acts like a shock room because you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
dad acts like a shock room because you
throw<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.780> returns<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:20.009> much

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
throw it out it returns to you very much

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
throw it out it returns to you very much
like<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> flail<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.299> yeah<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> don't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
like a flail as well so yeah I don't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.390 
like a flail as well so yeah I don't
really<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.650> else<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.280> do

really know what else you want to do
with<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> course<00:01:24.390> he<00:01:24.509> could<00:01:24.659> add<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
with that but of course he could add in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
with that but of course he could add in
like<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.290> crazy<00:01:25.590> yo<00:01:25.890> yo<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> doom<00:01:26.909> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
like some crazy yo yo of doom or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
like some crazy yo yo of doom or
something<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:28.259> totally<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
something like that that's totally a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
something like that that's totally a
thing<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.890> could<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> thing<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
thing you could do but the thing is the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
thing you could do but the thing is the
weapon<00:01:31.170> spread<00:01:31.380> itself<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
weapon spread itself as you can see it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760

would<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.820> sort<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.810> spherical<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
would just be sort of spherical and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
would just be sort of spherical and
somewhat<00:01:35.640> dull<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.150> mean<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> yo-yo<00:01:37.049> like

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
somewhat dull I mean it is a yo-yo like

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
somewhat dull I mean it is a yo-yo like
how<00:01:37.560> much<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.220> without<00:01:38.970> making<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
how much could you do without making it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.190 
how much could you do without making it
a<00:01:39.720> ginormous<00:01:40.049> actual<00:01:41.329> monstrous<00:01:42.329> weapon<00:01:42.689> but

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a ginormous actual monstrous weapon but
