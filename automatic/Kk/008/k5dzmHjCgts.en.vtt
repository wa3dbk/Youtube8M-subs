00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.090
 saint seiya or mega will soon end their 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.509
 broadcasts on the television as well the 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.610
 series was proposed for 51 chapters the 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.860
 true that this anime has an excellent 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.170
 argument and good character design 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 a story that agrees in times 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.119
 ages and adventures however the fans 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
 They are determined to want to see the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 same battles of Seville and his friends 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 the same background music the same 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 dialogs et cetera etcetera really or 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.130
 mega respects the essence of saint 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 seiya and that is a very favorable point for 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 those of us who are fans of this series many 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.309
 of you who consider yourself fans of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.870
 saint seiya can observe that the series 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 or megan does not lose even the most subtle 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 science of history but people 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 keep talking that lost canvas should 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 be encouraged as it is a story 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 great and it is true yes it is but 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.440
 remember that this series created by 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.359
 hiroshi elites only came out for manga and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 dvd and it's not an official story 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.640
 accepted by the television channel atb and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.620
 distributed saint seiya the fans 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.230
 repudiate or mega since for them it is a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 story for children which are in a 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.280
 awful mistake the omega argument 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 has a very youthful history 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 with very current topics such as energy 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.479
 of light and darkness that are monopolizing 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 in the books series movies the light and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.440
 the darkness very good combination for 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 explain that it comes from the cosmos and that 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.580
 the universe manages only energies the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.490
 human or thought is what the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 make dark or white from there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 themes are not for children now the design 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.020
 of the armors and the elements the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.759
 fans must accept that it is another era 20 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.619
 years later they can not design the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.659
 same armor and the elements are 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 also the main topics in books 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.729
 and movies saint seiya or mega is a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 series that made me entertain following 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 that great essence of saint seiya or 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.539
 in guy to have alive that flame that always 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.610
 we had to follow this story the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.770
 true fans we are not because of the fact 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 to like the pegasus gentleman of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.300
 swan of andromeda but that we 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.039
 we fell in love with the story young 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.899
 teenagers born under one 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.000
 guardian constellation that by chance 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.039
 of fate you will get the armor of your 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.810
 constellation when the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.150
 most of the cosmos or power to be able 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.250
 be a saint of the goddess atenea and together 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.390
 defend the goddess and make clear to 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.280
 the villains that was 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.410
 the gods with ambitions and power of 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 control the earth has already passed and this new 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.080
 era is for humans to live it 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.760
 how they want to little is not fantastic 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.740
 that's why the real fans follow 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.260
 watching 'omega' because it follows that essence 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.270
 just that with new themes new 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.690
 production and art design focused more 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.220
 to this stage of the 2000's is some fans 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 of glad that or mega ends in the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.930
 chapter 51 but all those you have 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.690
 there watching and being aware of 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.150
 each chapter the series ends by 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.670
 Contract or mega reasons was intended 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.800
 for those chapters two seasons that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.170
 not any series arrives if the series does not 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 it works it stays in 20 chapters and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.870
 goodbye but mega followed in japan was 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.910
 accepted now if in 2013 it was not 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.100
 announced with another season is for the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.140
 simple reason that or mega will be disseminated and 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.420
 translated to many countries to make it 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.850
 transmitted therefore the series 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 will remain active waiting to be accepted 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.130
 in other countries as well as sales of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.680
 your toys if this turns out to be a success what 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.720
 more likely that by 2014 we have 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.940
 more from saint seiya or mega 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.070
 on the other hand in ex dimension has not been 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.830

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.420
 for 2014 could be encouraged iomega 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.520
