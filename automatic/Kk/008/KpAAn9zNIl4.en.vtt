impossible<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.590> stay<00:06:22.830> on<00:06:22.980> your<00:06:23.070> fat-burning

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
impossible to stay on your fat-burning

plan<00:06:23.880> now<00:06:24.870> I'm<00:06:24.930> not<00:06:25.020> here<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.350> tell<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.770> we<00:06:25.860> all

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
plan now I'm not here to tell you we all

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.380 
plan now I'm not here to tell you we all
don't<00:06:26.280> need<00:06:26.430> a<00:06:26.460> certain<00:06:26.730> amount<00:06:26.850> of<00:06:27.090> insulin

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
don't need a certain amount of insulin

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.390 
don't need a certain amount of insulin
in<00:06:27.570> our<00:06:27.660> bloodstream<00:06:27.870> because<00:06:28.800> if<00:06:28.950> we<00:06:29.100> didn't

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
in our bloodstream because if we didn't

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.430 
in our bloodstream because if we didn't
we'd<00:06:29.850> all<00:06:30.030> be<00:06:30.210> walking<00:06:30.540> around<00:06:30.630> as<00:06:30.870> diabetics

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
we'd all be walking around as diabetics

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.800 
we'd all be walking around as diabetics
but<00:06:32.100> what<00:06:32.220> I<00:06:32.250> am<00:06:32.460> saying<00:06:32.850> is<00:06:33.090> that<00:06:33.120> many<00:06:33.450> people

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
but what I am saying is that many people

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.320 
but what I am saying is that many people
are<00:06:33.960> releasing<00:06:34.470> way<00:06:34.770> too<00:06:34.830> much<00:06:35.460> insulin<00:06:36.000> and

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
are releasing way too much insulin and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.970 
are releasing way too much insulin and
that's<00:06:36.810> why<00:06:36.960> it's<00:06:37.110> nearly<00:06:37.320> impossible<00:06:37.530> for

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
that's why it's nearly impossible for

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.430 
that's why it's nearly impossible for
them<00:06:38.220> to<00:06:38.280> lose<00:06:38.580> any<00:06:38.790> weight<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.900> answer<00:06:40.290> that

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
them to lose any weight the answer that

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.870 
them to lose any weight the answer that
you<00:06:40.470> need<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.860> this<00:06:41.010> problem<00:06:41.250> is<00:06:41.520> knowing

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
you need to this problem is knowing

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.760 
you need to this problem is knowing
exactly<00:06:42.000> which<00:06:42.540> foods<00:06:42.840> you<00:06:42.960> can<00:06:43.080> eat<00:06:43.260> that

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
exactly which foods you can eat that

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.470 
exactly which foods you can eat that
will<00:06:43.950> not<00:06:44.130> cause<00:06:44.160> this<00:06:44.610> blood<00:06:44.880> sugar<00:06:45.180> insulin

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
will not cause this blood sugar insulin

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.990 
will not cause this blood sugar insulin

how to recognize those foods right now I
