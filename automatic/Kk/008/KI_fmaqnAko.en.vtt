00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.519
 so my name is Eric Attias 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 I am a professional dog breeder 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's my passion and I transform them into 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.320
 a job is how many years 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.970
 it's been 17 years and with what race have you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 you started I started with the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 Rottweiler 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 because I love this dog it's a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 dog who has a crazy elegance that is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.599
 very athletic and unlike 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.260
 received or preconceived ideas this auction 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.590
 extremely nice it's a breed 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 absolutely yes 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.579
 more than ever and others 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 added up close yes I raise the shepherd 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.410
 Australian for 12 years because it's 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.969
 an exceptional dog for the family 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.539
 a great kindness 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 very sociable he is a good guardian without 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.820
 aggressiveness 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.200
 I do not like aggressive dogs 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 I could not one but two dogs 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.460
 aggressive and then in the dog any 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.470
 the family in addition he has an aesthetic 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.040
 and beautiful dresses we find bland 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.260
 the same then I'm raising bulldog 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.930
 American so the origin of the bulldog 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.250
 american on the bulldog English 19th 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.920
 century you have English people who have 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.350
 emigrated to the united states with their dogs 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 and local cattle conveyors 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 crossed the English bulldog with a 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
 indigenous race to give them a 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.890
 little bit of size to remove the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.300
 heart problems that could have 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.990
 the bulldogs led their breathing 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.450
 difficult 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 so if you want conveyors to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.810
 holes to steer the flocks with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.550
 dogs such as shepherds 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.159
 Australian but the guard of the flocks 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.420
 was done by the bulldogs 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.520
 who are now the bulldogs 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 american today we talk a lot 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.619
 of words the solid right now because 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 the American methods then chases it 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.829
 There have American Bulldog Hey Bulldog 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.060
 american you have balls of 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.159
 breeders raising bulldog 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.109
 American without any genealogy nor 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.220
 no pedigree so it's the door 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.620
 opened 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.500
 to all and you have breeders who 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.020
 raise American bulldogs with 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 American bulldog associations where 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.570
 are registered parents so who 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.370
 publishes a pedigree me my puppies and my 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.710
 American jobs are registered at 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.020
 loba the low lot and the book of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.010
 origins of the American bulldog who 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.840
 develops a European pedigree likewise 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.760
 title as the pedigree of society 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.350
 central canine so you buy a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.880
 American bulldog you are sure that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.200
 it's an American bulldog because 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.940
 that there is an offspring up to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580
 rear great grandparents and at 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.950
 level of detention that the law says 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.420
 then there is no guideline 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.030
 no law are not dogs that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 are concerned with the legislation on 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.690
 dangerous dogs because at the same 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.190
 as Argentinian mastiffs are 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.430
 molossoids but who are not dogs 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.660
 aggressive and that does not require 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.680
 muzzle no detention permit 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.040
 absolutely nothing is like if you have 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.390
 a poodle or yorkie but in addition 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.340
 big and as for the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.709
 behavior no you would define it's 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.480
 very low and it's a very good dog 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.560
 because he has a little bit the same 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.420
 characteristics that the shepherd 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 Australian to know it's a dog 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.320
 which is of a natural kind it is 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.680
 good guardians with children that's 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.260
 very protective robust health test 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.330
 know it fits quite everything to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.010
 done and in addition it's a dog that can 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.320
 to be very athletic very athletic 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.239
 that is, if they fall on one in 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.010
 a family who play jeans 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.580
 jogging walking bike cycling hospital 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.600
 if we 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.730
 it's a dog that has the qualities 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.680
 physical also to continue his 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.280
 master or participate in events 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.950
 sports 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.800
 here 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.330
 ference among the rest I like you 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.620
 but I'm going to be very honest I 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.760
 love them four otherwise I can not 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.760
 breed a breed that I would like to pass 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.800
 my heart dog so I have a weak 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 for for my Australian Shepherd for 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.420
 this one in quarters at wimbledon and 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.940

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.799
 with as I raised horses 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.510
 Americans for 20 years and that the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.480
 Australian shepherd it's a dog that is 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.989
