00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
doing with my son couple of pages a day
nothing<00:01:26.490> too<00:01:26.640> aggressive<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.300> he<00:01:27.420> seems<00:01:27.660> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
nothing too aggressive and he seems to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.570

game<00:01:29.820> yet<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.630> thought<00:01:31.229> maybe<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.590> might<00:01:31.619> have

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
game yet I thought maybe it might have

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.230 
game yet I thought maybe it might have
been<00:01:31.890> too<00:01:32.070> early<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.640> him<00:01:32.729> since<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.030> only

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
been too early for him since he was only

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
been too early for him since he was only
three<00:01:33.570> last<00:01:33.780> year<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:35.100> thinking<00:01:35.399> about

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
three last year but we're thinking about

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.470 
three last year but we're thinking about
that<00:01:35.850> too<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.540 

you
