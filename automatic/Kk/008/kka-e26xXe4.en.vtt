00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.750
 very good everyone here I bring you 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.410
 fig pacman 3 to complete then a 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.150
 cave area it is about the area of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.519
 character customization only has 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.950
 two little things a golden brick and a 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.920
 hidden character so let's go to it 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.320
 we come to the batcueva let's choose a 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.140
 character to pay in my case always 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.210
 comman superman and will place near some 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 soon game of superman style pacman 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.199
 origin would be very good something current 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.360
 it would be fine I would buy it 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.899
 Here we go to customize characters 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.550
 of the cave and let's start looking 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.579
 those hidden objects fix that there 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.210
 five there is one how to break it you have 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.309
 fixed well here we have the second the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.530
 order does not matter to me this is the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.440
 third here is another one that I have skipped 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.519
 the fourth 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.949
 hidden here behind and there is not one left and 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.539
 right here is the last and hidden one 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.010
 camouflages with the color of the environment and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.799
 above the lighting is towards the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 another side if it has been complicated 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.640
 find the five states as a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.350
 ten minutes circling and that's why they have 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 seen cut here we have the ghost already 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.649
 gray care with him 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.490
 blake 2 so it was called the 32nd episode 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.840
 by batman the animated series was 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.030
 published issued for the first time on 4 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 November 1992 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 the episode has the star 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.740
 invited to dan uex better known for his 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.550
 Batman role in the 1960s 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.679
 batman television series as he plays the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.319
 gray ghost a character who has a 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.640
 great like batman background the 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:49.819
 shadow has left 500 thousand and good is a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.560
 Most character has his theme is so web 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.069
 hidden in that gray suit hat and a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.040
 layer and pistol adam uex of equal the 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.600
 gray ghost 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.120
 and that's what gives a little something 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.460
 golden brick that is just 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.980
 here what you have to do is go 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.220
 to change character forgiveness was not 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.090
 this what I wanted to do I'm going to change to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.530
 batman or better as the director kevin 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.310
 it was closer we broke the glass 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.140
 now if we take robin 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 because we have more at hand that knows 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.920
 manipulate the computers we put 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.580
 reed this is easy is not complicated 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.850
 for me if so, that has failed in 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.150
 the hack 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.530
 and golden brick and we have finished in the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.410
 next episode it will be 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.020
 multiple missions one behind the other 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 do not lose it and we are going to finish what 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.080
 is the pac cave although then it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.560
 gives a series of videos about the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.650
 virtual mini-games that in this area 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.480
 entails I hope I can help you in that 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 you know that this goes step by step if you have 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.070
 some doubt just looking at the list of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 reproductions it is not impossible that you 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.940
 you lose but just in case down 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.500
