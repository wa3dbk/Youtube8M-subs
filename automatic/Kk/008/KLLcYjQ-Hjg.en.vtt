 realize what really looked like 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 mission impossible 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 but they are not angel 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 they are men of the national brigade corps 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.830

 works of art have been brought out of the rubble 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.119
 why work in maximum safety 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 subsequently they were installed pissed off 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.729
 and it was possible 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599

 on the ground they were like this 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.400
 after working to avoid being seen 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.449

 that they always brought into the door introduced inside the dome 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 through the opening produced very sweet

 also in the exact basilica of San Bernardino, which was followed exactly 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.909
 in the mind of facebook 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.229
 just to avoid 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.439
 the bell tower was in fact devastated by madmen 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.430
 the cover fell off 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.180
 three of the four sides of the belfry 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.330

 initially the fire brigade showed the matches from there 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.569
 then they secured the only side of the maximum bell tower 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 which was reinforced with tiles 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.520
 Exactly shaped wooden scaffoldings have made it feel and then still have 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.150

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.650
 even the dome of San Bernardino underwent a work of encircling 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.969
 some points the structure was fortified.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.560
 moreover to avoid further wearily to the deeds to create some 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:53.400
