than I expected it to be given that it

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.280 
than I expected it to be given that it
is<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.770> movie<00:04:48.190> I've<00:04:48.280> never<00:04:48.340> heard<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.850> or<00:04:49.290> seen

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
is a movie I've never heard of or seen

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.790 
is a movie I've never heard of or seen
ever<00:04:50.740> except<00:04:51.670> on<00:04:51.820> Netflix<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:53.260> was<00:04:53.440> okay<00:04:53.770> I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
ever except on Netflix it was okay I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.380 
ever except on Netflix it was okay I
would<00:04:54.070> give<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.400> watch<00:04:54.580> if<00:04:54.880> you're<00:04:55.090> into

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
would give it a watch if you're into

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.450 
would give it a watch if you're into
those<00:04:55.540> kind<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.930> movies<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.500> was<00:04:56.620> realistic<00:04:57.130> in

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
those kind of movies it was realistic in

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.860 
those kind of movies it was realistic in
the<00:04:57.580> sense<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.150> could<00:04:58.240> actually<00:04:58.300> happen

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
the sense that it could actually happen

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.440 
the sense that it could actually happen
I<00:04:59.140> guess<00:04:59.380> but<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.520> police<00:05:00.820> work<00:05:01.060> were<00:05:01.240> just

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
I guess but the police work were just

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.090 
I guess but the police work were just
horrible<00:05:02.020> about<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.560> don't<00:05:02.710> think<00:05:02.860> would

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
horrible about I don't think would

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
horrible about I don't think would
happen<00:05:03.370> at<00:05:03.490> all<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:05.250> overall<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.460> it's<00:05:06.790> not

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
happen at all and overall the it's not

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.970 
happen at all and overall the it's not
100%<00:05:07.690> realistic<00:05:08.380> but<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.590> guess<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.950> could

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
100% realistic but I guess it could

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.820 
100% realistic but I guess it could
happen<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.940> guess<00:05:10.150> it's<00:05:10.390> kind<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.840> like<00:05:11.050> saw<00:05:11.470> in

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
happen I guess it's kind of like saw in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.300 
happen I guess it's kind of like saw in
a<00:05:11.980> way<00:05:12.130> that<00:05:13.000> they<00:05:13.180> make<00:05:13.360> them<00:05:13.570> choose<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:15.160> do

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
a way that they make them choose to do

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.760 
a way that they make them choose to do
something<00:05:15.850> or<00:05:16.120> die<00:05:16.420> right<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.810> mean<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.260> loved<00:05:17.620> I
