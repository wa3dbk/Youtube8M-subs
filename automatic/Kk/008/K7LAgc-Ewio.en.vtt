00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.559
 very good good I'm edited my way of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.539
 I already know that many of you know me 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.900
 but to all those who do not know me 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.170
 and to you also of course 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.120
 tell you that 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.950
 after seeing many questions 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.529
 many things that they spend 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.670
 and after having had 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.550
 life good life the years take away 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.220
 youth but they give you other things not for 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 example experiences 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.640
 I decide first and foremost not 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.740
 I am a recognized guitarist where more 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 he is known on youtube and thanks to 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.620
 you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 I am not a person who lives from the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 guitar although some of you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 It may seem that yes I do not have a title 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 I recognize I have not known nor 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.340
 I played with tomatito or paco de lucia 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 I'm sorry is to say that I am a humble 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.900
 amateur but what I have thought is 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.430
 I know how it feels when 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 learning that I know how you feel 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.619
 when he feels the impotence of moving forward and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 you do not really know if that's normal 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.890
 or is it normal then I want to explain 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.500
 my experiences is worth 100 videos that will be 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.380
 very short I'm going to title my 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.570
 experience for the guitar and there we go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.759
 to talk about everything about how to discover my 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.080
 first song and first chord my 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.480
 first professors how to lie 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 the guitar and I discovered it as from 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.010
 felt many times and surely that 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.130
 will match many of the things 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.800
 that you and you feel 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.170
 so to dispel doubts I think that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.500
 I already have a channel I already have the channel 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.280
 where he goes for the 400 videos or so 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.340
 It is not very long and I do not intend to leave it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.650
 neither and there is enough material like 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.560
 to work it but apart from everything 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.400
 that is the practice I also think it is 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 interesting this kind of videos that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.370
 I want to do and that you should not lose or 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.610
 it's not worth I really mean it with all 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 sincerity that 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.040
 that sometimes, thank you very much 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.400
 someone tell you that what is 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.710
 happening then what you are feeling 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.270
 is 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.040
 in normal and that you will overcome based on 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.070
 work importance patience and many 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.740
 other things we are not going to leave here is 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.819
 an explanatory video of what I want 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.660
 do 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.260
 and we 're going to leave it here and not thanks 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.260
