00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello to all I hope that all the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.899
 world wins at what jean phi 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 today I will make you a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.580
 little video on how to aim and shoot 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 with the spear gun I had a lot of 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.730
 posts that asked me how to do 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 so that's so it will be one of the topics 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.429
 condition of which it will rather be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 the theory and that's how I 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.250
 practice and that I finally manage 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 for a little while 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 a little while so so here is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.350
 first of all I wanted to tell you so 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 for approaching techniques do 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 get back on it so when you see a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 fish good bah you go down with 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 your wife palmer you world 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.539
 always discretion not a lot of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 bubbles and then it's not necessary that the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 fish once you have a little 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 the fish what to do 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 you have your rifle 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 especially being in perfect balance it's 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.370
 to say it does not take your body either 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 unbalanced either by the current or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 by the waves 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 otherwise you will be able to be a little bit 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 left a little to the right and your shot you 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.719
 go miss it what to do so 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 for both techniques we use 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.660
 mainly whether it's fishing 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.520
 Indian fishing 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.830
 casting should not be done when you 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.360
 are you fishing indian that you 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.780
 get on the fish you're finally 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.309
 your body is positioned 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.659
 horizontally in relation to the fish 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.310
 on the other hand when you make a casting 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.560
 will you go down it takes your body 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.970
 be really in alignment with 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.520
 your rifle whether they are in or 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 vertical guinea compared to position 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.890
 vertical compared to fish that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.450
 Its very important 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.740
 then it will not take at all to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.090
 imbalance is this as everywhere so 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.070
 you are a little left a little excited 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.110
 it was not going to do you have 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.460
 missed whatever happens the fish so 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.270
 to shoot with a famous rifle 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.159
 during what needs to be done 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.020
 so always pull with your arm 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.670
 tense right there I do not see it doing in 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.930
 condition because if you had the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.230
 broken arm you're not going to be able 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.810
 shoot 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.410
 it's useless so you really have to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.390
 to have waited a long time for the possible 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.130
 so that's very important at 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.380
 level of the aim which of the advised it 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.000
 is useless it's not common a rifle 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 hunting in quotation marks you must not 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.760
 close a man from the tour 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.770
 when I lead and both eyes open 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.330
 so that's for against to target this 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.580
 which is important is that at the end of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.490
 account we must not have fun on some 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.600
 rifle so there is a little notch 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 in the end we can say like 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.690
 on hunting rifles 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 a little notch here and then there a 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.410
 little notch here it's useless for them 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.790
 to align one must not close to nike line 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.140
 in mourning since aligned this is not 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.160
 handle me what I do is arm 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.960
 tense this is how to do 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.370
 normally outstretched arm and finally 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.900
 course to target the fish what he 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.790
 have to do is they do account 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.740
 look at the end of his arrow 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.940
 only the end of his arrow but 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.920
 in the end that's what I do 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.660
 is that I draw a line a little 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.130
 imaginary between as I know that my 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.260
 arrow the go right between 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.270
 the end of my arrow and the bottom of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.340
 fish which like that I think 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.590
 I extrapolate using big words 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.210
 but at least I know very well that the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.190
 arrow valley towards this fish 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.740
 for that it's very important when shooting 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.390
 also as a little trick you must not 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.500
 to have a little wrist shot just 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.870
 when you pull the trigger you have to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.360
 hold the butt of the rifle firmly 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.459
 simply arm as a country 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.000
 with one on the alignment by train 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.470
 change etc 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
 I have to give it a little bit 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.010
 on the trigger but not a small 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.500
 blow up a little shot towards the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.540
 down because there 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 a little blow like that worth us 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.870
 very expensive either go up or 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.340
 down and so like that you have 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.960
 missed your fish so that it takes 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.100
 really do not have this little clip a 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.510
 time I had for a little while 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 that is to say that I was shooting I had a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 little shot I spoke a little bit a little 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.040
 by the waters and the arrow she go 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.540
 always up so that's very 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.500
 important 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.969
 three little things another year 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.469
 finished this video so security in 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.579
 a first time when you are in 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.780
 fishing course of course when you 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.030
 see for example a cross that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.829
 pass and who is a sinner ya by 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.569
 example a bather the fish and you 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.980
 do not shoot at it for nothing because 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.060
 you will be able to cross the fish 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.829
 but your I'll go a little bit more 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.819
 far from it's going to forget the best and 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.069
 second type second who becomes who 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.329
 also advise to animate your arrow that 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.739
 I already spoke to you when you see 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.000
 a big fish and that behind there is a 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.590
 rock is nothing to make the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.209
 in the end you have to calculate between 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.859
 quotation marks a better shooting angle 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.060
 because if you shoot it and the arrow goes 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.530
 cross the fish and the arrow 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.819
 to go crashing his rock you'll 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.500
 win everything you will surely have all the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.090
 fish with a little luck but by 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.519
 against your arrow will be lit 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.120
 last little tip I wanted 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.379
 often tell you after a while 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.269
 anggun when we fished for a small 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.290
 moment we realize that we do not 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.650
 cowardly one has the impression that is not 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.450
 right 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.760
 so she is a bit for you 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.799
 announces the only way to see if we 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.359
 is really so a smile if you 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.639
 finally put pons on one on one 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.780
 flat surface to announce a stable 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.190
 which I do not know if it is very flat 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.599
 Finally, here you are 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.909
 something that is very very flat is 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.320
 what are you doing so of course the 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.760
 city where you leave it like that because 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.260
 that if it's not going to do it because there 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.030
 will have a little boss yet does not care 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.159
 it's not important and you do it in 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.690
 ultimately ride on this surface 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.490
 flat and if you see it in you 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.380
 so putting the ball like that I do 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.639
 we are a little manic and in the end 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.349
 counting by rolling her like this 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.139
 otherwise if you see that in the end 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.340
 she does not totally adhere to the at the 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.720
 table that means there will be a 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.710
 hump somewhere and there at the end of 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.840
 account you are going to realize that 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.460
 your arrow had a little veiled or a 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.539
 little bit twisted in what to do 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.810
 in the end I 'm going to show you this 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.250
 that it is 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.230
 franck antenna a little bit you go 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.760
 like that I had it a little on hand on 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.380
 my thigh and then eat there I kill her 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.230
 wait a little bit and then good as 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.850
 I gently get it back so that 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.660
 it's a little trick to have for 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.639
 see if your arrow 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.230
 she is not you go where the epa 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.669
 authorize because in the end when 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.700
 you 're going to pull the blockages that are voting 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.650
 the purchase of slightly crooked either by the 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.150
 left either towards the verna the right 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.200
 when you're going to shoot in the end 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.090
 so much your buying meters doors 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.220
 and you're not going to have this famous 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.020
 straight line which I told you about a 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.790
 little imaginary towards the fish 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.110
 and so you missed a little of 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.550
 fish that will not fail every time 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.900
 but hey I'm slipping 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.950
 important that's how it is 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.669
 do that and that's how I do 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.790
 for a little while 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.680
 So here you go I listened to him 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.750
 I hope this little post will have you 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.700
 much more do not hesitate to ask me 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.960
 questions if you have not understood 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.389
 something was not moving was very 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.340
 clear what is it that jean phi I tell you 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.060
 see you soon and especially good fishing 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.060
 all and prudence
