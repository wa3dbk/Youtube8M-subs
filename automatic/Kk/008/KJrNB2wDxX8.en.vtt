rift<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.029> ever<00:00:21.210> since<00:00:21.420> then<00:00:21.660> people<00:00:22.140> have

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
share a few similarities between them
they<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:28.050> aimed<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.500> completely<00:00:29.130> different

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they are aimed at completely different

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
they are aimed at completely different
audiences<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.570> without<00:00:31.050> any<00:00:31.170> further<00:00:31.260> ado

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
audiences so without any further ado

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.650 
audiences so without any further ado
here<00:00:31.859> seem<00:00:32.070> microsoft<00:00:32.579> hololens<00:00:32.820> versus<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
here seem microsoft hololens versus the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
here seem microsoft hololens versus the

oculus rift differences explained video

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
oculus rift differences explained video
so<00:00:36.300> i'd<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> start<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:36.840> by<00:00:36.899> saying<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so i'd like to start off by saying that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.959 
so i'd like to start off by saying that
both<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:37.860> devices<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
both of these devices are on the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
both of these devices are on the
completely<00:00:39.420> opposite<00:00:39.960> side<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> spectrum

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
completely opposite side of the spectrum

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
completely opposite side of the spectrum
and<00:00:41.010> they<00:00:41.520> are<00:00:41.640> aimed<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.000> completely

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and they are aimed at completely

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.240 
and they are aimed at completely
different<00:00:42.780> audiences<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.800> said<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
different audiences like I said in the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
different audiences like I said in the
beginning<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> video<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.570> reason

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
beginning of the video and the reason

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
beginning of the video and the reason
why<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> am<00:00:46.410> making<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.800> comparison<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
why I am making this comparison is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.029 
why I am making this comparison is
because<00:00:48.360> people<00:00:48.660> seem<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.110> misinformed<00:00:49.500> or

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because people seem to be misinformed or

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459 
because people seem to be misinformed or
misled<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.449> each<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> his

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
misled about what each one can do in his

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.330 
misled about what each one can do in his
own<00:00:52.680> uniqueness

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
own uniqueness

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
own uniqueness
so<00:00:53.699> essentially<00:00:54.000> both<00:00:54.300> Microsoft<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> oculus

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so essentially both Microsoft and oculus

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
so essentially both Microsoft and oculus
are<00:00:55.649> trying<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> create<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> virtual<00:00:57.090> reality

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
are trying to create a virtual reality

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
are trying to create a virtual reality
experience<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.440> takes<00:00:58.680> people<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.399> 3d

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
experience that takes people into a 3d

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
experience that takes people into a 3d
world<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.840> both<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.289> different

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
world but they both have very different

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
world but they both have very different
approaches<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
approaches for this so first of all the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
approaches for this so first of all the
oculus<00:01:04.320> rift<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> designed<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.220> people<00:01:05.400> who

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
oculus rift is designed for people who

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
oculus rift is designed for people who
want<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.330> immersive<00:01:06.689> experience<00:01:06.960> where

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
want a more immersive experience where

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
want a more immersive experience where
everything<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:08.340> them<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
everything around them is just kind of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
everything around them is just kind of
blocked<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.890> really

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
blocked from them and that's a really

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.500 
blocked from them and that's a really
really<00:01:11.430> interesting<00:01:11.520> experience<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
really interesting experience and it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.260 
really interesting experience and it's
aimed<00:01:12.810> toward<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> specific<00:01:14.310> group<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> people

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
aimed toward a specific group of people

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
aimed toward a specific group of people
not<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> general<00:01:16.530> audience<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.340> aimed

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
not a general audience so it's aimed

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
not a general audience so it's aimed
more<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.240> people<00:01:18.540> who<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> gaming<00:01:19.560> sort

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
more for people who want a gaming sort

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
more for people who want a gaming sort
of<00:01:20.159> environment<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:20.970> their<00:01:21.299> virtual<00:01:21.689> reality

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
of environment in their virtual reality

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
of environment in their virtual reality
experience<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> oculus<00:01:23.369> rift<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.729> also

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
experience and the oculus rift can also

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
experience and the oculus rift can also
track<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.270> head<00:01:24.570> using<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:25.049> external<00:01:25.320> camera

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
track your head using an external camera

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
track your head using an external camera
and<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.340> also<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> controller<00:01:27.299> but

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and you can also use the controller but

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
and you can also use the controller but
really<00:01:28.049> aside<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.220> pretty

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really aside from that it's a pretty

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
really aside from that it's a pretty
limited<00:01:29.640> experience<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.869> do

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
limited experience with what you can do

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
limited experience with what you can do
with<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.290> body<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.070> hand<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
with your body and on the other hand the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
with your body and on the other hand the
microsoft<00:01:33.060> hololens<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.110> practical

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
microsoft hololens is a more practical

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
microsoft hololens is a more practical
device<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> reason<00:01:35.549> why<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> say<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
device and the reason why I say this is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.090 
device and the reason why I say this is
because<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.500> whole<00:01:37.680> body<00:01:37.710> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because you can use your whole body as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
because you can use your whole body as
an<00:01:38.250> interface<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.659> limited

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
an interface and you're not just limited

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
an interface and you're not just limited
to<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.229> eyes<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> controller<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.579> your

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to your eyes or a controller in your

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.639 
to your eyes or a controller in your
hands<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.329> also<00:01:42.509> displays<00:01:42.840> holographic

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
hands it also displays holographic

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
hands it also displays holographic
images<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.130> front<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.549> eyes<00:01:44.670> which<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

something that the oculus rift can't

really do at the moment and that's
something<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:48.990> sets<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> whole

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
rift completely cross-platform which

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.910 
rift completely cross-platform which
brings<00:02:24.569> us<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.019> microsoft<00:02:25.620> hololens

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
brings us to the microsoft hololens

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
brings us to the microsoft hololens
which<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.819> probably<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.569> be<00:02:27.690> running<00:02:27.959> an

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
which is probably going to be running an

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680 
which is probably going to be running an
optimized<00:02:29.010> version<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.459> Windows<00:02:29.790> 10<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.569> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
optimized version of Windows 10 so that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
optimized version of Windows 10 so that
I<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.959> run<00:02:31.170> holographic<00:02:31.920> images<00:02:32.370> through<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I can run holographic images through the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.540 
I can run holographic images through the
use<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.180> hpu<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.319> holographic<00:02:35.010> processing

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
use of hpu or holographic processing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.160 
use of hpu or holographic processing
units<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.090> terms<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.420> flexibility<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
units so in terms of flexibility the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.140 
units so in terms of flexibility the
oculus<00:02:37.680> rift<00:02:37.799> takes<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.310> slight<00:02:38.640> edge<00:02:38.819> here

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
oculus rift takes a slight edge here

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
oculus rift takes a slight edge here
just<00:02:39.420> because<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.170> with<00:02:40.380> any

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
just because you can use it with any

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.559 
just because you can use it with any
platform<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.430> want<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.299> really

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
platform that you want but if you really

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.270 
platform that you want but if you really
don't<00:02:42.810> care<00:02:42.959> about<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.650> microsoft

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
don't care about that the microsoft

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.789 
don't care about that the microsoft
hololens<00:02:44.489> is<00:02:44.849> also<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.480> pretty<00:02:45.989> good<00:02:46.140> choice<00:02:46.349> so

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
hololens is also a pretty good choice so

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.320 
hololens is also a pretty good choice so
it's<00:02:46.890> obvious<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.580> are<00:02:47.760> targeted<00:02:48.180> at

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
it's obvious that these are targeted at

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.789 
it's obvious that these are targeted at
different<00:02:48.660> audiences<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.680> that's

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
different audiences and I think that's

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.710 
different audiences and I think that's
actually<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.220> good<00:02:50.459> thing<00:02:50.519> because<00:02:50.880> people<00:02:51.120> can

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
actually a good thing because people can

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.059 
actually a good thing because people can
choose<00:02:51.930> between<00:02:52.079> an<00:02:52.560> augmented<00:02:53.040> reality

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
choose between an augmented reality

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.250 
choose between an augmented reality
experience<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> microsoft<00:02:54.989> hololens

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
experience with the microsoft hololens

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.009 
experience with the microsoft hololens
or<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.980> completely<00:02:56.880> surrounding<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.660> virtual

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
or a completely surrounding and virtual

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.990 
or a completely surrounding and virtual
experience<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> oculus<00:02:59.489> rift<00:02:59.640> so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
experience with the oculus rift so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.100 
experience with the oculus rift so
hopefully<00:03:00.329> now<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> better

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
hopefully now you have a better

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.020 
hopefully now you have a better
understanding<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.220> each<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.760> geared

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
understanding of what each one is geared

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.490 
understanding of what each one is geared
towards<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.660> which<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.049> would<00:03:04.140> fit<00:03:04.319> your
