00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.570
 very interesting the behavior of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.630
 cats who will talk about this 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.910
 subject is titiana santana our doctor 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.500
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.860
 catarina and ok 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.290
 hello friends of cobasi tell our 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.870
 friends as history began between 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 humans and cats caring and it all started 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.870
 with the development of agriculture 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.210
 humans started to store grains and these 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.600
 grains attracted rats that in turn 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.719
 attracted cats exactly these cats 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.449
 are living with humans in exchange for 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.219
 favors they housed these animals in 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.739
 exchange of favor and thus building a 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.320
 partnership relationship exactly this 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.570
 partnership relationship is important because 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.810
 differentiates us by example from the dog 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.909
 the dog a leader is not a leader there 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.760
 the cat is not a relation of 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.310
 partnership with the human being and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.540
 who assists us with the benefits of 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.720
 have a cat 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.350
 karim the cat it is considered near the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.050
 future, because because he has a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.040
 differentiated behavior 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.530
 he can live with the absence of the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.830
 owner he can live in environments 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.230
 Little nÃ© and the cares are more 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.150
 simple project so it is a 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.820
 trend is not even the trend is 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.300
 have in some countries exactly the same 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.250
 feline population is larger than the dog population 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.180
 here in brazil this is going to be the trend 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.570
 already the population of cats grows very 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.270
 more than the right dog population and the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.460
 his primitive behavior continues to be 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.940
 even the door of the apartment and still has 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.679
 this behavior without ooo feline him 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.250
 did not change his behavior very much 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.670
 he still has some is some 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.860
 characteristics of the wild feline 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.170
 as much as we try to domesticate the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 cat is not tamed as well as 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.990
 dog 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.890
 it has a differentiated behavior 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.350
 in this 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.380
 is what is abnormal for the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.510
 owner is normal for a cat and 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.920
 what behaviors can we 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.290
 example, swinging from the tail to 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 the tail swinging dog is joy 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.830
 satisfaction to the cat he is troubled 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:51.040
 something is not right or ready for 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:54.819
 to attack is to roll the neon roll to the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.640
 dog indicates obedience to the cat is the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.160
 then the behavior is 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.320
 completely different dog and cat each 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.690
 one with its primitive behavior in the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.780
 the mind and it is important that the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.580
 owner understands that it is toys 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.390
 that we have, that what is available is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.340
 is to stimulate this act of hunting are 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.840
 toys that move 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.959
 toys that take care of this is this 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.079
 behavioral behaviors. 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.010
 we talk and the body is fully adapted 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.760
 the hunt 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.430
 yes the vision hearing the ears 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.440
 always attentive ear movement 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.600
 the right noises to the right mouth teeth 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.760
 Dogs are carnivores right teeth 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.280
 prominent large ne 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.280
 the big canines then all this does 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.200
 with which it the flexibility of the body 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.670
 all this causes the animal to be 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.100
 adapted to hunting 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.459
 So he'll want to cassette it. 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.290
 want to play already extinct netafim tu o 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.140
 cat is the only animal we do not 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.650
 we were able to fully tame him 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.540
 still it's behaviors of your 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.519
 ancestors 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.790
