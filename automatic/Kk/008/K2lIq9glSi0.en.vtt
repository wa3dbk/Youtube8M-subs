00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.010 
together pretty easy I'll kind of
explain<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.830> assembly<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:21.020> yeah

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
explain the assembly as well but yeah

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230 
explain the assembly as well but yeah
there<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> am<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> raise<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
there it is I am gonna have to raise it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
there it is I am gonna have to raise it
about<00:01:24.720> two<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.680> half<00:01:25.710> inches<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.400> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
about two and a half inches I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.219 
about two and a half inches I think
obviously<00:01:27.840> I'll<00:01:28.020> wait<00:01:28.290> until<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> tank

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
obviously I'll wait until I get the tank

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
obviously I'll wait until I get the tank
running<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> water<00:01:32.659> basically

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
running and in the water basically

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
running and in the water basically
cycling<00:01:34.140> through<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.979> sump<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
cycling through the the sump to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
cycling through the the sump to
determine<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.390> end<00:01:37.049> result<00:01:37.290> water

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
determine what my end result water

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920 
determine what my end result water
levels<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
levels gonna be but I I think the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.319 
levels gonna be but I I think the
operating<00:01:40.619> water<00:01:41.040> level<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.610> here's<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> gonna

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
operating water level and here's a gonna

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.889 
operating water level and here's a gonna
be<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.659> 10<00:01:42.990> inches<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.899> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
be about 10 inches and this will this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.830 
be about 10 inches and this will this
particular<00:01:49.680> skimmer<00:01:50.460> runs<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.210> best<00:01:51.509> at

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
particular skimmer runs the best at

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.380 
particular skimmer runs the best at
about<00:01:52.170> eight<00:01:52.680> seven<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.790> half<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> eight

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
about eight seven and a half to eight

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.800 
about eight seven and a half to eight
inches<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:56.159> water<00:01:56.490> heights<00:01:56.820> off<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.420> raise<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
inches of water heights off to raise it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.020 
inches of water heights off to raise it
up<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> couple<00:01:59.009> inches<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.110> but

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
up you know a couple inches or so but

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.130 
up you know a couple inches or so but
yeah<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.750> concerned<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.930> kind

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
yeah I was a little concerned it's kind

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
yeah I was a little concerned it's kind
of<00:02:07.200> kicking<00:02:07.409> myself<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> looked<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
of kicking myself when I looked at this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.160 
of kicking myself when I looked at this
but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
but

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.670 
but
the<00:02:11.360> distance<00:02:12.360> between<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.990> top<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the distance between the top of the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
the distance between the top of the
skimmer<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.920> basically<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.880> top<00:02:18.150> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
skimmer and the basically the the top of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.510 
skimmer and the basically the the top of
the<00:02:18.510> opening<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.530> being<00:02:20.070> able<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> get

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the opening here and being able to get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.610 
the opening here and being able to get
that<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.450> here

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.850 

basically<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.890> did<00:02:26.100> go<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> little

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
basically it did go in it was a little

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.170 
basically it did go in it was a little
tight<00:02:29.130> right<00:02:29.160> around<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.940> base<00:02:31.100> but<00:02:32.100> made<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
tight right around the base but made it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.970 
tight right around the base but made it
in<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.640> that's<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.820> whole<00:02:36.060> other<00:02:36.120> story

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
in so that's a whole other story

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.140 
in so that's a whole other story
basically<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.490> platform<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.790> board

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
basically this platform here this board

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.699 
basically this platform here this board
that<00:02:42.330> runs<00:02:42.450> across<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.020> bottom<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.500> mean<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
that runs across the bottom I mean I

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.699 
that runs across the bottom I mean I
have<00:02:44.240> videos<00:02:45.240> where<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.510> show<00:02:45.900> how<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.320> built

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
have videos where I show how I built

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.949 
have videos where I show how I built
this<00:02:46.890> stand<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.880> 2x4<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> it's

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this stand but the 2x4 is that it's

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.790 
this stand but the 2x4 is that it's
resting<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.830> basically<00:02:53.370> connect<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
resting on that basically connect this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.090 
resting on that basically connect this
front<00:02:55.800> piece<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.970> stand<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> back

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
front piece of the stand to the back

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.640 
front piece of the stand to the back
piece<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.310> stand<00:02:59.959> they're<00:03:00.959> standing

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
piece of the stand they're standing

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.650 
piece of the stand they're standing
upright<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.670> they're<00:03:02.820> standing<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.420> this

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
upright so they're standing up like this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.150 
upright so they're standing up like this
so<00:03:03.870> there's<00:03:04.080> two<00:03:04.260> by<00:03:04.380> four<00:03:04.620> here<00:03:04.770> there's<00:03:05.040> one

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
so there's two by four here there's one

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.610 
so there's two by four here there's one
at<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> end<00:03:05.580> there's<00:03:06.330> one<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:07.080> there's<00:03:07.260> one

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
at the end there's one here there's one

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.510 
at the end there's one here there's one
at<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.860> other<00:03:08.070> end<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.989> plywood<00:03:10.590> base<00:03:11.160> is

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
at the other end and the plywood base is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.460 
at the other end and the plywood base is
screwed<00:03:11.820> into<00:03:12.000> those<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.540> didn't<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.290> need

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
screwed into those I didn't really need

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.930 
screwed into those I didn't really need
to<00:03:13.560> stand<00:03:13.800> him<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.370> could<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.670> laid<00:03:14.790> him

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to stand him up I could have laid him

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.810 
to stand him up I could have laid him
down<00:03:15.120> flat<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.400> then<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.580> would<00:03:17.730> have

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
down flat and then that would have

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.430 
down flat and then that would have
dropped<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.450> board<00:03:18.810> down<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:20.459> inches<00:03:20.880> and

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
dropped this board down to inches and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.840 
dropped this board down to inches and
then<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.590> would<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.920> down<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.370> inches<00:03:23.730> they

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
then this would be down to inches they

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.580 
then this would be down to inches they
give<00:03:24.000> me<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> much<00:03:24.390> larger<00:03:24.840> gap<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.290> wouldn't

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
give me a much larger gap I wouldn't

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.509 
give me a much larger gap I wouldn't
have<00:03:25.739> any<00:03:25.920> problem<00:03:26.010> getting<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:28.680> that
