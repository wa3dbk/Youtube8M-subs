two-year process

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:02.930 
two-year process
you<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.040> while<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.370> were<00:03:02.489> touring<00:03:02.790> night

you know while we were touring night

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.460 
you know while we were touring night
visions<00:03:03.329> we<00:03:03.450> were<00:03:03.569> really<00:03:03.720> riding<00:03:03.989> smoke<00:03:04.319> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
visions we were really riding smoke and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.670 
visions we were really riding smoke and
mirrors<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:05.370> really<00:03:06.090> feel<00:03:06.329> like<00:03:06.360> as<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.170> band<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
mirrors I really feel like as a band you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.650 
mirrors I really feel like as a band you
know<00:03:07.829> we've<00:03:08.519> been<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> band<00:03:08.910> for<00:03:08.970> six<00:03:09.269> years<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
know we've been a band for six years and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.270 
know we've been a band for six years and
that<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.019> record<00:03:10.200> our<00:03:10.709> first<00:03:10.829> record<00:03:11.069> was

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that that record our first record was

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.470 
that that record our first record was
written<00:03:11.400> four<00:03:11.700> years<00:03:11.880> ago<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.209> had<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.329> lot

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
written four years ago so we had a lot

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.509 
written four years ago so we had a lot
of<00:03:12.510> growth<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.019> do<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:14.010> we<00:03:14.160> try<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> push

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
of growth to do and as we try to push

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.009 
of growth to do and as we try to push
out<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.910> our<00:03:15.060> boundaries<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.750> bit<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
out on our boundaries a little bit and

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.990 
out on our boundaries a little bit and
kind<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.230> explore<00:03:16.530> new<00:03:16.680> places<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.340> hopefully

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
kind of explore new places and hopefully
