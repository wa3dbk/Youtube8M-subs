00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.360
 hello welcome to my game we are going to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 begin the analysis of kingsford a 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.990
 passing game a little entertainment 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 unnoticed in the catalog that is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.759
 editorial because it's not the classic game 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 in fact it happens the same thing that happened with 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.900
 for example, drag that we have already 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.519
 analyzed is a game that in fact is not 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.519
 of faults and flight is from a publisher 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.680
 called free is from Andrea 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.690
 chÃ¡vez me and never and in arc imagine that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 the Italian game and it's also a game 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.909
 very euro style game is not the classic 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.769
 Mary costume full of miniatures typical of 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.659
 fantasy flight and usually in fact 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.820
 they pretend but it's a game almost 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.129
 we would say of dice that of board without 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.260
 However, it is a great game that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.390
 surprise when we see it because it's the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.710
 typical game that everyone likes or 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 at least everyone who has 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.680
 taught 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.199
 he liked some accuse him 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.800
 too much going down because in the end it's a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.720
 dice game but 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.360
 seen in a certain way does not stop being a 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.090
 resource management game this game 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.550
 It comes in a square box of 30 x 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.580
 30 on whose cover we have a palace 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.430
 a kind of medieval village appears its 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.290
 title kings by a river bridge we 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.530
 interested that the contest be made 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 authors and in its back we have the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.710
 game cable that are those things that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.990
 they call us attention is a board 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.080
 as with squares as you can see there are several 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.050
 dice and many chip cards do not 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.930
 forgiveness typical wooden pieces 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.210
 cubes so we give chips and up 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.610
 has the typical style point account 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.890
 euro vehicles talks a bit about the game 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.410
 tells us that it is a game of about 90 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.930
 minutes I think a little less 10 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.490
 years or more 8 more than enough this does not 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.960
 it's more than throwing dice yes that's true 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.060
 that some strategy can be proposed 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.220
 and you can even play annoying a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.530
 little to others too much but 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.590
 good is very simple to understand and 2 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.480
 to 5 players and here again comes 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 happening more or less the same as with 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.770
 any all this style better 5 than 2 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.970
 certainly better 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.000
 more players than fewer players 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.920
 Well what is the word about, let's say that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.360
 the king of the city puts us in charge 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.370
 each of the players in a series 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.070
 of citadels to administer them 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 We already over five eras five 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.980
 years with its seasons spring summer 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.140
 autumn winter each of the years 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 we have to try to have the best 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.030
 citadel of all to prove to the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.150
 king that we are perhaps the best 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.200
 leaders for their positions of trust 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.940
 we will achieve this today 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.810
 influence through our influence or 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.850
 through our let's say our 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.890
 conviction of certain 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.750
 assistants of the king who will even come to 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 be the king himself or the queen are both 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.860
 the two highest level assistants 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.080
 each of these assistants has a 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.450
 level on which we can influence for 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.700
 try to get their benefits 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.530
 at least during a season and this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.150
 way to evolve our 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.980
 citadel building different 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.760
 buildings and getting what in order to 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.459
 accounts it is important victory points 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.370
 it's a competitive game but although it's 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.140
 competitive we do not step on each other 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.970
 so we can as we said we can play 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.680
 it would be a bit harsh because we will see 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.569
 the resources are as always limited 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 and if you have them you can not have them 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.010
 another and perhaps at a certain moment 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.690
 I can go through situations where I do not 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.610
 interest so much but fuster and others 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.470
 although as the game time the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.909
 departure is limited 5 years, maybe not 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.319
 can waste so much time in annoying 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.390
 others like to come to what really 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.459
 I'm interested because there's a lot that 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.680
 manage in kirsch war so many resources 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.989
 materials stone gold wood like 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.079
 troop troops to face the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.629
 enemies that will attack us year after year 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.569
 as the construction itself and the points 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.459
 of victory of our cities a 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.680
 pretty interesting game and that from 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.049
 then he sins not to attract attention but 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 when you sit down if you try it you will see that 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.600
 is more than interesting and if not give 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.910
 this fortnight to see how is the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.500
 son let's go through the box or I'll go 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.090
 to open that is empty because here already 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.290
 has good health in the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.450
 vibrations 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.880
 it has the same that had nothing extra a 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.010
 great one of these plastic that 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
 should bring all the games to 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.420
 all the content that fits 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.740
 perfectly well once 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.410
 Of course there is little to thaw 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.810
 inside this one inside this box then 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.790
 let's see then I had this box 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.420
 to the content to fill this cradle already 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.970
 we discussed some things 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.430
 a manual of rules of these in format 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.870
 fact classic old 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.480
 they occupied the whole box but that also 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.730
 it's without cover very badly very badly formal 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.050
 please with cover and it comes 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.050
 four leaves nothing else comes pretty 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.610
 well explained the truth that this game 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.870
 has some simple rules is not 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.150
 difficult to understand but the manual 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.610
 it fulfills its function very well 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.490
 a four square wings board that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.440
 comes representing the kingdom for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.020
 stations and real advisors 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.400
 hiding the king the queen also has 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.880
 several sections for different 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.160
 markers 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.600
 five sheets one for each player are 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.920
 all the same have no distinction of 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.040
 color or anything on the other logo are 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.690
 black and here we have represented the 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.139
 buildings that can be built 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.270
 in each of our cities 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.629
 resources represented in cubes of 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.879
 way 25 golden 20 way 15 of 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.689
 stone that you see different number according to 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.089
 the resource that is 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.759
 sells chips that represent a die 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:50.040
 the side of 2 because we were not more 2 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.440
 plus 2 for our runs 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.230
 and some common resources plus 6 dice 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.020
 white two purple discs to indicate 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.200
 the round marker and the scoreboard 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.760
 station and a chip as a pawn cited 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.909
 also purple that represents the 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.069
 real counselor 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.780
 25 cards divided into 5 decks of five 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.060
 each one that will represent the 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.659
 five enemies was one whose 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.520
 difficulty from two to 45 degrees 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.280
 difficulty goes from three to five five of 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.770
 it was three difficulty from 4 to 6 5 of era 4 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.610
 difficulty from 5 to 7 and 5 from era 5 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.590

 and material for the five players in 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.250
 five colors each player has three 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.949
 sides of its color three chips

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.280
 green yellow and blue 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.930
 as you have seen the main thing the most 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.850
 important or the greatest role of 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.130
 kingsbury will have the data of 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.600
