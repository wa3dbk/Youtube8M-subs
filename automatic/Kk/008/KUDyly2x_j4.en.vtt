00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
which I highly recommend that you add to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.610 
which I highly recommend that you add to
your<00:00:31.410> Minecraft<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.369> add<00:00:32.610> anything<00:00:33.620> at

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
your Minecraft if you do add anything at

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190 
your Minecraft if you do add anything at
all<00:00:34.680> now<00:00:35.640> first<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> say

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
all now first of all I would like to say

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.270 
all now first of all I would like to say
that<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.670> gears<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.540> pulleys<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
that there are gears and pulleys and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
that there are gears and pulleys and
axles<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> water<00:00:42.090> wheels<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> basically

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
axles and water wheels and basically

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.910 
axles and water wheels and basically
what<00:00:43.110> happens<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> water<00:00:44.070> wheels<00:00:44.879> power

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
what happens is the water wheels power

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.319 
what happens is the water wheels power
certain<00:00:46.920> objects<00:00:47.370> through<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> axles<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
certain objects through the axles and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.160 
certain objects through the axles and
gearboxes<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:51.059> power<00:00:51.360> those<00:00:51.629> objects

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
gearboxes and they power those objects

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
gearboxes and they power those objects
so<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.610> basically<00:00:54.000> they're

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
so they can use them basically they're

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.209 
so they can use them basically they're
really<00:00:54.480> helpful<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.770> example<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
really helpful to like for example this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.729 
really helpful to like for example this
is<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.399> saw<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.020> basically<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> song<00:00:58.530> can

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
is a saw and basically what the song can

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
is a saw and basically what the song can
do<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> regular<00:00:59.609> wood<00:00:59.969> block

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
do and just take a regular wood block

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.930 
do and just take a regular wood block
and<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.260> into<00:01:01.410> panels<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.670> take

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and can put into panels you can take

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.530 
and can put into panels you can take
those<00:01:03.120> panels<00:01:04.189> going<00:01:05.189> further<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.420> make

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
those panels going further and can make

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
those panels going further and can make
molding<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.979> make<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> molding<00:01:08.760> even

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
molding you can make that molding even

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.950 
molding you can make that molding even
into<00:01:09.299> corners<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.390> even<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.750> pop<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
into corners and you can even just pop a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
into corners and you can even just pop a
corner<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> corner

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
corner right down here in the corner

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.610 
corner right down here in the corner
like<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.750> yep<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.130> basically

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
like that like so yep and so basically

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.730 
like that like so yep and so basically
that's<00:01:19.340> really<00:01:19.850> helpful<00:01:20.120> for<00:01:20.330> design<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.990> if

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's really helpful for design and if

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.200 
that's really helpful for design and if
you're<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.980> big<00:01:22.160> designer<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.700> Minecraft<00:01:23.090> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
you're a big designer in Minecraft and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.510 
you're a big designer in Minecraft and
all<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.510> now<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.930> don't<00:01:24.650> exactly<00:01:25.010> just<00:01:25.400> have

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
all that now you don't exactly just have

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.010 
all that now you don't exactly just have
the<00:01:25.610> power<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:26.120> water<00:01:26.420> wheel<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.900> can

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
the power with water wheel so you can

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.170 
the power with water wheel so you can
also<00:01:27.140> power<00:01:27.380> with<00:01:27.710> windmills<00:01:28.280> windmills<00:01:29.060> are

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
also power with windmills windmills are

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.330 
also power with windmills windmills are
very<00:01:29.300> helpful<00:01:29.540> if<00:01:29.780> you're<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.960> farmer<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.800> are

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
very helpful if you're a farmer and are

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.890 
very helpful if you're a farmer and are
really<00:01:31.460> big<00:01:31.730> into<00:01:31.880> wheat<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.390> all<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.690> and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
really big into wheat and all that and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.840 
really big into wheat and all that and
so<00:01:33.560> basically<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.100> happens<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
so basically what happens is the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.720 
so basically what happens is the
windmill<00:01:35.810> powers<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.800> gearboxes<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.460> they

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
windmill powers the gearboxes and they

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.250 
windmill powers the gearboxes and they
go<00:01:37.850> down<00:01:38.060> through<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.480> axes<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:38.930> come<00:01:39.110> to

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
go down through the axes then come to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.080 
go down through the axes then come to
the<00:01:39.290> Millstone<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.490> we<00:01:40.550> can<00:01:40.790> put<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the Millstone now we can put the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.290 
the Millstone now we can put the
Millstone<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:42.710> basically<00:01:43.400> wheat<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.790> wheat

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
Millstone is basically wheat and wheat

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.140 
Millstone is basically wheat and wheat
what<00:01:44.840> happens<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.260> wheat<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.880> turns

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
what happens to the wheat is that turns

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.990 
what happens to the wheat is that turns
into<00:01:47.270> flour<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.710> flower<00:01:48.980> once<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:49.910> comes

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
into flour and that flower once it comes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.480 
into flour and that flower once it comes
out<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.480> be<00:01:50.510> turned<00:01:50.720> into<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.960> lot<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.230> things

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
out can be turned into a lot of things

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.700 
out can be turned into a lot of things
such<00:01:52.490> as<00:01:52.520> donuts<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.480> bread<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:54.620> we'll

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
such as donuts and bread and but we'll

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.130 
such as donuts and bread and but we'll
get<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:54.950> later<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.660> as<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.110> see

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.220 
get to that later and as you can see
right<00:01:57.260> now<00:01:57.530> windmill<00:01:58.130> connects<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.230> already

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
right now windmill connects and already

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.300 
right now windmill connects and already
down<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.280> one<00:02:01.700> flower<00:02:01.940> ready<00:02:03.310> way

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
down here we have one flower ready way

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.400 
down here we have one flower ready way
for<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.580> other<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.970> which<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:05.960> should<00:02:06.380> have

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
for the other one which just should have

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.450 
for the other one which just should have
popped<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.770> yep<00:02:06.920> there<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.220> go<00:02:07.340> okay<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:09.460> so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
popped out yep there we go okay and so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.480 
popped out yep there we go okay and so
now<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:10.670> run<00:02:10.850> away<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.090> bocce<00:02:11.540> grills<00:02:11.870> now

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
now we run away to bocce grills now

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.680 
now we run away to bocce grills now
you'll<00:02:13.490> see<00:02:13.580> here<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.970> Boche<00:02:14.150> grill<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.600> a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
you'll see here the Boche grill in a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.230 
you'll see here the Boche grill in a
couple<00:02:14.990> seconds<00:02:15.350> but<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.520> hibachi<00:02:16.820> grill<00:02:17.150> is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
couple seconds but the hibachi grill is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.640 
couple seconds but the hibachi grill is
really<00:02:17.480> great<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:18.640> basically<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:21.500> just

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
really great because basically it's just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.630 
really great because basically it's just
a<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.700> power<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.000> using<00:02:23.270> redstone<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
a you can power it using redstone and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
a you can power it using redstone and
the<00:02:25.640> more<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.030> bocce<00:02:26.239> grills<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.690> have<00:02:26.840> them

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the more of bocce grills you have them

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.560 
the more of bocce grills you have them
the<00:02:27.470> faster<00:02:28.040> these<00:02:28.670> items<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> cauldron

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
the faster these items in the cauldron

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.380 
the faster these items in the cauldron
cooks<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.430> put<00:02:31.610> let's<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.330> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
cooks and if you put let's see if you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.110 
cooks and if you put let's see if you
put<00:02:32.570> flour<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.020> there<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:34.250> expect<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.820> oh<00:02:34.940> if

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
put flour in there you expect like oh if

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.430 
put flour in there you expect like oh if
it<00:02:35.270> just<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.660> know<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.020> just<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.230> massive

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
furnace will make bright but now it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.540 
furnace will make bright but now it
makes<00:02:38.000> donuts<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.070> that's<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:40.400> great

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
of Minecraft it basically made me play

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.630 
of Minecraft it basically made me play
singleplayer<00:02:48.470> world's<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.070> over<00:02:49.370> again

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
singleplayer world's all over again

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.820 
singleplayer world's all over again
because<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.420> wasn't<00:02:50.660> available<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.170> SMP<00:02:51.950> so

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
because it wasn't available in SMP so

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760 
because it wasn't available in SMP so
leave<00:02:54.830> there<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.870> let's<00:02:56.870> see<00:02:57.020> what's<00:02:57.350> next<00:02:57.530> oh

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
leave there and let's see what's next oh

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.030 
leave there and let's see what's next oh
yes<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.030> big<00:02:59.630> part<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.200> made<00:03:00.920> my

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
yes and this is a big part that made my

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.970 
yes and this is a big part that made my
jaw<00:03:01.280> drop<00:03:01.310> when<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.820> actually<00:03:01.970> did<00:03:02.269> see<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.540> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
jaw drop when I actually did see it and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.540 
jaw drop when I actually did see it and
basically<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.360> an<00:03:05.720> elevator<00:03:06.550> it's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
basically what it is is an elevator it's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.160 
basically what it is is an elevator it's
sense<00:03:07.850> it's<00:03:08.090> basically<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.660> platform

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
sense it's basically just a platform

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.930 
sense it's basically just a platform
that<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.530> raise<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.920> lower<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.820> can

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that you can raise and lower so you can

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.880 
that you can raise and lower so you can
just<00:03:10.970> go<00:03:11.239> into<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.570> mines<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.350> know<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.709> lot

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
just go into the mines you know a lot

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.860 
just go into the mines you know a lot
deeper<00:03:13.100> like<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.550> see<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:17.570> pretty

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
deeper like that see and it's pretty

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.560 
deeper like that see and it's pretty
easy<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.260> make<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.190> pulley<00:03:19.459> system<00:03:19.910> or<00:03:20.180> make

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
easy to make this pulley system or make

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.930 
easy to make this pulley system or make
this<00:03:20.660> elevator<00:03:21.080> system<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.650> I'll<00:03:22.610> probably

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
this elevator system and I'll probably

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.600 
this elevator system and I'll probably
show<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.989> later<00:03:24.230> video<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:24.800> right<00:03:25.430> now

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
show it in a later video but right now

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.759 
show it in a later video but right now
just<00:03:26.000> show<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> features<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.500> I'll

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
just show you all the features and I'll

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.310 
just show you all the features and I'll
get<00:03:27.890> into<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.100> details<00:03:28.400> later<00:03:28.519> now<00:03:29.359> this

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
get into the details later now this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620 
get into the details later now this
extremely<00:03:30.890> helpful<00:03:31.250> as<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:32.329> go<00:03:32.480> down

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
extremely helpful as you can go down

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.750 
extremely helpful as you can go down
deep<00:03:32.930> into<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.260> mine<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:34.010> know<00:03:34.100> maybe<00:03:34.310> slowly

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
deep into the mine you know maybe slowly

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.099 
deep into the mine you know maybe slowly
but<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.090> better<00:03:35.209> than<00:03:35.299> just<00:03:35.420> making<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.870> huge

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
but it's better than just making a huge

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.110 
but it's better than just making a huge
ladder<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:37.430> might<00:03:37.579> as<00:03:37.640> well<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.760> clear

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
ladder and you might as well just clear

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.140 
ladder and you might as well just clear
out<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.690> way<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.709> can<00:03:39.859> also<00:03:40.120> what<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
out this way and you can also what the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.610 
out this way and you can also what the
problem<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.570> with<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.079> can't<00:03:42.320> put<00:03:42.470> any

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
problem is with this you can't put any

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.280 
problem is with this you can't put any
other<00:03:42.829> blocks<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.430> say<00:03:43.730> now<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:44.570> want<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.930> keep

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
other blocks so say now we want to keep

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.229 
other blocks so say now we want to keep
a<00:03:45.440> chest<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.859> here<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.489> transport<00:03:46.940> up<00:03:47.090> and

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
a chest on here just to transport up and

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.310 
a chest on here just to transport up and
down<00:03:47.390> well<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.750> can't<00:03:47.930> do<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.170> in

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
down well you can't do that in

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.180 
down well you can't do that in
fortunately<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:51.320> know<00:03:51.440> that's<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.160> of

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
fortunately and you know that's one of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.500 
fortunately and you know that's one of
the<00:03:52.310> biggest<00:03:52.459> things<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.970> see<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> problem<00:03:53.389> with

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the biggest things I see a problem with

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.240 
the biggest things I see a problem with
but<00:03:53.840> see<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.350> know<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.530> can<00:03:54.709> go<00:03:54.829> into<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.070> mine

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
but see you know I can go into the mine

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.390 
but see you know I can go into the mine
here<00:03:55.790> or<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.959> before<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.410> had<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.650> fly<00:03:57.799> my<00:03:58.040> but

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
here or this before I had to fly my but

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.849 
here or this before I had to fly my but
that's<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.940> huge<00:03:59.209> ladder<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.660> there<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.590> yeah

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
that's a huge ladder up there but yeah

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.170 
that's a huge ladder up there but yeah
the<00:04:01.040> other<00:04:01.190> problem<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.609> that<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.120> not

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the other problem is that it's not

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.199 
the other problem is that it's not
there's<00:04:02.570> no<00:04:02.750> really<00:04:03.170> easy<00:04:03.410> way<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:04.609> get<00:04:04.820> back

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
there's no really easy way to get back

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.300 
there's no really easy way to get back
up<00:04:05.450> down<00:04:05.720> there<00:04:05.959> using<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.530> pulley<00:04:06.950> system

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
up down there using the pulley system

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.310 
up down there using the pulley system
because<00:04:07.609> it's<00:04:08.450> really<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.019> would<00:04:09.109> have<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
because it's really you would have to

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.199 
because it's really you would have to
wire<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.620> back<00:04:09.829> all<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.519> way<00:04:10.639> up<00:04:10.790> here<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
wire it back all the way up here and

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.580 
wire it back all the way up here and
even<00:04:11.359> then<00:04:11.720> I<00:04:11.750> wouldn't<00:04:12.170> know<00:04:12.230> what<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.380> do

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
even then I wouldn't know what to do

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.349 
even then I wouldn't know what to do
because<00:04:13.190> I'm<00:04:13.430> not<00:04:13.549> really<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.760> big<00:04:13.910> red<00:04:14.120> stone

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
because I'm not really a big red stone

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.960 
because I'm not really a big red stone
guy<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.130> would<00:04:16.130> really<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.489> no<00:04:16.639> clue<00:04:16.670> what

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
guy so I would really have no clue what

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.910 
guy so I would really have no clue what
to<00:04:17.060> do<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:18.070> also<00:04:19.070> going<00:04:19.549> back<00:04:19.790> in<00:04:19.940> here<00:04:20.709> if<00:04:21.709> it

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
to do and also going back in here if it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.360 
to do and also going back in here if it
gets<00:04:22.040> dark<00:04:22.280> out

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
gets dark out

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
gets dark out
you<00:04:23.940> know<00:04:24.060> you're<00:04:24.240> probably<00:04:24.330> wondering<00:04:24.750> what

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
you know you're probably wondering what

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.480 
you know you're probably wondering what
these<00:04:24.930> yellow<00:04:25.320> blocks<00:04:25.560> when<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.919> first<00:04:26.100> came<00:04:26.310> in

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
these yellow blocks when I first came in

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.280 
these yellow blocks when I first came in
here<00:04:26.520> now<00:04:27.180> these<00:04:27.389> yellow<00:04:27.810> things<00:04:27.840> are

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
here now these yellow things are

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.490 
here now these yellow things are
actually<00:04:28.800> lights<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:30.270> no<00:04:30.810> need<00:04:30.960> for<00:04:31.169> torches

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
actually lights so no need for torches

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.159 
actually lights so no need for torches
anymore<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.270> these<00:04:33.270> lights<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:33.720> amazing

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
anymore and these lights are amazing

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.150 
anymore and these lights are amazing
really<00:04:34.350> because<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:36.600> know<00:04:36.750> they<00:04:37.229> actually<00:04:37.380> do

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
really because you know they actually do

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.800 
really because you know they actually do
that<00:04:38.880> block<00:04:39.180> where<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.419> could<00:04:39.540> have<00:04:39.630> put<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
that block where you could have put the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.120 
that block where you could have put the
torch<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:40.470> put<00:04:40.590> lights<00:04:40.830> lights

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
torch on you can put lights lights

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.580 
torch on you can put lights lights
actually<00:04:41.460> look<00:04:41.610> better<00:04:41.660> also<00:04:42.660> they're<00:04:43.020> pretty

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
actually look better also they're pretty

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.180 
actually look better also they're pretty
much<00:04:43.740> required<00:04:44.040> for<00:04:44.639> growing<00:04:45.120> hemp<00:04:45.449> which<00:04:45.810> is

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
much required for growing hemp which is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.820 
much required for growing hemp which is
necessary<00:04:47.190> for<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:48.120> rope<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:49.710> know

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
necessary for the rope and you know

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.320 
necessary for the rope and you know
let's<00:04:50.729> see<00:04:50.850> what's<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.120> called<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:53.330> hemp

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
let's see what's it called and hemp

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
let's see what's it called and hemp
fibers<00:04:54.750> obviously<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:56.220> make<00:04:57.199> gearboxes<00:04:58.199> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
fibers obviously to make gearboxes and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.129 
fibers obviously to make gearboxes and
axles<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.789> hemp<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.510> pretty<00:05:00.780> much<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:00.960> necessity

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
axles so hemp is pretty much a necessity

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.219 
axles so hemp is pretty much a necessity
in<00:05:01.710> this<00:05:01.830> game<00:05:02.039> or<00:05:02.729> else<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:04.050> know<00:05:04.169> you

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
in this game or else you know you

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.250 
in this game or else you know you
probably<00:05:04.560> wouldn't<00:05:04.830> go<00:05:04.919> anywhere<00:05:05.220> else<00:05:05.430> so

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
probably wouldn't go anywhere else so

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.750 
probably wouldn't go anywhere else so
those<00:05:07.260> are<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.410> basic<00:05:07.889> features<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.580> want

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
those are the basic features that I want

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.640 
those are the basic features that I want
to<00:05:08.820> show<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.060> guys<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:10.139> video<00:05:10.289> I'll

to show you guys in this video I'll

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.840 
to show you guys in this video I'll
probably<00:05:10.770> put<00:05:10.979> out<00:05:11.100> another<00:05:11.250> video<00:05:11.460> showing

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
probably put out another video showing

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.810 
probably put out another video showing
the<00:05:11.970> rest<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.139> them<00:05:13.289> but<00:05:13.530> just<00:05:14.490> remember<00:05:14.580> to
