00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.259 

so<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:07.109> seaplane<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.580> built

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
so this is on the seaplane and I built

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.110 
so this is on the seaplane and I built
it<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> delta<00:00:10.620> wing<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:11.010> first<00:00:11.309> but<00:00:11.910> that

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
it with a delta wing at first but that

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
it with a delta wing at first but that
didn't<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.480> work<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.830> put<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.309> new

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
didn't really work so I put this new

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.180 
didn't really work so I put this new
wing<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.179> oh<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> slow

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
wing on it oh it's just like a slow

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.980 
wing on it oh it's just like a slow
trainer<00:00:17.490> wing<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.090> motor<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:18.720> it's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
trainer wing the motor in the back it's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.429 
trainer wing the motor in the back it's
a<00:00:19.050> 22<00:00:19.470> 1206<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:21.000> got<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> 2200<00:00:21.990> milliamp

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a 22 1206 and it's got a 2200 milliamp

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
a 22 1206 and it's got a 2200 milliamp
3-cell<00:00:22.830> battery<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> bottom<00:00:24.840> it's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
3-cell battery and on the bottom it's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
3-cell battery and on the bottom it's
all<00:00:25.109> taped<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> step<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.490> we'll<00:00:26.670> just

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
all taped up with the step so we'll just

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:49.979 
all taped up with the step so we'll just
Maydan<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.570> grass<00:00:27.869> first

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.780 

so<00:00:50.989> it's<00:00:51.199> still<00:00:51.440> really<00:00:51.770> weird<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.489> pitch

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
so it's still really weird on the pitch

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.509 
so it's still really weird on the pitch
um<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.809> motors<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.379> back<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.949> hone<00:00:55.160> like

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
um the motors in the back so hone like

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.000 
um the motors in the back so hone like
pulls<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.970> back<00:00:56.120> up<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:57.260> has<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.710> little

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
pulls the back up and it has a little

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.770 
pulls the back up and it has a little
bit<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.219> down<00:00:58.370> thrust<00:00:58.760> but<00:00:59.059> I<00:00:59.120> also<00:00:59.360> had<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.600> put

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
bit of down thrust but I also had to put

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.389 
bit of down thrust but I also had to put
these<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.079> permanent<00:01:00.649> thrust<00:01:01.010> vectoring

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
these like permanent thrust vectoring

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.640 
these like permanent thrust vectoring
little<00:01:01.730> tabs<00:01:02.000> there<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.540> that<00:01:03.409> still<00:01:03.620> doesn't

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
little tabs there and that still doesn't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.380 
little tabs there and that still doesn't
help<00:01:03.890> too<00:01:04.159> much<00:01:04.369> because<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.879> plan<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.239> really

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
help too much because the plan is really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:17.260 
help too much because the plan is really
squirrely<00:01:05.990> on<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.259> pitch<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.880> since<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
squirrely on the pitch so since the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.210 
squirrely on the pitch so since the
motor<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.690> in<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.929> back<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.710> like<00:01:18.830> up<00:01:19.009> high

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
motor is in the back and I like up high

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.279 
motor is in the back and I like up high
it<00:01:19.490> kind<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.729> pulls<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.270> front<00:01:20.570> down<00:01:20.840> and

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
it kind of pulls the front down and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.680 
it kind of pulls the front down and
pulls<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.619> back<00:01:21.740> up<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.759> um<00:01:23.060> what<00:01:23.539> do<00:01:23.630> you

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
pulls the back up so um what do you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.410 
pulls the back up so um what do you
think<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.380> do<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.800> fix<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.280> problem<00:01:25.520> it's

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
think I can do to fix this problem it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:52.469 
think I can do to fix this problem it's
gonna<00:01:26.509> float<00:01:26.869> on<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.020> water<00:01:27.140> okay

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.479 

yeah
