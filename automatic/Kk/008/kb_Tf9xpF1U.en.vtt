00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
major thing being able to sync

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.060 
major thing being able to sync
wirelessly<00:03:25.090> I'm<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.290> definitely<00:03:26.650> think<00:03:26.890> it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
wirelessly I'm I definitely think it's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.729 
wirelessly I'm I definitely think it's
worth<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.640> 999<00:03:28.390> support<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.050> dev<00:03:29.290> he's

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
worth it so 999 support the dev he's

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.050 
worth it so 999 support the dev he's
worked<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.280> hard<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.030> I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
worked really hard on it and I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.729 
worked really hard on it and I
definitely<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:31.780> worth<00:03:31.810> getting<00:03:32.320> in

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
definitely think it's worth getting in

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.530 
definitely think it's worth getting in
cydia<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.820> 999<00:03:34.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:35.050> sync<00:03:35.400> um<00:03:36.400> get<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.239> in
