for a while you'll notice they've

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
for a while you'll notice they've
actually<00:00:14.280> updated<00:00:15.059> their<00:00:15.240> garage<00:00:15.570> equipment

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
actually updated their garage equipment

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.380 
actually updated their garage equipment
and<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.010> quite<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.270> thought

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and it's quite a bit there so we thought

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.990 
and it's quite a bit there so we thought
of<00:00:18.449> rails<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.289> select<00:00:19.680> something<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
of rails and select something what we

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.620 
of rails and select something what we
found<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.510> PSB<00:00:22.260> 10<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.240> 10<00:00:24.240> gallon

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
for a guided tour first of all we have a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.280 
for a guided tour first of all we have a
pressure<00:01:19.020> relief<00:01:19.710> valve<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
pressure relief valve which is set to

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.190 
pressure relief valve which is set to
125<00:01:22.290> psi<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.130> safety<00:01:23.640> purposes<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.450> yes<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
125 psi for safety purposes and yes it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.920 
125 psi for safety purposes and yes it
does<00:01:25.409> work<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:26.610> run<00:01:27.030> pressure<00:01:27.360> through<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
does work we run pressure through it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 
does work we run pressure through it
which<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.229> higher<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.680> 125<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
which was higher than 125 and it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
which was higher than 125 and it
certainly<00:01:30.509> did<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> job<00:01:31.049> ok<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:32.100> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
certainly did the job ok which is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.819 
certainly did the job ok which is
vitally<00:01:33.000> important<00:01:33.470> after<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> pressure

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
vitally important after the pressure

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
vitally important after the pressure
valve<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.150> cap<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
valve here we have the cap which is a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.679 
valve here we have the cap which is a
very<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.400> made<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> has<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
very well made and it has to be to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.319 
very well made and it has to be to
withstand<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> pressure<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
withstand the pressure at up here you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.780 
withstand the pressure at up here you
pour<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.899> your<00:01:42.930> sand<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> beads<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
pour in your sand or the beads that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
pour in your sand or the beads that
you're<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.000> use<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.380> sandblasting<00:01:46.380> we're

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you're gonna use for sandblasting we're

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.990 
you're gonna use for sandblasting we're
using<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.340> kiln-dried<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.299> silica<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
using a kiln-dried and silica here and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.819 
using a kiln-dried and silica here and
once<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.299> been<00:01:51.780> filled<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.409> has<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> be

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
once it's been filled it has to be

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.090 
once it's been filled it has to be
locked<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.220> quite<00:01:53.820> tightly<00:01:54.799> that's<00:01:55.799> why<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
locked down quite tightly that's why it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
locked down quite tightly that's why it
has<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.520> bar<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> cap<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
has this bar on the cap there right so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100 
has this bar on the cap there right so
we<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.490> 3/8<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> an<00:02:00.090> inch<00:02:00.180> taps<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
we have a 3/8 of an inch taps all the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.990 
we have a 3/8 of an inch taps all the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
an air fitting on the end all you have

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.360 
an air fitting on the end all you have
is<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.159> union<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.379> do<00:02:31.440> give<00:02:32.129> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
is a union here but they do give you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.600 
is a union here but they do give you
some<00:02:32.730> type<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> PTFE<00:02:34.590> tape<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.099> stop

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
some type which is a PTFE tape to stop

some type which is a PTFE tape to stop
any<00:02:36.000> leaks<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.290> reason<00:02:37.590> they<00:02:37.709> don't<00:02:37.950> give

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
any leaks and the reason they don't give

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.100 
any leaks and the reason they don't give
you<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> fitting<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.450> because<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:39.959> so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
you a fitting here is because there's so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
you a fitting here is because there's so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
many choices of air coupling this one

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.410 
many choices of air coupling this one
here<00:02:42.659> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> PCL<00:02:43.440> coupling<00:02:43.950> which<00:02:44.420> basically

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
here is a PCL coupling which basically

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.539 
here is a PCL coupling which basically
all<00:02:45.840> my<00:02:45.870> tools<00:02:46.319> are<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.829> one<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
all my tools are on this one so it's

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.119 
all my tools are on this one so it's
logical<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> keep<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.629> way<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:49.829> air

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
logical to keep it that way the air

pressure and you can see by this it will

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.240 
pressure and you can see by this it will
actually<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:58.349> past<00:02:58.709> one<00:02:58.920> hundred<00:02:58.950> and

actually go past one hundred and
twenty-five<00:02:59.970> but<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.780> will<00:03:01.319> only<00:03:01.500> allow<00:03:01.739> one

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
so we're using kiln-dried sand here

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.290 
so we're using kiln-dried sand here
which<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:55.010> just<00:04:55.040> grabbed<00:04:55.520> from<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.940> local

dealers motor factors 25 kilograms you

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.580 
dealers motor factors 25 kilograms you
can<00:05:00.500> use<00:05:00.710> other<00:05:01.010> materials<00:05:01.840> without<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:03.080> minyan

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
can use other materials without a minyan

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.530 
can use other materials without a minyan
okay<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.130> can<00:05:04.460> see<00:05:04.730> here<00:05:05.090> how<00:05:05.270> are<00:05:05.450> the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
okay you can see here how are the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.720 
okay you can see here how are the
minimis<00:05:05.930> before<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.500> sound<00:05:06.710> blasted<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.520> then

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
minimis before it sound blasted and then

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.840 
minimis before it sound blasted and then
afterwards<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:09.260> doesn't<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.190> oily<00:05:10.700> greasy

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
afterwards it doesn't like oily greasy

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.390 
afterwards it doesn't like oily greasy
surfaces<00:05:11.390> as<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.080> can<00:05:12.260> see<00:05:12.500> here<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:13.100> it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
surfaces as you can see here but it

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.380 
surfaces as you can see here but it
leaves<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.940> dull<00:05:14.300> finish<00:05:15.070> also<00:05:16.390> sandblasting

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
leaves a dull finish also sandblasting

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.540 
leaves a dull finish also sandblasting
is<00:05:17.600> very<00:05:18.200> wasteful<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:18.950> can<00:05:19.100> see<00:05:19.280> how<00:05:19.430> much

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
is very wasteful you can see how much

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.870 
is very wasteful you can see how much
sand<00:05:19.880> is<00:05:20.060> wasted<00:05:20.840> here<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.650> almost<00:05:22.130> about<00:05:22.460> five

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
sand is wasted here in almost about five

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.930 
sand is wasted here in almost about five
minutes<00:05:23.540> okay<00:05:24.410> so<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.070> really<00:05:25.460> need<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.730> build

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
minutes okay so you really need to build

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.940 
minutes okay so you really need to build
yourself<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.540> containment<00:05:27.050> area<00:05:27.680> where<00:05:27.860> you

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
yourself a containment area where you

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.100 
yourself a containment area where you
can<00:05:28.160> collect<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.820> then<00:05:29.060> re<00:05:29.300> filter<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.810> sand

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
can collect and then re filter the sand

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.350 
can collect and then re filter the sand
and<00:05:30.320> put<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.710> back<00:05:31.010> into<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.760> container<00:05:32.090> and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
and put it back into the container and

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.750 
and put it back into the container and
reuse<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.560> other<00:05:33.860> option<00:05:34.340> if<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.610> can

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
reuse it the other option if you can

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.810 
reuse it the other option if you can
afford<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.390> SBC<00:05:36.140> a<00:05:36.169> 220<00:05:37.040> which<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.520> steel

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
afford it is SBC a 220 which is a steel

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.090 
afford it is SBC a 220 which is a steel
blast<00:05:38.300> cabinet<00:05:38.960> which<00:05:39.500> will<00:05:39.710> contain<00:05:40.040> the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
blast cabinet which will contain the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.100 
blast cabinet which will contain the
sand<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:40.700> can<00:05:40.850> collect<00:05:41.180> at<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.419> bomb<00:05:41.750> and

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
sand you can collect at the bomb and

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.360 
sand you can collect at the bomb and
then<00:05:42.620> reuse<00:05:42.919> it

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
then reuse it

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.790 
then reuse it
okay<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:44.090> emptying<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.080> I'm<00:05:45.260> gonna<00:05:45.470> have<00:05:45.560> to

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
okay so emptying it I'm gonna have to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.470 
okay so emptying it I'm gonna have to
show<00:05:46.040> you<00:05:46.100> this<00:05:46.280> if<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.490> buy<00:05:46.760> one<00:05:47.000> of<00:05:47.030> these<00:05:47.210> is

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
gone down to zero you can then evacuate

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.630 
gone down to zero you can then evacuate
the<00:06:03.260> tank<00:06:03.560> but<00:06:03.770> there<00:06:03.980> will<00:06:04.100> still<00:06:04.430> be<00:06:04.490> a

that<00:06:18.169> can<00:06:18.320> come<00:06:18.770> we've<00:06:19.669> taken<00:06:19.940> this<00:06:20.150> sort<00:06:20.419> of

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
that can come we've taken this sort of

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.480 
that can come we've taken this sort of
equipment<00:06:21.110> you<00:06:21.350> need<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.620> medium<00:06:22.250> sized

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
equipment you need a medium sized

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.820 
equipment you need a medium sized
compressor<00:06:23.000> and<00:06:23.630> not<00:06:23.840> a<00:06:23.870> little<00:06:24.229> LD<00:06:24.650> special

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.710 
compressor and not a little LD special
I've<00:06:26.280> got<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.580> say<00:06:26.759> that<00:06:27.000> this<00:06:27.150> is<00:06:27.360> one<00:06:27.509> way<00:06:27.539> of

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
I've got to say that this is one way of

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.170 
I've got to say that this is one way of
cleaning<00:06:28.199> rust<00:06:28.470> off<00:06:28.710> equipment<00:06:29.129> very<00:06:29.879> very

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
cleaning rust off equipment very very

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.860 
cleaning rust off equipment very very
quickly<00:06:30.710> this<00:06:31.710> is<00:06:31.919> actually<00:06:32.490> quite

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
quickly this is actually quite

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.180 
quickly this is actually quite
labor-intensive<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:34.050> remove<00:06:34.409> rust<00:06:34.710> whereas<00:06:35.129> a

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
labor-intensive to remove rust whereas a

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.369 
labor-intensive to remove rust whereas a
sample<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.699> stirrer<00:06:35.940> will<00:06:36.060> do<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.569> very<00:06:37.169> very

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
sample a stirrer will do it very very

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.589 
sample a stirrer will do it very very
proficiently<00:06:38.310> however<00:06:39.210> you've<00:06:39.419> got<00:06:39.449> to

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
proficiently however you've got to

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.420 
proficiently however you've got to
remember<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.169> cost<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:40.770> this<00:06:40.889> could<00:06:41.250> be

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
remember the cost of this could be

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.129 
remember the cost of this could be
prohibitive<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.360> unless<00:06:42.599> you<00:06:42.900> have<00:06:42.930> a

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
prohibitive and unless you have a

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.890 
prohibitive and unless you have a
compressor<00:06:43.740> already<00:06:44.099> in<00:06:44.250> your<00:06:44.400> workshop<00:06:44.900> okay

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
compressor already in your workshop okay

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.300 
compressor already in your workshop okay
so<00:06:45.960> we're<00:06:46.229> going<00:06:46.349> to<00:06:46.409> give<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.710> thumbs<00:06:46.979> up<00:06:47.159> on

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
so we're going to give the thumbs up on

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.520 
so we're going to give the thumbs up on
this<00:06:47.520> one<00:06:47.759> again<00:06:47.970> for<00:06:48.330> paddocks<00:06:49.050> coming<00:06:49.409> up

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
this one again for paddocks coming up

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.940 
this one again for paddocks coming up
trumps<00:06:50.069> with<00:06:50.250> decent<00:06:50.669> tools
