00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:11.430 

I<00:00:07.950> get<00:00:08.950> a<00:00:09.160> lot<00:00:09.429> you<00:00:09.910> don't<00:00:10.030> look<00:00:10.300> like<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.929> boxer

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
I get a lot you don't look like a boxer

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.720 
I get a lot you don't look like a boxer
I'm<00:00:11.679> not<00:00:11.980> sure<00:00:12.129> what

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
I'm not sure what

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.190 
I'm not sure what
and<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:12.910> look<00:00:13.030> like<00:00:13.240> but<00:00:13.450> I'm<00:00:13.570> assuming

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
and to look like but I'm assuming

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:24.220 
and to look like but I'm assuming
I<00:00:20.920> had<00:00:21.920> a<00:00:22.000> pretty<00:00:23.000> hard<00:00:23.360> upbringing<00:00:23.840> my<00:00:24.020> dad

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
I had a pretty hard upbringing my dad

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.650 
I had a pretty hard upbringing my dad
died<00:00:24.470> when<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.770> was<00:00:24.800> 2<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:25.160> my<00:00:25.550> mum<00:00:25.759> went<00:00:26.360> to<00:00:26.570> all

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
died when I was 2 and my mum went to all

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.230 
died when I was 2 and my mum went to all
the<00:00:26.779> wrong<00:00:26.930> things<00:00:27.160> she<00:00:28.160> ended<00:00:28.310> up<00:00:28.400> dying<00:00:28.610> of<00:00:28.849> a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
the wrong things she ended up dying of a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.889 
the wrong things she ended up dying of a
heroin<00:00:29.810> overdose<00:00:30.169> so<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:30.919> guess<00:00:31.360> for<00:00:32.360> me<00:00:32.419> I've

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
heroin overdose so I guess for me I've

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.290 
heroin overdose so I guess for me I've
never<00:00:32.960> had<00:00:33.710> anything<00:00:33.950> come<00:00:34.220> easy<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:34.730> that's

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
never had anything come easy and that's

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.810 
never had anything come easy and that's
how<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:36.230> think<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.710> relate<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.130> boxing<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:37.640> not

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
how I think I relate to boxing it's not

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.819 
how I think I relate to boxing it's not
it's<00:00:38.000> hard<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:38.510> everything<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.559> want<00:00:39.739> in

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
it's hard it everything you want in

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.190 
it's hard it everything you want in
boxing<00:00:40.130> it's<00:00:40.370> hard<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.790> every<00:00:41.090> every<00:00:41.480> part<00:00:41.510> of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
boxing it's hard you every every part of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.260 
boxing it's hard you every every part of
boxing<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.770> hard<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:43.760> guess<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.149> how

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
boxing is hard and so I guess that's how

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.180 
boxing is hard and so I guess that's how
I<00:00:44.300> relate<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.719> it<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.079> it's<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.710> know<00:00:45.829> I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
I relate to it is it's what I know I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:01:07.820 
I relate to it is it's what I know I
don't<00:00:47.030> know<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.330> yes

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
I first started with with ACP mac-10 the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700 
I first started with with ACP mac-10 the
infrared<00:02:13.020> infrared<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.230> used<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.500> call<00:02:14.620> it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
infrared infrared I used to call it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.300 
infrared infrared I used to call it
infrared<00:02:15.070> scans<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.230> my<00:02:17.470> lifesaver

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
infrared scans it was like my lifesaver

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.950 
infrared scans it was like my lifesaver
I'd<00:02:18.550> never<00:02:18.760> had<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> pre-workout<00:02:19.360> before<00:02:19.840> I'd

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.430 
never I've never tried anything and when
I<00:02:21.760> got<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.390> was<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:22.780> instant<00:02:23.140> energy

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
I got that it was just instant energy
