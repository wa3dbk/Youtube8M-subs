their cakes with a little bottle of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
their cakes with a little bottle of
water<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
water and this is the way that we use to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420 
water and this is the way that we use to
do<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.719> no<00:00:49.350> longer<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.219> way

have to press down on the pump as you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
have to press down on the pump as you
know<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.180> irregular<00:00:57.870> spray<00:00:58.350> of

more<00:01:00.510> water<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:01.079> others<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
more water than others and this is why a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
more water than others and this is why a
lot<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> us<00:01:03.449> suffer<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.409> air<00:01:04.710> bubbles
