00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.060 
armored tab or some people call it the O
tab<00:00:10.139> because<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.590> open<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
tab because you can open it with the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.740 
tab because you can open it with the
arrow<00:00:11.160> key<00:00:11.309> obviously<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.420> messes

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
arrow key obviously this kind of messes

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.470 
arrow key obviously this kind of messes
with<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.139> nei<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> prefer<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
with the nei a little bit so I prefer to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
with the nei a little bit so I prefer to
use<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.020> tab<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.160> basically<00:00:17.580> it's

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
use just the tab here and basically it's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.840 
use just the tab here and basically it's
got<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.970> these<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.300> fancy<00:00:18.810> slots<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
got all these like fancy slots and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.920 
got all these like fancy slots and
people<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.939> been<00:00:21.060> wondering<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> hell

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
people have been wondering what the hell

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.160 
people have been wondering what the hell
is<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.070> things<00:00:23.279> basically<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
is with these things basically and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.599 
is with these things basically and
basically<00:00:25.170> only<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> them<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.220> usable

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
basically only two of them are usable

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
basically only two of them are usable
there's<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> information<00:00:27.900> around

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
there's not a lot of information around

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.460 
there's not a lot of information around
but<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:29.550> checked<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> mod<00:00:30.840> files<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
but I've checked with the mod files and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
but I've checked with the mod files and
it<00:00:32.070> will<00:00:32.160> seem<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.669> there's<00:00:33.090> only<00:00:33.329> two

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it will seem that there's only two

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
it will seem that there's only two
usable<00:00:34.020> items<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.489> one

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
usable items in them now the first one

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
usable items in them now the first one
is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.059> knapsack<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.860> basically<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> put<00:00:38.160> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
is a knapsack and basically you put this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
is a knapsack and basically you put this
in<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> knapsack<00:00:38.790> slot<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:40.200> opens<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> new

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
in the knapsack slot and it opens a new

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
in the knapsack slot and it opens a new
tab<00:00:40.739> where<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.280> put<00:00:41.520> stuff<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tab where you can put stuff so it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.420 
tab where you can put stuff so it's
basically<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.450> an<00:00:42.870> extra<00:00:43.290> chest<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
basically like an extra chest for your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.260 
basically like an extra chest for your
inventory<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:46.200> second<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> these<00:00:47.760> heart

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
inventory the second one is these heart

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
inventory the second one is these heart
Castor's<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> each<00:00:49.559> heart<00:00:49.829> caster<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.430> give

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Castor's and each heart caster will give

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.799 
Castor's and each heart caster will give
you<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.320> extra<00:00:52.320> heart<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.039> heart<00:00:53.219> bar

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
you a extra heart for your heart bar

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
you a extra heart for your heart bar
basically<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.500> essentially<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
basically so you can essentially if you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
basically so you can essentially if you
manage<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.360> stack<00:00:57.600> ten<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
manage to stack ten of them which is the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
manage to stack ten of them which is the
max<00:00:58.680> amount<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> glitch<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.270> I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
max amount there is a glitch to get I

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
max amount there is a glitch to get I
believe<00:01:00.719> 64<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> them<00:01:01.789> but<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
believe 64 of them but I'm not going to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
believe 64 of them but I'm not going to
cover<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.470> search

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cover that if you want to just search

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
cover that if you want to just search
around<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.129> you'll<00:01:05.309> find<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> feel

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
around and you'll find it but I feel

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
around and you'll find it but I feel
that<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> chichi<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that it's a little bit kind of chichi so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
that it's a little bit kind of chichi so
yeah<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.320> shove<00:01:10.530> these<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
yeah you can just shove these in the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
yeah you can just shove these in the
heart<00:01:11.130> slot<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.670> right-click<00:01:11.850> them

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
heart slot or you can right-click them

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
heart slot or you can right-click them
and<00:01:12.330> they'll<00:01:12.990> you'll<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:14.130> you'll<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and they'll you'll see you'll see I you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
and they'll you'll see you'll see I you
know<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.390> extra<00:01:15.590> bar<00:01:16.590> filling<00:01:16.920> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
know I have like an extra bar filling up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
know I have like an extra bar filling up
over<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> top<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:18.030> normal<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.320> instead

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
over the top of my normal one so instead

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
over the top of my normal one so instead
of<00:01:19.710> having<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> maximum<00:01:20.130> 20<00:01:20.790> health<00:01:20.970> even

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of having the maximum 20 health even

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.270 
of having the maximum 20 health even
though<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.320> 10<00:01:22.650> hearts<00:01:22.860> each<00:01:23.070> half

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
though you have 10 hearts each half

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
though you have 10 hearts each half
heart<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> worth<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.930> health<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
heart is worth two health because of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
heart is worth two health because of
course<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.400> half<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> heart

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
course you have half a heart

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
course you have half a heart
you<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.229> 40<00:01:28.560> hearts<00:01:28.799> uh-huh<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you now have 40 hearts uh-huh so it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.109 
you now have 40 hearts uh-huh so it
basically<00:01:30.180> increases<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.960> survivability<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
basically increases your survivability a

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.480 
basically increases your survivability a
bunch<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.810> way<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> craft<00:01:34.259> these<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
bunch and the way you craft these is you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
bunch and the way you craft these is you
the<00:01:36.270> first<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> knapsack<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> craft

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the first one the knapsack you can craft

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
the first one the knapsack you can craft
using<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.530> fuel<00:01:40.530> every<00:01:40.710> top<00:01:40.950> three<00:01:41.280> level<00:01:41.549> at

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
using the fuel every top three level at

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
using the fuel every top three level at
bottom<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.509> tough<00:01:43.170> iron<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.920> rods

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
bottom these are tough iron two rods

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
bottom these are tough iron two rods
which<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.939> build<00:01:45.210> using<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> smeltery<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
which you build using the smeltery and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
which you build using the smeltery and
in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> middle<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.420> use<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.990> gold<00:01:49.380> ingot

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
in the middle you can use a gold ingot

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.840 
in the middle you can use a gold ingot
or<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> aluminium<00:01:50.939> brass<00:01:51.869> ingot<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.500> believe<00:01:52.850> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
or a aluminium brass ingot I believe and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.100 
or a aluminium brass ingot I believe and
the<00:01:54.829> actual<00:01:55.969> half<00:01:56.969> containers<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.810> build

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the actual half containers you build

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.399 
the actual half containers you build
using<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.119> necrotic<00:02:00.119> bone<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.170> dropped

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
using a necrotic bone this is dropped

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
using a necrotic bone this is dropped
from<00:02:01.530> wither<00:02:02.040> skeletons<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.909> you're<00:02:03.540> probably

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
from wither skeletons so you're probably

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.120 
from wither skeletons so you're probably
new<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> farm<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> nether<00:02:04.710> quite<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> bit

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
new to farm in the nether quite a bit

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.880 
new to farm in the nether quite a bit
the<00:02:06.000> miniature<00:02:06.659> heart<00:02:06.960> containers<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> these

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the miniature heart containers and these

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.729 
the miniature heart containers and these
drop<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.489> by<00:02:08.819> random<00:02:08.970> mobs<00:02:09.530> you'll<00:02:10.530> probably

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
drop just by random mobs you'll probably

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
drop just by random mobs you'll probably
find<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.190> few<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.730> along<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.209> jeweled

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
find a few as you go along a jeweled

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
find a few as you go along a jeweled
Apple

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
Apple

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
Apple
is<00:02:13.890> actually<00:02:14.010> surprisingly<00:02:14.460> easy<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> get<00:02:15.210> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
is actually surprisingly easy to get you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.870 
is actually surprisingly easy to get you
just<00:02:15.450> need<00:02:15.690> an<00:02:15.780> apple<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.670> surround<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.850> with

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
just need an apple and surround it with

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.210 
just need an apple and surround it with
four<00:02:18.240> diamonds<00:02:18.620> kind<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.710> in<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.830> cross<00:02:20.010> shape

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
four diamonds kind of in a cross shape

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.850 
four diamonds kind of in a cross shape
and<00:02:20.630> then<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.170> empty<00:02:22.590> heart

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
and then you just have this empty heart

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.370 
and then you just have this empty heart
container<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.930> made<00:02:24.930> from<00:02:25.050> for

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
container which is made from for

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
container which is made from for
aluminium<00:02:25.910> ingots<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.450> get<00:02:27.540> from<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
aluminium ingots which you get from the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.390 
aluminium ingots which you get from the
smeltery<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.500> craft<00:02:28.710> them<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.070> four

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
smeltery and just craft them in a four

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
smeltery and just craft them in a four
by<00:02:29.490> four<00:02:29.520> read<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.600> were<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
by four read that you were there and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.010 
by four read that you were there and
you'll<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> yeah<00:02:33.540> basically<00:02:33.750> this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you'll get that so yeah basically this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.650 
you'll get that so yeah basically this
is<00:02:34.140> quite<00:02:34.350> easy<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.530> make<00:02:34.620> whereas<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.250> is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
is quite easy to make whereas this is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
is quite easy to make whereas this is
mainly<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.780> neck<00:02:37.080> rhotic<00:02:37.350> bones<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.890> feel<00:02:38.100> or

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
mainly the neck rhotic bones I feel or

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.070 
mainly the neck rhotic bones I feel or
the<00:02:38.400> hard<00:02:38.640> part<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.240> well<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.540> well<00:02:39.750> it's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the hard part here as well as well it's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.840 
the hard part here as well as well it's
mainly<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.740> mob<00:02:40.890> drops<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.490> side<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
mainly the the mob drops on this side of

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.770 
mainly the the mob drops on this side of
the<00:02:42.500> item<00:02:43.500> frames<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.730> yeah<00:02:44.910> I'll<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:45.750> show

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the item frames so yeah I'll now show

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.340 
the item frames so yeah I'll now show
you<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.590> quick<00:02:46.830> screenshot<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:48.170> what's<00:02:49.170> in

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
you just a quick screenshot of what's in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.680 
you just a quick screenshot of what's in
the<00:02:49.380> armour<00:02:49.980> folder<00:02:50.820> for<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.360> mod<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the armour folder for this mod and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.860 
the armour folder for this mod and
basically<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.590> will<00:02:52.710> show<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
basically this will show you that the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.380 
basically this will show you that the
eye<00:02:54.900> essentially<00:02:55.800> it's<00:02:56.160> because<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.270> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
eye essentially it's because it's a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.720 
eye essentially it's because it's a
tinkers<00:02:57.750> construct<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:59.100> looks<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.550> mod

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
tinkers construct it looks like the mod

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.550 
tinkers construct it looks like the mod
author<00:02:59.910> has<00:03:00.180> planned<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.690> release<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.110> lot<00:03:01.380> more

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
author has planned to release a lot more

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.340 
author has planned to release a lot more
for<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.800> mod<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.850> empty<00:03:03.390> glove<00:03:04.050> clasp

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
for this mod there's a empty glove clasp

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.690 
for this mod there's a empty glove clasp
and<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.960> just<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.050> base<00:03:07.200> class<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.430> obvious

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
and a just a base class so it's obvious

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.640 
and a just a base class so it's obvious
that<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.910> plans<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.300> release<00:03:09.390> more<00:03:09.660> stuff<00:03:09.990> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that you plans to release more stuff to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
that you plans to release more stuff to
fill<00:03:10.890> up<00:03:10.980> these<00:03:11.130> slots<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.580> actually<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:11.940> a

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
fill up these slots and actually have a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.150 
fill up these slots and actually have a
use<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.990> they're<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.200> implemented<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.920> this

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
use but they're not implemented in this

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.970 
use but they're not implemented in this
version<00:03:14.820> or<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.420> believe<00:03:16.050> any<00:03:16.290> version<00:03:16.560> that's

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
version or I believe any version that's

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.550 
version or I believe any version that's
currently<00:03:17.400> available<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:18.000> tinkers<00:03:18.330> construct

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
currently available if tinkers construct

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.260 
currently available if tinkers construct
so<00:03:19.560> yeah<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.550> into<00:03:20.700> your<00:03:20.790> mod<00:03:21.030> files

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
so yeah you can go into your mod files

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.120 
so yeah you can go into your mod files
and<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> look<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.170> hopefully

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
and have a look at it and hopefully

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.740 
and have a look at it and hopefully
there'll<00:03:23.520> be<00:03:23.580> some<00:03:23.640> content<00:03:24.300> first<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.660> we

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
there'll be some content first so we

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.900 
there'll be some content first so we
actually<00:03:25.130> understand<00:03:26.130> what's<00:03:26.370> going<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.670> here

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
actually understand what's going on here

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.310 
actually understand what's going on here
and<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.209> were<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.360> some<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.750> wiki<00:03:28.020> info

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and there were you some like wiki info
