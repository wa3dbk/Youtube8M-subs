00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 girls hello everyone today's video I'm 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.639
 talk about my recent purchases 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.670
 this is mainly about buying a colorant company 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.620
 Meybellin oriflame and greenland 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.670
 Perhaps I'll start the most interesting thing 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.520
 I really liked it 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.140
 foundation from the ends of 5 self resistant 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.039
 foundation cream i'm mad 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 liked him very dense coverage 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.830
 he fits well and hides well 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.950
 drawbacks well covers everything 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.920
 We need to face that is all after the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 he will wear this foundation face cream 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 just perfect he lays down very well 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.260
 he did not roll down I put out 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.300
 all day long it is well worn 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 amazing that this is better 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.129
 foundation that I bought and worth 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.160
 he is about 40 dollars in principle 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 10 I personally advise everyone 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 My next purchase is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 friable mineral powder from clarence 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.810
 This is how this powder looks will give me 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 they are rather strange packaging like this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 here it is unscrewed 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.390
 rises here is such a brush 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.119
 Going and so small and not very much 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.749
 saved on length and size 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.030
 this tassel is very dense here 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.459
 her hair is tight and that little 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 harsh I would like to powder 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.679
 something softer and here it is 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.679
 The property itself is applied powder 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.500
 good, good at all day 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.469
 In fact, the packaging is not the most convenient and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.140
 I do not know why they came up with such 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.539
 tassel in the middle 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.239
 looks nice but she doesnâ€™t 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:02:00.450
 very convenient to use where pulling on 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:02.969
 cup from class this way a lotus length 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.609
 Nick is very beautiful pretty 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.509
 packaging such a brush in principle 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.319
 standard 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.439
 for mascara 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:17.590
 very comfortable she's actually a bit 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.810
 fat initially it needs to be used 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.569
 some time for the mascara to leave with 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.299
 brushes on a little bit became more dry 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.959
 how is she a little more liquid to me 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.480
 It seems after a week of using the amulet 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.139
 perfect for goddaughter 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.180
 their little scores the game gives a small 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:43.159
 this is blood the next is lipstick failure 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.099
 I really liked this lipstick 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.709
 she fits well on lips and she 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.489
 more translucent do not eat transparent 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.160
 there is a color on the lips and it does not dry the lips 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.960
 moisturize even under it well 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.980
 put no fingers on her 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.910
 fits well does not dry does not roll and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.970
 clubs are not obstinate there 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.660
 and klarans is all 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.620
 and following my purchase of this we had I 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.190
 bought two such lipsticks and again them 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.980
 the collection they are thin clinic 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.930
 The colors they have in the collection are very beautiful and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 they are all so gentle how nice not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.010
 I know how to say exactly girlish 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.380
 blonde what translucent I'm still 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.290
 I recently bought a long time ago 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.810
 means for strengthening eyelashes 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.030
 lashes in oriflame and I liked what 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.220
 she fixed her eyelashes very well 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.680
 I reached I went to pay at sea I did not want 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.730
 dyeing eyelashes I just wore this 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.830
 remedy and cilia were more 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.580
 fluffy they rose a little 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.070
 up and spread oles and it gave 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.560
 some volume and keep were not made up 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.800
 but I also used this tool for 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.440
 eyebrow she kept very well no 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.840
 no film no shine she 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.170
 gives she doesn't stick together she's great 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.569
 keeping an eyebrow jad well all day long 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.599
 there is absolutely not 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.130
 without a folder class oriflame tool such 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.169
 Here is blue in general this for eyelashes 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.229
 Fortifier but herbs for eyebrows, I think 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.380
 that it is great if they are 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.880
 there is nothing bad there and 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.000
 my last purchase which is very me 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.550
 liked this lip balm and i 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.110
 I was looking for lip balm for a very long time and I 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.099
 I can find the Kremlin called the ceiling 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.130
 look like fingers and i took myself dad i 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.139
 I'll give you some more strawberries and help 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.620
 something legs was shown palia strawberries 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.990
 they have a very pleasant smell but it is very 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.789
 heavily concentrated hit all abruptly 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.060
 breathing it seems to me unpleasant 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.320
 but when you put it on your lips 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.139
 calms down ie there is no such 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.020
 strong concentrate and he is very good 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.690
 your thread would put it under lipstick here 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.250
 this is my ticket because lipstick 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.599
 by the way was to say this lipstick is very 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.360
 very dry lips 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.389
 stunning color but not 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.130
 necessarily need a balm because 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.310
 If you apply this lipstick without balm, then 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.949
 in half an hour literally you are already stupid 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.050
 forever my lips are starting to pay 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.570
 it is so unpleasant and very 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.840
 pay heavily so I will definitely 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.820
 our balsam for her then ok she 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.419
 holding onto a balm to me 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.630
 it seems from him 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.740
 these are all my purchases lately 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.930
