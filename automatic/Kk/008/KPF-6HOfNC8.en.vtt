00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
up his right here i baked on the first

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
up his right here i baked on the first
turn<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.700> leading<00:00:35.969> fair<00:00:36.180> name

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.119 
turn because it's a leading fair name
what<00:00:36.540> else<00:00:36.660> could<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> just

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
what else could I do and then I just

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
what else could I do and then I just
kill<00:00:38.670> him<00:00:38.879> off<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:41.360> i'm<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.780> early

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
kill him off and i'm off to an early

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.709 
kill him off and i'm off to an early
lead<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.520> always<00:00:44.700> good

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
lead so that's always good

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.869 
lead so that's always good
he<00:00:47.719> sends<00:00:48.109> out<00:00:48.230> his<00:00:48.260> soul<00:00:48.980> rockies<00:00:49.609> using

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
he sends out his soul rockies using

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.740 
he sends out his soul rockies using
mostly<00:00:50.179> uu<00:00:51.140> pokes<00:00:51.440> eye<00:00:52.210> closed<00:00:53.210> climacus<00:00:53.600> is

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
mostly uu pokes eye closed climacus is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.479 
mostly uu pokes eye closed climacus is
really<00:00:54.109> nothing<00:00:54.379> else<00:00:54.649> I<00:00:54.800> can<00:00:54.859> do<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.460> know

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
really nothing else I can do and I know

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.000 
really nothing else I can do and I know
is<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.780> realize<00:00:57.109> at<00:00:57.229> this<00:00:57.320> point<00:00:57.620> he<00:00:57.769> was

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
is and I realize at this point he was

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.599 
is and I realize at this point he was
probably<00:00:58.579> using<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.940> trim<00:00:59.300> team<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.429> he<00:01:01.429> sits

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
probably using a trim team and he sits

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.889 
probably using a trim team and he sits
it<00:01:01.760> up<00:01:01.909> so<00:01:02.479> I<00:01:04.149> just<00:01:05.149> figure<00:01:05.360> because<00:01:05.539> I<00:01:05.600> don't

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
it up so I just figure because I don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.999 
it up so I just figure because I don't
want<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.110> waste<00:01:06.140> any<00:01:06.380> P<00:01:06.560> because<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.890> was

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
want to waste any P because I was

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.029 
want to waste any P because I was
thinking<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.610> could<00:01:07.640> def<00:01:08.149> fodder<00:01:08.830> infernape<00:01:09.830> or

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
thinking I could def fodder infernape or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.389 
thinking I could def fodder infernape or
use<00:01:10.399> him<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.320> stalls<00:01:12.320> for<00:01:12.530> triggerman<00:01:13.070> he

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
use him to stalls for triggerman he

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.940 
use him to stalls for triggerman he
bring<00:01:13.549> him<00:01:13.640> down<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.909> my<00:01:14.000> sash<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> was

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
bring him down to my sash so I was

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.350 
bring him down to my sash so I was
thinking<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.280> could<00:01:16.310> probably<00:01:16.789> get<00:01:17.149> away<00:01:17.180> to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
thinking I could probably get away to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.960 
thinking I could probably get away to
the<00:01:17.710> stealth<00:01:18.710> rock<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.310> then<00:01:19.399> switch<00:01:19.789> in

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
the stealth rock and then switch in

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.350 
the stealth rock and then switch in
Infernape<00:01:20.720> later<00:01:20.990> his<00:01:21.710> reflect<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.880> whereas

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
Infernape later his reflect the whereas

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.820 
Infernape later his reflect the whereas
I'm<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.509> don't<00:01:23.720> know<00:01:23.810> why<00:01:24.140> he<00:01:24.350> set<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.710> up

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
I'm I don't know why he set it up

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.050 
I'm I don't know why he set it up
