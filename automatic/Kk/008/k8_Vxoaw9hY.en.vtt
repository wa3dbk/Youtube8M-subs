you could get a newer camera and it
would<00:01:35.009> still<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> most<00:01:36.119> basic

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
would still have it be the most basic

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
would still have it be the most basic
entry-level<00:01:37.020> model<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> still<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.430> able<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

seeing right here in fact let me show
you<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.509> trick<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.380> with

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you a little trick that you can use with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
you a little trick that you can use with
any<00:01:43.799> camera<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.670> off<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> bat<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
any camera right off the bat see the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.139 
any camera right off the bat see the
little<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.470> says<00:01:46.680> shutter<00:01:47.579> speed<00:01:47.939> if

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
little thing that says shutter speed if

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
little thing that says shutter speed if
you<00:01:48.450> raise<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.990> number<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.770> longer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you raise that number to make it longer

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.160 
you raise that number to make it longer
whenever<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> take<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> picture<00:01:51.450> now<00:01:51.750> your

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
whenever you take a picture now your

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
whenever you take a picture now your
camera<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.549> several<00:01:53.850> seconds

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
camera will be on for several seconds

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.230 
camera will be on for several seconds
taking<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.399> amount<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.030> time

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
taking a picture for that amount of time

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940

now<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.079> cool<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
now this is really cool because what you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
now this is really cool because what you
can<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> light<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can do is take a light and then move it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
can do is take a light and then move it
around<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> frame<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.340> actually

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
around the frame and you can actually

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.359 
around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.600> trails<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> people

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
record like trails with that and people

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.889 
record like trails with that and people
if<00:02:05.729> you've<00:02:05.969> heard<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.420> technique<00:02:06.840> before

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
if you've heard of this technique before

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
if you've heard of this technique before
it's<00:02:07.320> called<00:02:07.530> light<00:02:07.740> painting<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.310> most

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it's called light painting but most

people<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.270> oh<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.430> wave

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
people think that oh I just I just wave

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.910 
people think that oh I just I just wave
a<00:02:11.459> flashlight<00:02:11.790> around<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.629> then

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
a flashlight around and then

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040 
a flashlight around and then
done<00:02:13.160> well<00:02:13.520> actually<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.300> whole<00:02:14.480> art<00:02:14.780> form

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
in and of itself because there are

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.479 
in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.690> different<00:02:18.260> types<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:19.010> lights<00:02:19.340> that
