00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
empty container some fabric and I chose

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.620 
empty container some fabric and I chose
to<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.050> two<00:00:22.230> different<00:00:22.260> types<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.010> fabrics

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
to get two different types of fabrics

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.790 
to get two different types of fabrics
you're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> take<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.199> container<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you're going to take your container and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200 
you're going to take your container and
measure<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.430> top<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
measure the top of it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.050 
measure the top of it
mine<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.349> 13<00:00:28.769> inches<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.970> either

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
mine was 13 inches so you can either

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
mine was 13 inches so you can either
double<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.900> triple<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> depending<00:00:32.130> on

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
double that or triple it depending on

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
double that or triple it depending on
how<00:00:32.430> full<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.360> skirt<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.840> and

how full you want your skirt to be and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
how full you want your skirt to be and
then<00:00:35.040> measure<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.550> long<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
then measure how long you need it to be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.220 
then measure how long you need it to be
and<00:00:36.809> cut<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> strip<00:00:38.809> then<00:00:39.809> you're<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and cut the strip then you're going to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.619 
and cut the strip then you're going to
start<00:00:40.500> by<00:00:40.710> taking<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.160> hot<00:00:41.340> glue<00:00:41.570> putting<00:00:42.570> a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.750 

at<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.580> end<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.290> folded<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.250> last<00:01:26.490> people

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
I cut the extra excess fabric and then I

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.390 
I cut the extra excess fabric and then I
folded<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.870> in<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> wouldn't<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> raw

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
folded it in so you wouldn't see the raw

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.010 
folded it in so you wouldn't see the raw
edge<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.520> small<00:01:38.790> benches<00:01:39.510> or<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.870> can

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
edge you can do small benches or you can

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.530 
edge you can do small benches or you can
do<00:01:40.170> large<00:01:40.440> ones<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.010> smaller<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.910> do<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
do large ones the smaller you do the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
do large ones the smaller you do the
more<00:01:42.810> full<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.260> skirt<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.740> look<00:01:46.070> okay<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
more full the skirt will look okay so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
more full the skirt will look okay so
now<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.910> end<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.510> where<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
now I'm at the end and this is where I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:59.590 
now I'm at the end and this is where I
cut<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.230> excess<00:01:49.650> off<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.950> folded<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.540 

and<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.750> didn't<00:02:01.050> have<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> sew<00:02:01.530> anything<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
and I didn't have to sew anything just

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:21.600 
and I didn't have to sew anything just
use<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.330> hot<00:02:03.510> glue

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.550 

okay<00:02:22.240> once<00:02:22.630> you're<00:02:22.810> done<00:02:22.960> with<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> skirt<00:02:23.530> you
