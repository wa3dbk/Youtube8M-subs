a<00:00:00.060> plane<00:00:00.510> without<00:00:00.870> windows<00:00:01.260> with<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.220> whole

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
a plane without windows with this whole

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.809 
a plane without windows with this whole
Belleza<00:00:02.639> air<00:00:02.850> crisis<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.890> you<00:00:04.890> know<00:00:05.009> we

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
Belleza air crisis going on you know we

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.570 
Belleza air crisis going on you know we
have<00:00:05.940> made<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.180> whole<00:00:06.359> conversation<00:00:06.600> about

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
have made this whole conversation about

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.620 
have made this whole conversation about
airlines<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.880> airline<00:00:09.179> industry<00:00:09.330> we

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
airlines and the airline industry we

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.790 
airlines and the airline industry we
thought<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.900> story<00:00:10.170> would<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.349> very<00:00:10.620> very

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
thought this story would be a very very

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.999 
thought this story would be a very very
very<00:00:10.920> useful<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.080> when<00:00:13.230> 2003

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
very useful one so as you know when 2003

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.550 
very useful one so as you know when 2003
they<00:00:14.370> grounded<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.599> supersonic<00:00:16.230> plane<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
they grounded the supersonic plane the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.080 
they grounded the supersonic plane the
Concorde<00:00:17.039> which<00:00:17.160> allowed<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> get<00:00:17.820> from

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
Concorde which allowed you to get from

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.060 
Concorde which allowed you to get from
United<00:00:18.600> States<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> London<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
United States to it to London and what I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130 
United States to it to London and what I
think<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.460> three<00:00:21.060> hours<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.779> hours

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
think it was three hours or two hours

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.330 
think it was three hours or two hours
they<00:00:22.320> grounded<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.220> was

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
they grounded it because it was

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.790 
they grounded it because it was
dangerous<00:00:24.109> right<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:25.619> they're

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
dangerous right and so now they're

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700 
dangerous right and so now they're
coming<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.580> spike<00:00:27.710> Aerospace

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
coming out the spike Aerospace

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
coming out the spike Aerospace
Corporation<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:30.090> coming<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> new

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
Corporation is coming out with a new

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.160 
Corporation is coming out with a new
plane<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:32.430> gonna<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> Mach<00:00:33.030> 1.6<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.899> mach

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
plane was gonna be a Mach 1.6 to mach

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.799 
plane was gonna be a Mach 1.6 to mach
1.8<00:00:34.829> supersonic<00:00:35.460> jet<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.420> start

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
1.8 supersonic jet that will start

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.040 
1.8 supersonic jet that will start
although<00:00:37.170> coming<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.770> will<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> air<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
although coming it will be in the air in

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.950 
although coming it will be in the air in
2018<00:00:40.399> now<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.120> allow<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.660> from

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
2018 now this will allow you to get from

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
2018 now this will allow you to get from
London<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> New<00:00:43.980> York<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.910> under<00:00:45.270> four

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
London to New York and just under four

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.220 
London to New York and just under four
hours<00:00:46.309> now<00:00:47.600> in<00:00:48.600> order<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> plane

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
hours now in order to make a plane

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
hours now in order to make a plane
lighter<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:51.030> what

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
lighter what the what the point what

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.040 
lighter what the what the point what
they've<00:00:51.329> basically<00:00:51.539> done<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
they've basically done here what the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.580 
they've basically done here what the
manufactures<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> plane<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> they've

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
manufactures the plane is that they've

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
manufactures the plane is that they've
got<00:00:55.800> they've<00:00:56.100> gotten<00:00:56.489> rid<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> windows

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
got they've gotten rid of windows

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.689 
got they've gotten rid of windows
because<00:00:58.530> windows<00:00:58.829> make<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> plane<00:00:59.340> heavier

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
because windows make the plane heavier

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.270 
because windows make the plane heavier
and<00:01:00.030> thus<00:01:00.600> slower<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> air<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.160> they've

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and thus slower in the air so they've

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
and thus slower in the air so they've
basically<00:01:02.520> limited<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> windows<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
basically limited all the windows on the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
basically limited all the windows on the
aircraft<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> instead<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> windows<00:01:05.129> which

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
aircraft and instead of windows which

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
aircraft and instead of windows which
you<00:01:05.369> sort<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.790> our<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.090> LCD<00:01:07.049> monitors

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you sort of have our like LCD monitors

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260 
you sort of have our like LCD monitors
that<00:01:07.710> surround<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> entire<00:01:08.369> plane<00:01:08.909> right

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that surround the entire plane right

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.820 
that surround the entire plane right
sort<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.720> something<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
sort of something like this like a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.480 
sort of something like this like a
helmet<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> LCD<00:01:12.659> monitors<00:01:13.229> either<00:01:14.159> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
helmet and the LCD monitors either can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.850 
helmet and the LCD monitors either can
show<00:01:14.729> cameras<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.020> happen<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> cameras

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
show cameras that are happen to cameras

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
show cameras that are happen to cameras
outside<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> aircraft<00:01:18.229> right<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.380> it's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
outside the aircraft right so it's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.160 
outside the aircraft right so it's
actually<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.250> watching

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
actually like you know you're watching

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
actually like you know you're watching
your<00:01:22.170> what's<00:01:22.409> happening<00:01:22.740> outside<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:24.090> can

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
your what's happening outside or it can

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
your what's happening outside or it can
show<00:01:24.450> presentations<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.619> movies<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.549> whatever

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
show presentations or movies or whatever

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
show presentations or movies or whatever
you<00:01:27.150> sort<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.960> jet<00:01:28.170> now

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you sort of want to do on this jet now

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.929 
you sort of want to do on this jet now
this<00:01:28.500> jet<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:28.979> small<00:01:29.250> jet<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> only<00:01:29.759> can

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this jet is a very small jet it only can

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
this jet is a very small jet it only can
accommodate<00:01:30.329> 12<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> 18<00:01:30.869> people<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.290> what

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
accommodate 12 to 18 people this what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
accommodate 12 to 18 people this what
they<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.310> supersonic<00:01:32.970> jet<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.450> what

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
they call this supersonic jet is what

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300 
they call this supersonic jet is what
they're<00:01:33.810> called<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> supersonic<00:01:34.770> aircraft

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they're called the supersonic aircraft

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.550 
they're called the supersonic aircraft
right<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.960> yet<00:01:37.110> still<00:01:37.560> yet<00:01:38.369> still<00:01:38.700> America

and the world for that matter like what

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
and the world for that matter like what
would<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.360> well<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:42.990> happen<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
would have well what would happen if the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
would have well what would happen if the
LED<00:01:44.189> monitor<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.670> LCD<00:01:45.000> monitors<00:01:45.360> were<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
LED monitor at LCD monitors were to go
