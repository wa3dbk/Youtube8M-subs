the<00:00:11.070> game<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.460> lot<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:11.849> I've<00:00:11.969> just<00:00:12.000> started<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the game a lot so I've just started a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.940 
the game a lot so I've just started a
dedicated<00:00:12.750> channel<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.230> only<00:00:13.590> very<00:00:13.769> recently

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
dedicated channel I only very recently

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.689 
dedicated channel I only very recently
got<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> full<00:00:14.670> game<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.800> because<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.980> had<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
got the full game and because I had a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
got the full game and because I had a
torrent<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.210> version<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> game<00:00:18.930> which<00:00:19.140> was

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
torrent at version of the game which was

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.189 
torrent at version of the game which was
I<00:00:19.619> think<00:00:20.250> version<00:00:20.760> 1.6<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.960> 1.7<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.199> played

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
I think version 1.6 or 1.7 so I played

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
I think version 1.6 or 1.7 so I played
that<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> while<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.550> feel<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.880> they

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that for a while and I feel like they

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
that for a while and I feel like they
deserve<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> money<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.380> bought

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
bike setup because I don't know what to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.100 
bike setup because I don't know what to
do<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.739> video<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> go

and<00:00:37.309> stability<00:00:38.309> 0<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.149> did<00:00:39.719> anything<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.800> 10

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and stability 0 I did anything from 10

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
and stability 0 I did anything from 10
down<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> 0<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> basically<00:00:42.180> keep<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.629> with

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
down to 0 you can basically keep up with

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160 
down to 0 you can basically keep up with
the<00:00:42.809> faster<00:00:43.140> kids<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.210> but<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.390> find<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.870> zero

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the faster kids and but I find a zero

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.740 
the faster kids and but I find a zero
what's<00:00:46.379> best<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> allows<00:00:47.370> me<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.750> get

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
what's best for me it allows me to get

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.310 
what's best for me it allows me to get
some<00:00:48.960> fat<00:00:49.260> wipes<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> go

analog stick pauses P and that's about
everything<00:03:50.290> it's<00:03:50.650> kind<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.670> I

everything it's kind of like a the I
guess<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.530> little<00:03:53.769> bit<00:03:53.890> like<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.280> MX<00:03:55.200> vs.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200
