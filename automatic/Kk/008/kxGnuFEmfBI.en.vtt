access to drop the pull right in you can
reverse<00:00:36.100> reverse<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.510> it's<00:00:37.660> in<00:00:37.750> that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
reverse reverse it so that it's in that

position for baiting and tying rigs and
then<00:00:42.879> have<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.449> out<00:00:43.629> front<00:00:43.960> this<00:00:44.379> way<00:00:44.559> when

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
then have it out front this way when

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.080 
then have it out front this way when
you're<00:00:45.670> um<00:00:46.030> naturally<00:00:46.960> fishing<00:00:47.320> but<00:00:48.100> this

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
you're um naturally fishing but this

you're um naturally fishing but this
does<00:00:49.270> not<00:00:49.390> fit<00:00:49.809> many<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.170> my<00:00:50.440> saltwater<00:00:50.800> rods

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
does not fit many of my saltwater rods

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.889 
does not fit many of my saltwater rods
and<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.760> strap<00:00:52.030> here<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.420> kind<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.570> okay

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
and the strap here is kind of it's okay

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.240 
and the strap here is kind of it's okay
but<00:00:56.110> it's<00:00:56.230> not<00:00:56.289> as<00:00:56.500> nice<00:00:56.649> as<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.950> other<00:00:57.100> one

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
but it's not as nice as the other one

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.139 
but it's not as nice as the other one
it's<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.399> little<00:00:57.489> hard<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:57.789> get<00:00:57.910> locked

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
it's a little hard to get locked

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.639 
it's a little hard to get locked
especially<00:00:58.719> if<00:00:58.870> you're<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.260> our<00:00:59.350> rougher

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
especially if you're in our rougher

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.079 
especially if you're in our rougher
water<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.670> I'm<00:01:01.030> not<00:01:01.480> my<00:01:01.690> my<00:01:02.590> favorite<00:01:03.129> mount<00:01:03.820> I

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
water so I'm not my my favorite mount I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.900 
water so I'm not my my favorite mount I
do<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.259> this<00:01:05.410> one<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.130> older<00:01:06.490> one<00:01:06.670> that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
do like this one and the older one that

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.400 
do like this one and the older one that
Scotty<00:01:07.210> had<00:01:07.420> put<00:01:07.630> out<00:01:07.750> which<00:01:07.960> was<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.289> one

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
Scotty had put out which was this one

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.410 
Scotty had put out which was this one
right<00:01:08.560> here<00:01:08.830> still<00:01:09.460> works<00:01:09.729> well<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.149> then<00:01:10.360> I

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
right here still works well and then I

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.230 
right here still works well and then I
just<00:01:10.600> use<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:11.039> bungee<00:01:12.039> cord<00:01:12.190> as<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.729> leash<00:01:13.090> around

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
just use a bungee cord as a leash around

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.210 
just use a bungee cord as a leash around
the<00:01:13.690> reel<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.500> hold<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.800> place

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
the reel just to hold it in place

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.969 
the reel just to hold it in place
and<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:16.780> finding<00:01:17.050> that<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.320> like<00:01:17.530> those<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> lot

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
and I'm finding that I like those a lot

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.430 
and I'm finding that I like those a lot
better<00:01:18.220> than<00:01:18.310> these<00:01:18.520> flush<00:01:18.850> mounts<00:01:19.440> problem

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
better than these flush mounts problem

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.169 
better than these flush mounts problem
with<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.590> flush<00:01:20.770> mount<00:01:21.039> for<00:01:21.789> example<00:01:22.090> with

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
with the flush mount for example with

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.999 
with the flush mount for example with
this<00:01:22.240> equipment<00:01:23.429> bar<00:01:24.429> on<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.819> is<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:26.009> you've

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
this equipment bar on it is that you've

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.690 
this equipment bar on it is that you've
taken<00:01:27.220> some<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.640> fabric<00:01:27.970> out<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:29.700> they're

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
taken some of the fabric out so they're

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.949 
taken some of the fabric out so they're
they're<00:01:31.000> not<00:01:31.030> as<00:01:31.330> rigid<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.649> course<00:01:33.039> as<00:01:33.250> as

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
they're not as rigid of course as as

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.499 
they're not as rigid of course as as
these<00:01:34.959> are<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.310> other<00:01:36.789> thing<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.149> when

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
these are the other thing is that when

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.760 
these are the other thing is that when
they're<00:01:37.630> not<00:01:37.720> in<00:01:37.780> use<00:01:37.929> they<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.530> tendency

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
they're not in use they have a tendency

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.139 
they're not in use they have a tendency
to<00:01:38.920> fill<00:01:39.190> up<00:01:39.250> with<00:01:39.280> water<00:01:39.399> even<00:01:39.700> if<00:01:39.970> you've<00:01:40.060> got

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
to fill up with water even if you've got

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.660 
to fill up with water even if you've got
the<00:01:40.240> plugs<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:40.660> place<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.280> tendency

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the plugs in place they have a tendency

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.940 
the plugs in place they have a tendency
to<00:01:42.700> fill<00:01:42.940> up<00:01:43.119> kind<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:43.959> pain<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.619> other<00:01:44.649> thing

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
to fill up kind of pain the other thing

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.540 
to fill up kind of pain the other thing
is<00:01:45.069> you<00:01:45.160> can't<00:01:45.399> switch<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.789> position<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
is you can't switch the position on the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.900 
is you can't switch the position on the
rods<00:01:49.110> obviously<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.349> turn<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.910> 360

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
rods obviously you can turn this 360

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.710 
rods obviously you can turn this 360
degrees<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:55.360> know<00:01:55.479> when<00:01:55.630> you're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
degrees and you know when you're

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.880 
degrees and you know when you're
underway<00:01:55.989> if<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.229> want<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.770> that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
underway if you want to have it in that

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.830 
underway if you want to have it in that
position<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:57.789> it's<00:01:57.940> out<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.209> way<00:01:58.360> but<00:01:58.660> when

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
position so it's out of the way but when

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.150 
position so it's out of the way but when
you're<00:01:58.989> you<00:01:59.289> stopping<00:01:59.679> your<00:01:59.800> fishing<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.099> can

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
you're you stopping your fishing you can

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.070 
you're you stopping your fishing you can
bring<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.459> out<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.729> right<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:01.660> course<00:02:01.959> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
bring it out to the right of course the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.570 
bring it out to the right of course the
positioning<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:02.709> these<00:02:02.920> fixed<00:02:03.190> mounts<00:02:03.489> is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
positioning on these fixed mounts is

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.040 
positioning on these fixed mounts is
great<00:02:03.849> for<00:02:04.090> when<00:02:04.270> you're<00:02:04.360> under<00:02:04.630> way<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.899> just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
great for when you're under way and just

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.139 
great for when you're under way and just
transporting<00:02:05.679> them<00:02:05.830> but<00:02:06.429> not<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.880> great

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
transporting them but not that great

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.370 
transporting them but not that great
when<00:02:07.360> you're<00:02:07.479> fishing<00:02:07.840> unless<00:02:08.200> you're

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
when you're fishing unless you're

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.460 
when you're fishing unless you're
sitting<00:02:08.590> sideways<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.369> boat<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.599> that's

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
sitting sideways on the boat so that's

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.260 
sitting sideways on the boat so that's
my<00:02:11.709> take<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.569> boat<00:02:13.720> rod<00:02:13.930> holders

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
my take on the on the boat rod holders

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.900
