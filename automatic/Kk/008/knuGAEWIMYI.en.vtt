 Dear Belgians, we are on the bench in this competition 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.840
 in germany the netherlands logically to all three of the whole world 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.770
 the netherlands controls the first half of the game 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.760
 and now a next action is from michiel gerritsen

 9 4 is it then 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.999
 the globe in a last year did cause a surprise by in the 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.159
 home game with a sizzler 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.159
 to beat the world champion 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.089
 but the question 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:28.939
 11 four for the netherlands flat at rest would lead with 12 against 5 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.420
 that's the match 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.840
 for the second part 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.519
 become a formality 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 Leon Simons tries it again from a distance 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.529
 that all happens in the knowledge that tomorrow will be the second game 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.769
 wait with a fanatic audience 81 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.389
 the belgian team 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.909
 the first match 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.509
 take it seriously 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.509
 still traces via and thinking level 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.749
 but not all cards so put on a departure 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.859
 in antwerp tomorrow 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.939
 the dutch national coach jan sjouke van den bos also brings 2 in the second half 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.939
 0 invaders in the team like this site 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.719
 the sixteenth 7 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.149
 the netherlands would also win the competition 9 8 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.999
 the national coach has his doubts about what he has won, and so does 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.809
 not always directly with the strongest line-up in the first game 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.450
 the other finds this a value 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.099
 Significantly fewer of these plan a two summit meetings of which you are the one 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.489
 bit degrades because they see it from my point of view 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.220
 just want a time from ours and everything is focused on the arena tomorrow stand for 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.980
 rowdy a complete madhouse the players on the couch today have quite 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.330
 have looked carefully what we have done what bad those are complete tomorrow and they are going 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.019
 before and why I had to repair the problems with ours 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.559
 base of players 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:56.009
 win a demonstrable mother 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.990
 where are we going worldwide tomorrow limited 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.280
 by this way of dealing with this they push over competitions
