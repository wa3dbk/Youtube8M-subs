what's neat is that the car is being

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
what's neat is that the car is being
very<00:00:46.200> cautious<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.800> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> good<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
very cautious here which is good it is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
very cautious here which is good it is
moving<00:00:48.930> around<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.500> boundaries<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
moving around these boundaries here and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510 
moving around these boundaries here and
taking<00:00:51.899> us<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.530> slow<00:00:52.829> drive<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.250> sure

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
taking us on a very slow drive I'm sure

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
taking us on a very slow drive I'm sure
they<00:00:53.699> don't<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.180> faster<00:00:54.690> than<00:00:54.840> two

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they don't want to go faster than two

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.540 
they don't want to go faster than two
miles<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.500> hour<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> speed<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.430> are

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
miles an hour which is the speed we are

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
miles an hour which is the speed we are
going<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.680> correcting

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
going at right now but it is correcting

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.369 
going at right now but it is correcting
itself<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> driving<00:00:59.760> us<00:00:59.879> around<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
itself and driving us around here as you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.039 
itself and driving us around here as you
can<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:02.090> really<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.719> bad<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
can see it's really pretty not bad of a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
can see it's really pretty not bad of a
driver<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.920> parking<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
driver in a parking lot here now this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
driver in a parking lot here now this
pedestrians<00:01:06.210> crossing<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> slowing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pedestrians crossing and it is slowing

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
pedestrians crossing and it is slowing
down<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.540> pedestrian<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.680> have

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
down for that pedestrian and we have

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
down for that pedestrian and we have
come<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> stop<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
come to a stop and I think that is the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
come to a stop and I think that is the
extent<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:12.990> ride<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:13.560> cool<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
extent of our ride but pretty cool that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
extent of our ride but pretty cool that
we<00:01:14.610> didn't<00:01:14.760> hurt<00:01:14.880> anybody<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.799> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we didn't hurt anybody and we're in an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
we didn't hurt anybody and we're in an
autonomous<00:01:17.250> car<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.210> survived<00:01:18.509> our<00:01:18.720> trip

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
autonomous car so we survived our trip

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
autonomous car so we survived our trip
in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> BMW<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.250> driving<00:01:20.670> by<00:01:20.850> itself<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
in the BMW that was driving by itself it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
in the BMW that was driving by itself it
was<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:21.720> cool<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
front when this woman walked in front of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
front when this woman walked in front of
the<00:01:30.240> car<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> actually<00:01:30.840> slowed<00:01:31.229> down<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the car it actually slowed down a little

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
the car it actually slowed down a little
bit<00:01:31.950> faster<00:01:32.340> than<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> may<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.790> otherwise<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
bit faster than it may have otherwise so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
bit faster than it may have otherwise so
it<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.770> sensing<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it really is out there sensing and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.530 
it really is out there sensing and
what's<00:01:35.460> interesting<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.240> technology

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
what's interesting about this technology

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200 
what's interesting about this technology
is<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.100> drive<00:01:38.369> faster<00:01:39.030> than

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
is that it can really drive faster than

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
is that it can really drive faster than
two<00:01:39.390> miles<00:01:39.630> per<00:01:39.780> hour<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> course<00:01:41.280> there

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
two miles per hour but of course there

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
two miles per hour but of course there
are<00:01:41.490> safety<00:01:41.640> considerations<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
are safety considerations and it's a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.399 
are safety considerations and it's a
combination<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.390> technology<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.540> regulation

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
combination of technology and regulation

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
combination of technology and regulation
really<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.040> governments<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> be

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
really because governments have to be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
really because governments have to be
comfortable<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.360> these<00:01:48.479> cars<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.960> drive

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
comfortable if these cars can drive

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
comfortable if these cars can drive
themselves<00:01:49.890> safely<00:01:50.790> enough<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.329> allow<00:01:51.630> people

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
themselves safely enough to allow people

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.249 
themselves safely enough to allow people
to<00:01:52.049> use<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> roads<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> same

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to use them on the roads and at the same

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.399 
to use them on the roads and at the same
time<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:56.640> technology<00:01:57.390> needs<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.930> perfect

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
time the technology needs to be perfect

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.870 
time the technology needs to be perfect
or<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.619> least<00:01:58.740> close<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.979> perfect<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.610> order<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
or at least close to perfect in order to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490 
or at least close to perfect in order to
get<00:02:00.060> us<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> time

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
get us there so I think for the time

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.569 
get us there so I think for the time
being<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.369> these

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
being we're going to see these

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.670 
being we're going to see these
technologies<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.750> creep<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.229> our

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
technologies kind of creep into our

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.770 
technologies kind of creep into our
daily<00:02:05.219> driving<00:02:05.820> experiences<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
daily driving experiences you know the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.619 
daily driving experiences you know the
Lane<00:02:07.259> avoidance<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.610> technologies<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
Lane avoidance you know technologies and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.820 
Lane avoidance you know technologies and
things<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.929> prevent<00:02:10.170> accidents<00:02:10.619> we'll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
things that prevent accidents we'll

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
things that prevent accidents we'll
probably<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:11.819> development<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
probably see more development on that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.089 
probably see more development on that
side

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
side

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.739 
side
and<00:02:13.189> eventually<00:02:13.640> we'll<00:02:13.999> start<00:02:14.269> seeing<00:02:14.540> cars

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
and eventually we'll start seeing cars

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.449 
and eventually we'll start seeing cars
do<00:02:14.959> more<00:02:15.200> things<00:02:15.409> like<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:15.859> saw<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.400> you

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
do more things like we saw here so you

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.649 
do more things like we saw here so you
know<00:02:16.519> summoning<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:16.999> car<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.359> watch

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
know summoning the car with a watch

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.539 
know summoning the car with a watch
having<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.409> pick<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.709> up<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.099> then<00:02:19.310> maybe

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
having it pick you up and then maybe

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.099 
having it pick you up and then maybe
having<00:02:19.909> it<00:02:20.060> drive<00:02:20.329> you<00:02:20.480> somewhere<00:02:20.540> at<00:02:20.959> some

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
having it drive you somewhere at some

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.629 
having it drive you somewhere at some
point<00:02:21.349> in<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:21.560> future<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.069> pretty<00:02:22.249> exciting

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639 
point in the future so pretty exciting

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.280 
point in the future so pretty exciting
stuff<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.030> had<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.629> good<00:02:23.749> time<00:02:23.810> over<00:02:24.019> here<00:02:24.230> at

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
stuff and had a good time over here at

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.100 
stuff and had a good time over here at
the<00:02:24.379> BMW<00:02:24.590> experience

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170
