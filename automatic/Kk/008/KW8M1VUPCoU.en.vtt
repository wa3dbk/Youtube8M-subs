00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.820 

well<00:03:31.569> they<00:03:31.780> tired<00:03:32.049> pretty<00:03:32.319> much<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.650> me

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
nephews papers on my foot but didn't

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.020 
nephews papers on my foot but didn't
count<00:03:36.989> home<00:03:38.040> yeah<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.760> was<00:03:39.849> pretty

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
count home yeah I think it was pretty

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.080 
count home yeah I think it was pretty
much<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.329> tie<00:03:40.629> maybe<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.409> think<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.280> Eureka

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
much a tie maybe I think this Eureka

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.119 
much a tie maybe I think this Eureka
might<00:03:43.269> have<00:03:43.420> been<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.019> little<00:03:44.140> bit<00:03:44.290> faster<00:03:44.920> but

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
might have been a little bit faster but

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.530 
might have been a little bit faster but
I<00:03:45.430> think<00:03:46.120> that's<00:03:46.269> pretty<00:03:46.510> much<00:03:46.659> time<00:03:47.200> so

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I think that's pretty much time so

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.809 
I think that's pretty much time so
