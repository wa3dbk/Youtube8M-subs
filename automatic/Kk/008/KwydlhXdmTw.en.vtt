00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.610 

and<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.720> one<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> don't<00:02:48.050> know<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.320> can<00:02:48.470> see

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
and this one I don't know if you can see

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.340 
and this one I don't know if you can see
it<00:02:48.740> but<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.100> definitely<00:02:49.630> says<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.750> very<00:02:50.960> clear

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
it but it definitely says it very clear

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.920 
it but it definitely says it very clear
on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.250> bottom<00:02:54.550> now<00:02:55.550> as<00:02:55.670> far<00:02:55.820> as<00:02:55.880> 8<00:02:56.180> bit<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.600> 10

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
on the bottom now as far as 8 bit and 10

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.780 
on the bottom now as far as 8 bit and 10
bit<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.440> don't<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.340> whole<00:02:58.520> lot<00:02:58.550> of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
bit I don't have a whole lot of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.550 
bit I don't have a whole lot of
information<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.540> but<00:02:59.600> I<00:03:00.050> did<00:03:00.200> find<00:03:00.440> this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
information on this but I did find this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.640 
information on this but I did find this
color<00:03:00.860> scale<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.520> grayscale<00:03:02.210> rather<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
color scale a grayscale rather and I

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.380 
color scale a grayscale rather and I
don't<00:03:06.860> see<00:03:07.100> much<00:03:07.340> banning<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> seems<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.330> be

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
don't see much banning it seems to be

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.050 
don't see much banning it seems to be
pretty<00:03:08.600> small<00:03:08.840> banning<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.530> I'm<00:03:09.850> gonna<00:03:10.850> go

pretty small banning so I'm gonna go
with<00:03:11.270> its<00:03:12.020> 10<00:03:12.620> bit<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:19.100> as<00:03:19.610> far<00:03:19.880> as<00:03:23.770> input<00:03:24.770> lag

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
with its 10 bit and as far as input lag

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.400 
with its 10 bit and as far as input lag
I<00:03:25.370> don't<00:03:25.730> really<00:03:25.940> have<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:28.000> CRT<00:03:29.000> monitor<00:03:29.660> to
