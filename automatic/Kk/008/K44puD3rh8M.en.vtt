00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.440
 I am a club head of music here Let's enjoy it today 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.760
 Sound fellow parts about Na Ne there in it now buzz today is to do a song called Takaramonozu 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.490
 I want to 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:26.120
 Right now 24-24 May of 2014 What is not it? 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 It seems to be used at the opening of animation and game games under 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.110
 Had 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.420
 It was a school idol festival 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 I also look dissolved or recently started a little in what so much little that ignorant I'm sorry 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 I'm sorry 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.740
 There are why old lady about Nera subscription-chan out it is to say whether has become such a thing 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.380
 I was 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:49.700
 That I of this video is I put the key so that the price increases 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:55.360
 It 's a story that the brain can't cry through songs, so I'll be a teacher for a while 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:00.400
 Let's say it is a jersey that we want to live today because we have to 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.160
 First of all it is this song, but you use a kind of transformational code 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.420
 For example, Toka Minasanko f 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.960
 I think that f composition is under bass sheet but 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:18.830
 Hey we use a slightly modified version of this kind Valley code 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:22.010
 This is the origin of this word 1234567 8 frets 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.330
 I have been to the past but this valley code is coming 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.050
 Make this a 10 fret ring finger 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.750
 This 4 cases 32 cases all the same 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.780
 I feel I Tsu does not sound one string to hold the fret 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.780
 Nun 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 bouvet when it comes to an upstroke 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.590
 Also it's a not draw Ppe 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 I the index finger to say what to do um because I'm think To little that's it 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.500
 I'm inviting you to turn it into an index finger when holding this ring finger here 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.259
 Because 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 Ion source tree fret screw a fret between a 3 lodging frets between 10 frets 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.190
 But it I'll be clerk if rubbed on one side 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.750
 Such a feeling of dirt horse is processed with the middle finger 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 A lot of other poops, for example, if you're here for a long time 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.050
 Can be touched lightly 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.680
 The 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.680
 Like this 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.980
 Please come 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.580
 Boooo say this 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.980
 That's why 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.709
 In this first one th action 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.709
 But to the secondary whammy in the 4 # 3 of 2 reviews 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.420
 It is 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.000
 Next time it 's shaped like a cat's reflex, but this 8 fret makes this f-like shape 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.590
 I say I want you to get this too 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.100
 What is this a 4 of 2 only 2 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.940
 I want to use it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.700
 This kind of because I'm not want to run the sound is heavy at that time 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.160
 Say 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 In feeling that will not bring 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.569
 This word source is muted in the small place of the ring finger in the 6 yen nationally 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.310
 In fret in the 4 stars 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.170
 Become this ring finger a so 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:34.330
 Three 9th Fret Middle Fingers 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.720
 It does not sound the first string in the day equal to this 8 fret of 2 Well 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.720
 This is 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.210
 Boo Boo next code is 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.780
 Oh this 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:06.860
 This a of it is a a This is the 10 fret 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:12.940
 Even if you're not a major, you're missing a mid-level version. 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.940
 That's before this data can not be a little really but it is that dark feeling 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.710
 I use this code to feel like 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:27.470
 I'm heavy with a cat , but I 'll do it with this 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.430
 Again 3 hotels with the index finger to unplug the middle finger I I'm I want the sound of the fret of the index finger 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.550

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.800
 Entered was 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:56.840
 Te' I dog Zutte ana system 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.160
 right 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:08.690
 It's not made in the coming ne The following code is doing at the time of this code c of a little while ago not 432 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.170
 In this 3 b middle finger index finger is good 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.240
 If this is the 10th fret autumn fret 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.480

 Here to say that also returns in 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.910
 Here it this code will be referred to as E'b flat 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.930
 back to essie 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.930
 This is a person as well 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.900
 atata atata 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.169
 It is eh l to have 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.680
