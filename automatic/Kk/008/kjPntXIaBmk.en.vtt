people i'm saving saving saving and if

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800 
people i'm saving saving saving and if
you<00:01:04.650> notice<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> value<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> dollar<00:01:06.360> goes

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you notice as the value of a dollar goes

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.710 
you notice as the value of a dollar goes
down<00:01:07.290> prices<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.299> call<00:01:09.510> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
down prices go up so they call this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
down prices go up so they call this
inflation<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.720> look<00:01:12.840> at<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:15.979> 1997<00:01:17.119> oil

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
inflation now you look at in 1997 oil

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.219 
inflation now you look at in 1997 oil
was<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:19.860> ten<00:01:20.310> dollars<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> barrel

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
was about I think ten dollars a barrel

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
was about I think ten dollars a barrel
ten<00:01:22.229> years<00:01:22.259> later<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.220> about<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> hundred

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
ten years later it's about a hundred

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
ten years later it's about a hundred
thirty-five<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.640> barrel<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
thirty-five a barrel so this is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
thirty-five a barrel so this is
inflation<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> does<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
inflation but really what it is does the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
inflation but really what it is does the
dollar's<00:01:29.909> value<00:01:29.939> coming<00:01:30.720> down<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.320> savers<00:01:31.829> are

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
dollar's value coming down so savers are

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.179 
dollar's value coming down so savers are
getting<00:01:32.250> wiped<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.939> today<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.619> keep

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
getting wiped out today so just keep

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.460 
getting wiped out today so just keep
saying<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> yourself<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.570> kids<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.200> save

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
saying to yourself and here kids to save

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.819 
saying to yourself and here kids to save
money<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.960> new<00:01:40.140> rule<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:40.650> an

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
money then is not the new rule that's an

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.300 
money then is not the new rule that's an
old<00:01:41.040> goal<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.750> big<00:01:43.140> problem<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.920> most

I'm betting against the US dollar and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.690 
I'm betting against the US dollar and
that's<00:02:24.720> why<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.190> idea<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:26.610> going

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that's why this idea that you're going

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.399 
that's why this idea that you're going
to<00:02:26.760> tell<00:02:27.000> people<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> need<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.659> save<00:02:28.080> money

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
to tell people you need to save money

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.460 
to tell people you need to save money
that's<00:02:29.099> really<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.209> an<00:02:30.450> obsolete<00:02:30.900> idea

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that's really really an obsolete idea

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.759 
that's really really an obsolete idea
because<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.280> idea<00:02:32.400> when<00:02:32.879> obsolete<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.769> 1971

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
because the idea when obsolete in 1971

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.089 
because the idea when obsolete in 1971
the<00:02:35.459> US<00:02:35.849> dollar<00:02:36.299> in<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> last<00:02:36.959> few<00:02:37.290> years<00:02:37.349> has

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
the US dollar in the last few years has

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.220 
the US dollar in the last few years has
lost<00:02:38.459> almost<00:02:38.760> eighty<00:02:39.209> percent<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:40.049> its

lost almost eighty percent of its
purchasing<00:02:40.829> power<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.480> prediction<00:02:43.110> is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
purchasing power and the prediction is

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.360 
purchasing power and the prediction is
because<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.769> happened<00:02:44.220> throughout

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
because this has happened throughout

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.280 
because this has happened throughout
history<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.239> happened<00:02:45.659> thousands<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> years

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the old rules of money I just want to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.360 
the old rules of money I just want to
get<00:03:12.720> wiped<00:03:12.989> out<00:03:13.200> because<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.829> purchasing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
get wiped out because the purchasing

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.400 
get wiped out because the purchasing
power<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.879> their<00:03:15.150> dollars<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.019> go<00:03:16.140> down

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
power of their dollars going to go down

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.460 
power of their dollars going to go down
so<00:03:17.069> even<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.579> bank<00:03:17.879> paying<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.540> five<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.260> ten

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
so even for bank paying you five to ten

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.099 
so even for bank paying you five to ten
percent<00:03:19.919> interest<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:21.060> can't<00:03:21.359> keep<00:03:21.630> up<00:03:21.900> with

the bank's printing money so that's the

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.440 
the bank's printing money so that's the
