00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.330 

take<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> bow<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.929> really<00:00:10.500> fun<00:00:10.740> behavior<00:00:11.219> to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
take a bow is a really fun behavior to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.610 
take a bow is a really fun behavior to
train<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.360> there's<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> variety<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.110> ways<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
train and there's a variety of ways of

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.460 
train and there's a variety of ways of
doing<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.730> could<00:00:15.059> capture<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.960> what

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
doing it we could capture about what

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.140 
doing it we could capture about what
about<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.949> essentially<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:18.000> dog

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
about is essentially is when your dog

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540 
about is essentially is when your dog
gets<00:00:18.180> up<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> takes<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.439> beautiful<00:00:20.130> stretch

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
gets up and takes a beautiful stretch

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
gets up and takes a beautiful stretch
pulling<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> front<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> their<00:00:21.660> body<00:00:21.810> down<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
pulling the front of their body down to

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
pulling the front of their body down to
the<00:00:22.439> ground<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.070> stretching<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> rear<00:00:24.330> up

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the ground and stretching the rear up

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.720 
the ground and stretching the rear up
into<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> air<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> natural<00:00:26.369> behavior

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
into the air so it's a natural behavior

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.509 
into the air so it's a natural behavior
that<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:27.359> dogs<00:00:27.900> generally<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:29.279> more

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that all dogs generally do some more

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.790 
that all dogs generally do some more
than<00:00:29.670> others<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.689> might<00:00:30.900> also<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
than others we might also see this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.459 
than others we might also see this
behavior<00:00:32.009> naturally<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.059> dogs<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.440> are

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
behavior naturally in dogs when they are

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
behavior naturally in dogs when they are
playing<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.040> each<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.730> often<00:00:36.030> call<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
playing with each other we often call it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
playing with each other we often call it
a<00:00:36.420> play<00:00:36.660> bow<00:00:36.930> where<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.559> dog<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:38.129> bow<00:00:38.340> down

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
a play bow where one dog will bow down

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
a play bow where one dog will bow down
to<00:00:38.879> another<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.719> encourage<00:00:39.899> them<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.469> play

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to another one to encourage them to play

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
to another one to encourage them to play
so<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> techniques<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.320> for

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so one of the techniques we can use for

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680 
so one of the techniques we can use for
training<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.550> called<00:00:44.789> capturing<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
training this is called capturing the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.080 
training this is called capturing the
dog<00:00:45.870> simply<00:00:46.260> does<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> naturally<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.460> we

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
dog simply does it naturally and we

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
dog simply does it naturally and we
click<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.719> mark<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> verbal<00:00:49.920> marker

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
click or mark it with a verbal marker

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.700 
click or mark it with a verbal marker
and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.300> reward<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.289> course<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.620> have

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and then we reward it of course we have

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
and then we reward it of course we have
to<00:00:52.800> wait<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> happen<00:00:53.660> another<00:00:54.660> way

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to wait for it to happen another way

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
to wait for it to happen another way
that<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.590> train<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.070> behavior<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.910> by

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that we can train this behavior is by

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
that we can train this behavior is by
luring<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:58.079> dog's<00:00:58.320> head<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.949> while<00:00:59.550> keeping

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
luring our dog's head down while keeping

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
luring our dog's head down while keeping
their<00:01:00.090> rear<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> air<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.590> third<00:01:01.890> way

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
their rear in the air and the third way

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
their rear in the air and the third way
which<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.670> favorite<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.449> going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
which is my favorite and what I'm going

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.830 
which is my favorite and what I'm going
to<00:01:03.629> demonstrate<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.890> shaping

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
to demonstrate for you is shaping

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.179 
to demonstrate for you is shaping
shaping<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> break<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> behavior

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
shaping is where you break a behavior

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.789 
shaping is where you break a behavior
down<00:01:08.400> into<00:01:08.820> small<00:01:09.150> achievable<00:01:09.299> steps<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
down into small achievable steps and you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
down into small achievable steps and you
slowly<00:01:11.280> communicate<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.450> dog<00:01:12.659> along

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
slowly communicate with your dog along

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.160 
slowly communicate with your dog along
the<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:15.299> looking<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.930> as

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the way as to what you're looking for as

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
the way as to what you're looking for as
the<00:01:16.229> end<00:01:16.560> result<00:01:16.799> again<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the end result again you want to be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
the end result again you want to be
organized<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> end

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
organized you want to know what the end

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
organized you want to know what the end
result<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.299> any

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
result is but you want to see any

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.899 
result is but you want to see any
movement<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.590> dog<00:01:22.799> makes<00:01:23.220> that's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
movement that your dog makes that's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
movement that your dog makes that's
that's<00:01:24.540> moving<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> direction<00:01:25.170> slowly

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that's moving in that direction slowly

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
that's moving in that direction slowly
so<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.689> bow

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
so for bow

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.240 
so for bow
I<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.740> first<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.880> let<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.390> dog<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:31.250> by

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I would first want to let my dog know by

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
I would first want to let my dog know by
using<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.790> clicker<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> marker<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> want

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
using my clicker as a marker that I want

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
using my clicker as a marker that I want
them<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> standing<00:01:35.549> position<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> might

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
them in a standing position so I might

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
them in a standing position so I might
click<00:01:37.259> standing<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.159> few<00:01:38.189> times

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.100 

I'm<00:01:42.820> going<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.030> wait<00:01:43.150> for<00:01:43.330> him<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.510> stand<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.990> can

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
I'm going to wait for him to stand I can

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm going to wait for him to stand I can
encourage<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.650> by<00:01:44.770> moving<00:01:44.950> back<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.310> little<00:01:45.610> bit

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
encourage it by moving back a little bit

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.930 
encourage it by moving back a little bit
and<00:01:46.650> then<00:01:47.650> he<00:01:47.740> did<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.280> me<00:01:48.460> I'm<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
and then he did it for me I'm going to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.760 
and then he did it for me I'm going to
look<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.240> see<00:01:49.270> if<00:01:49.450> he<00:01:49.660> drops<00:01:49.900> his<00:01:50.110> head<00:01:50.320> down<00:01:50.530> at

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
look to see if he drops his head down at

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.910 
look to see if he drops his head down at
all<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:52.150> help<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.560> there<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:53.890> goes

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
all to help with that and there it goes
