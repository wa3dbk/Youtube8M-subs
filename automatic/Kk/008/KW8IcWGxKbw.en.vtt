00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 in December 2010, the maximum radio will turn 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.800
 19 years during this time 10 times changed 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.470
 software director ao several times 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.070
 changed in the morning show 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.890
 New DJs came and went but 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.590
 throughout this time on air 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.990
 the radio station was a constant 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 man whose voice waves 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 maximum esters give the skin 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 18 years, any listener I will tell you the maximum 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.689
 what is it about alexander no need 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.720
 which became a kind of symbol 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 radio stations years 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.380
 m 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 baby i like to entertain people 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.280
 dying to shift programs 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.090
 professor program 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.020
 so actually with probably 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.070
 all and programs that exist 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.450
 they exist to level 1 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.460
 Kalinin essential oils as early as 2003 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.690
 as for his three programs tested 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 Tymoshenko electronics hold 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.250
 a parade of two soloists of them is really like 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 businessmen hard to imagine 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 radio maximum example not so long ago when of 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.580
 broadcast hit parade of the two capitals 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 in n the radio stations rebelled and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 wrote an open letter to the singer Maxim 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.170
 explain what happened there in the number 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320
 his personality heard 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.609
 Aliyev 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.970
 but by and large 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.980
 are themselves to blame for that special 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.910
 guided by this nbu 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.790
 station management and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 Naturally new broom 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.270
 500 Kyiv has changed 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.410
 in the music of the air 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.440
 music has changed 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 and then 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.100
 though she reflected in the hit parade can not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.680
 had to make the next steam 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 changed music last week bottom 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.130
 40 percent on air hit parade remained 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130
 one also needed some kind of words to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.549
 real sector and also activity 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.150
 Russia 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.670
 and that effect which 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.710
 exists at the moment has become more 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.619
 one of the sectors 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.070
 probably it is correct 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 attention earlier floating on 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.309
 people say so along the way 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 Ottoman experimentation 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.849
 apparently it does not enjoy big 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.679
 as popular as we are 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:21.719
 would like to 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.399
 eventually hit parade confirmed 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.859
 zone sad fate befell 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.719
 this week have closed 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.719
 correct electronics 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.979
 I've been crying for a long time 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.659
 bags under the eyes 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.499
 even louder 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.350
 nothing wrong 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.559
 and not happening 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.109
 actually periodically needed 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.399
 some sort 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.899
 in sb pe and 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.989
 need some sort of evaluation black stones and need 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.869
 the kind of person who knocked me ahead 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.169
 met in the air 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.069
 in any case, even the most 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.569
 favorite work with time 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.759
 turns into a routine 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.199
 you need to change the manual periodically 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.949
 change course 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.219
 but he can change 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 place of work 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.729
 some programs 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.499
 all that happens more and more 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.179
 despite the fact that half of their lives 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.329
 legs sent to the radio maximum he still 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.579
 has not changed jobs yet 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.919
 attempts were questions about the role of the actors two 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.949
 films as the panorama writes went to 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:25.570
 the moon 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.600
 as well as a TV presenter 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.700
 programs 1 vs 7 per year but unfortunately 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.570
 last year also closed the program 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.260
 there was very good news and moldova 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.770
 no wonder she became a third nominee in 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.009
 Last year 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.690
 just the program was very expensive 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.479
 because 20 that's how that's how things are 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.729
 from 26 to 29 was involved 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.949
 rubles at a time shot me alone 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.569
 be in love 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.779
 but ohhh about career 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.099
 rape because i'm an introvert for 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.099
 I generally do not shoot from the television 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.689
 so generally step over 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.359
 myself 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.869
 but I really liked it 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.949
 by the way despite your age experience 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.319
 work and professional 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.679
 services such as radio beings and 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.759
 made his way through tokyo suspended 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.019
 a parade of roses and many others condemned to 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.379
 now more want to entertain 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.709
 people club paraphernalia nothing magna 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.319
 no sticks for 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.699
 natural 17 years of work 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.430
 I had but the question is what 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.629
 of course 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.240
 the process I originally 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.650
 I do not consider myself a decoupling functionary 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.639
 then one is necessary to introduce 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.130
 certain type of people 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.590
 without a team came along with the cabinet I 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.890

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.610
 us magical development of my career 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.659
 from the beginning next 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.710
 by the age of forty 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.669
 ii leading positions in such offices 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.770
 the composition of the miner diagnosis deserved 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.199

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.529
 he will need to play music 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:11.830

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.199
 interesting programs 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.689
 but not to be the father of two children with whom he 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.020
