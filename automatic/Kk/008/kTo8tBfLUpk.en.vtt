missile launchers now then overkill for
the<00:05:08.130> cassettes<00:05:08.669> does<00:05:09.090> suffer<00:05:09.480> from<00:05:09.720> something

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
the cassettes does suffer from something

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.390 
the cassettes does suffer from something
that<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.590> feel<00:05:11.690> plagues<00:05:12.690> more<00:05:13.140> than<00:05:13.350> one<00:05:16.400> though

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
that I feel plagues more than one though

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.610 
that I feel plagues more than one though
I<00:05:17.430> do<00:05:17.550> think<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.120> my<00:05:18.600> personal<00:05:19.020> opinion<00:05:19.380> is<00:05:19.530> that

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
I do think I my personal opinion is that

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.550 
I do think I my personal opinion is that
overkill<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.700> worst<00:05:20.910> example<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.560> side

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
overkill is the worst example is side

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.180 
overkill is the worst example is side
view<00:05:22.800> t-rex<00:05:23.310> yeah<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.570> can<00:05:24.780> live<00:05:24.870> with<00:05:24.990> that

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
view t-rex yeah I can live with that

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.810 
view t-rex yeah I can live with that
narrow<00:05:26.190> view<00:05:27.320> not<00:05:28.320> so<00:05:28.620> much

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.730 

I<00:05:31.820> think<00:05:32.390> it<00:05:32.510> does<00:05:32.660> I<00:05:32.810> mean<00:05:32.930> yeah<00:05:33.350> what<00:05:33.500> it's<00:05:33.680> a

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
I think it does I mean yeah what it's a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.050 
I think it does I mean yeah what it's a
cassette<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.280> know<00:05:34.370> it's<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.640> really<00:05:34.850> really

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
cassette you know it's a really really

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.210 
cassette you know it's a really really
clever<00:05:35.360> soil<00:05:35.720> idea<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.800> there's<00:05:36.950> not<00:05:37.040> an<00:05:37.130> awful

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
clever soil idea so there's not an awful

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.070 
clever soil idea so there's not an awful
lot<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:37.820> can<00:05:37.940> do<00:05:38.120> with<00:05:38.150> it<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:38.540> it's

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
lot that you can do with it and it's

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.490 
lot that you can do with it and it's
definitely<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.620> case<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.010> this<00:05:40.100> tends<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.490> be

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
definitely a case that this tends to be

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.410 
definitely a case that this tends to be
it<00:05:42.500> does<00:05:42.710> suffer<00:05:43.070> with<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.430> more<00:05:44.180> for<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
it does suffer with the more for the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.540 
it does suffer with the more for the
animal<00:05:44.870> formers<00:05:45.290> do<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.740> animal<00:05:46.190> cassette

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
animal formers do the animal cassette

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.880 
animal formers do the animal cassette
bots<00:05:46.790> than<00:05:46.970> it<00:05:47.060> does<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:48.140> humanoid<00:05:48.680> ones

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
bots than it does for the humanoid ones

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.920 
bots than it does for the humanoid ones
like<00:05:49.160> Rumble<00:05:49.580> eject<00:05:50.090> rewind<00:05:50.570> frenzy<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:53.180> think

you know you can see that there's a head
they're<00:07:08.240> very<00:07:08.720> very<00:07:08.900> clearly<00:07:09.260> so<00:07:09.950> Overkill's

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
they're very very clearly so Overkill's

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.600 
they're very very clearly so Overkill's
doesn't<00:07:11.540> hide<00:07:11.960> him<00:07:12.170> as<00:07:12.260> cleverly<00:07:12.650> as<00:07:12.950> say<00:07:13.250> ram

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
doesn't hide him as cleverly as say ram

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.680 
doesn't hide him as cleverly as say ram
horns<00:07:14.000> or<00:07:14.150> laser<00:07:14.360> big<00:07:14.600> stars<00:07:18.070> there<00:07:19.070> we<00:07:19.160> go

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
horns or laser big stars there we go

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.360 
horns or laser big stars there we go
okay<00:07:20.690> again<00:07:21.050> does<00:07:21.320> it<00:07:21.500> like<00:07:21.890> with<00:07:22.040> all<00:07:22.190> the

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
okay again does it like with all the

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.070 
okay again does it like with all the
micro<00:07:22.970> cassettes<00:07:23.330> it<00:07:23.480> does<00:07:23.660> come<00:07:23.900> with<00:07:23.930> a

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
micro cassettes it does come with a

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.080 
micro cassettes it does come with a
little<00:07:24.320> what<00:07:24.950> appear<00:07:25.190> to<00:07:25.220> be<00:07:25.340> little<00:07:25.580> spools

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
little what appear to be little spools

little what appear to be little spools
that<00:07:26.600> you<00:07:26.690> can

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.540 

yeah<00:07:33.230> there<00:07:33.350> we<00:07:33.410> go<00:07:33.470> the<00:07:33.920> little<00:07:34.100> gold<00:07:34.310> bits

yeah there we go the little gold bits
there<00:07:34.760> that<00:07:34.940> are<00:07:35.030> spools<00:07:35.390> of<00:07:35.570> a<00:07:35.630> cassette<00:07:35.990> tape

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.020 
there that are spools of a cassette tape

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.720 
there that are spools of a cassette tape
because<00:07:36.380> of<00:07:36.530> course<00:07:36.680> we<00:07:37.220> all<00:07:37.340> know<00:07:37.370> in<00:07:37.670> the

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
because of course we all know in the

I<00:07:55.280> can<00:07:55.460> say<00:07:55.490> about<00:07:55.790> overkill<00:07:56.270> because<00:07:56.450> let's

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.810 
I can say about overkill because let's

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.930 
I can say about overkill because let's
thank<00:07:57.320> me<00:07:57.410> put<00:07:57.590> he<00:07:57.710> doesn't<00:07:57.980> do<00:07:58.310> an<00:07:58.520> awful<00:07:58.670> lot
