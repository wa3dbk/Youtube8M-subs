00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.370
 good afternoon today to introduce you to the gel 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.800
 lacquers of the company Christina which I 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.800
 I order from China from the site aliexpress 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.730
 I have been using varnishes for about six months 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.759
 varnishes order two types of one firm 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.949
 Kristina 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.099
 white bubble to volumes somewhere around 15 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.089
 milliliters 2 bubbles in smaller ones 7 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.480
 and 3 milliliters 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:38.740
 i prefer whites why because 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.910
 colors match the color of the varnish in the catalog 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.570
 let me tell you a little bit and show you 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:50.840
 their color is number 1381 gold 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.690
 I like him very bright 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.860
 very saturated very much 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.860
 micro glitter see how shimmers in 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.869
 camera is probably not very visible but on 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.679
 the sun the varnish just plays for the night and here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.679
 so here about it will look at 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.679
 nails 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.270
 combine it very well with dark ones 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.860
 shades of lacquers as drawings look 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.260
 generally cool let's go on so this is 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 us number number number 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.080
 I do not see the number 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.050
 the light is also brilliant lilac but 1385 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.620
 also a lot of micro gloss color 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.030
 quite transparent but very beautiful 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.210
 looks on nails 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.690
 if you want a brighter color 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 two in three layers and so then there will be 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.040
 look at the nail is also very strong 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.040
 overflows 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.280
 I say once again that we are sunshine 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.610
 1385 looks incredibly beautiful 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.530
 further fuchsia color 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.160
 awesome summer color is very bright and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.440
 very saturated 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 right so insanely bright I him 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 used her manicure 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.760
 but as pictures and so here 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.739
 about he looks on his nails here 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.870
 I got a little bit not dealt 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:39.000
 very fat little enlightened 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:40.920
 the lamp is probably my favorite eggplant 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.430
 color 15-15 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.120
 very dark noble enough 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.120
 expensive color 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.569
 my nails are made from combinations 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.099
 previous 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:03.239
 foxy and this color patlajan 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:08.440
 that's how it looks like on the nails 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.459
 the color is very beautiful I use the top and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:18.760
 the base of the same company keeps nails 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:22.450
 manicure about seven 15 days or here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 such coatings more often I use here 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.260
 these coverings of white christina came to me 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.140
 quite recent so there are not too many 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.510
 tried out only the first time covered 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.799
 let's see what he will hold but 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.120
 I think whether 10 should hold on 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.120
 at least it wanted 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.080
 bottle of 15 milliliters 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.780
 these are the Kristin gel varnishes to me 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.810
 really liked why because 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:04.180
 colors do not match are presented 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.180
 catalogs ordered 4 colors top base 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.400
 blue color wanted him to be more 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:15.669
 bed but it is more transparent 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.930
 the red color is very bright very beautiful 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.930
 also such summer option 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:27.249
 something even looks like terracotta 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:31.210
 Well, it has a light theme rather 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:34.629
 you can probably cover the principle 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.629
 any top 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:48.209
 and number 400 508 caramel color 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:50.249
 nice shepherd color number 405 14 not 

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.149
 I remember she said no cost these varnishes around 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.669
 4 dollars 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.309
 lacquers kristina white about three s 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:01.020
 a half goes I order 10 pieces 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:02.969
 usually here he was decorated 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.409
 one layer if you want you can darken 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:09.119
 waste oil blue lacquer i already in my 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.759
 She said that I would like of course 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:15.539
 he was bed shade but he has 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.789
 micro gloss and transparent enough here 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.320
 it looks good here but the other day 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.490
 it looks 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.010
 not very beautiful somehow greenish 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.820
 the shade that lacquer loved i ordered for 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.560
 french and for drawings but he also does not 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.200
 approached why because too 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.890
 transparent that is to make a french 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.139
 it needs to be applied on shaken and it is very 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.819
 long 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.639
 but basically it was all my first 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.759
 video review if you're interested 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.849
 ask ask questions links i 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:55.289
 I will leave on the seller under the video of all 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.289
 good with you was me
