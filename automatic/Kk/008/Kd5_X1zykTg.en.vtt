it does flatten out the plastic someone
that<00:00:59.969> leaves<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.660> gap<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.199> where

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that leaves a little gap there where

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
that leaves a little gap there where
water<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.039> dirt<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.820> whatever<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.510> inside

but<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.890> does<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.909> cleans<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but it does i think it cleans up the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.289 
but it does i think it cleans up the
