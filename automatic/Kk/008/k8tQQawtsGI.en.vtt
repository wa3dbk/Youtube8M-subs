00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 and thing in this video I will show you how 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.849
 turn on an xbox how to put your usb to 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.509
 xbox and how to learn good control what 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.830
 First things first, how do you see here this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.800
 circuit is the sign to light do not sting 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 and this little dot that is here is that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 it's on good the next step is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 turn on the control the control 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.619
 undertake in this way they leave you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 pressed here and if your control does not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 is synchronized with the xbox the only thing 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.090
 what they have to do here is a button 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 this button is just what they have to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 explain along with this xbox button 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 at the same time so that your xbox will 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 can synchronize with good control 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 the next step since the xbox is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 on and also the control the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 next step is to put them good I guess 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 that have a usb like this or good 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.110
 different here there is a crack after 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 of him after the xbox synchronizer 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 this crack opens like this 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 and let's see that there are two entries here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.420
 usb 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 well here are two usb entries if 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.240
 you can see I think it will be a bit my 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.689
 Finger sorry if 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.549
 and if it looks a bit weird this is good for 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:30.780
 make them easier to grab alone 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.990
 your usb and put the usb to the box and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.799
 they connect it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.009
 If I recommend you put it first 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:45.700
 right side because it's so much easier 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:49.369
 to get it right now I'm going to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.610
 teach how to synchronize it good I said 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.500
 that itched here and there they are 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 synchronizing by themselves well look now you 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.869
 found synchronized as I had my my 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.479
 synchronized xbox because it was synchronized 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.860
 quickly good and how to turn it off 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.880
 is again by clicking the button turn off and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.260
