those don't come with the jig hook in my
rigging<00:00:18.420> method<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.840> pretty<00:00:19.050> similar<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.590> his

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
rigging method is pretty similar to his

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.130 
rigging method is pretty similar to his
where<00:00:20.070> he<00:00:20.189> uses<00:00:20.520> an<00:00:20.640> overhand<00:00:21.150> knot<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
where he uses an overhand knot I like to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
where he uses an overhand knot I like to
use<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.500> Palomar<00:00:23.070> knot<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> always<00:00:23.820> attach

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
use one Palomar knot and I always attach

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.210 
use one Palomar knot and I always attach
it<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> treble<00:00:24.869> hook<00:00:25.039> aight<00:00:26.039> aight<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it to the treble hook aight aight the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
it to the treble hook aight aight the
Palomar<00:00:26.699> knot<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.240> couple<00:00:27.570> overhand

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
Palomar knot and I do a couple overhand

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929 
Palomar knot and I do a couple overhand
knots<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.800> ensure<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.429> doesn't<00:00:29.670> slip<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
knots to ensure that it doesn't slip and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.859 
knots to ensure that it doesn't slip and
then<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
then I like to do a little bit of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.330 
then I like to do a little bit of
superglue<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> make<00:00:31.830> sure<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.189> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
superglue just to make sure that it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120 
superglue just to make sure that it's
rock<00:00:32.759> solid<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> tie<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.680> overhand

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
rock solid and then I tie that overhand

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
rock solid and then I tie that overhand
knot<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> hook<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> actually

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
knot to the hook on this is actually

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.650 
knot to the hook on this is actually
ready<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> fall<00:00:37.200> 12<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> reason<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.420> tied

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
ready to fall 12 and the reason I tied

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
ready to fall 12 and the reason I tied
the<00:00:39.840> overhand<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> hook<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> if

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the overhand to the hook I is that if

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
the overhand to the hook I is that if
you're<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> loosen

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you're you can see I'm about to loosen

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
you're you can see I'm about to loosen
this<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.420> you're<00:00:45.629> fishing<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> roll

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this up if you're fishing and you roll

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
this up if you're fishing and you roll
hook<00:00:47.070> point<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.789> switch<00:00:50.789> Bates

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hook point or you need to switch Bates

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
hook point or you need to switch Bates
maybe<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.020> color<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
maybe you have a different color you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
maybe you have a different color you
want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> try<00:00:52.890> real<00:00:53.129> quick<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.879> if

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
want to try real quick you can see if

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.630 
want to try real quick you can see if
that<00:00:54.149> simple<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.829> rigging<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> off<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.489> can

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that simple that rigging is off you can

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
that simple that rigging is off you can
get<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> leader<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.390> shorter<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
get that leader a lot shorter with this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.160 
get that leader a lot shorter with this
method<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.510> it<00:01:00.510> makes<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> lot

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
method as well and it makes it a lot

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
method as well and it makes it a lot
faster<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.680> easier<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> water<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
faster and easier on the water if you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250 
faster and easier on the water if you
roll<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> point<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.600> take<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
roll that point you can take it off you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.310 
roll that point you can take it off you
can<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.500> other<00:01:04.680> rigs<00:01:05.010> ready<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.519> go

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
can have other rigs ready to go

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.020 
can have other rigs ready to go
switching<00:01:07.320> baits<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.700> stuff<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
switching baits and all that stuff you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
switching baits and all that stuff you
can<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> couple<00:01:10.140> seconds<00:01:11.000> and

is<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.680> have<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.980> loop<00:01:25.160> then<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.610> keep<00:01:25.760> it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
is you have the loop then you keep it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.880 
is you have the loop then you keep it
like<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:29.600> want<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.810> get<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.110> pretty<00:01:30.680> much
