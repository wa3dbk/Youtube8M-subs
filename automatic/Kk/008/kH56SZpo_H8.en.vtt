00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.830 
can become diseased I've actually seen a
plant<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.359> cancer<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.679> their<00:00:32.040> bowel<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.910> we

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
plant with cancer in their bowel and we

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.830 
plant with cancer in their bowel and we
have<00:00:34.469> been<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.040> theater<00:00:35.570> because<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.690> going

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
have been in theater because I'm going

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
have been in theater because I'm going
to<00:00:36.899> X<00:00:37.110> nests<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.930> they<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.260> had<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> take

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to X nests and they actually had to take

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.630 
to X nests and they actually had to take
out<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.300> tissue<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> bomb<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
out all the tissue from the bomb because

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
out all the tissue from the bomb because
it<00:00:45.120> had<00:00:45.629> lots<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.289> cancer<00:00:46.829> cells<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.879> after

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it had lots of cancer cells and after

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
it had lots of cancer cells and after
they<00:00:48.420> sewed<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> bum<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.559> again

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
they sewed the bum up again

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
they sewed the bum up again
the<00:00:50.640> client<00:00:51.059> couldn't<00:00:51.360> stop<00:00:51.629> bleeding

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the client couldn't stop bleeding

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.310 
the client couldn't stop bleeding
because<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.129> vascular<00:00:53.850> area<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
because it's a very vascular area and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
because it's a very vascular area and
the<00:00:55.980> plant<00:00:56.309> nearly<00:00:56.550> died<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.809> had<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the plant nearly died so they had to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.799 
the plant nearly died so they had to
take<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> client<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.399> theater<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.180> they

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
take a client back to theater and they

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.979 
take a client back to theater and they
got<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.289> knife<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.399> slipped<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
got a knife and just slipped down the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.370 
got a knife and just slipped down the
sutures<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:08.000> blood<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> collected

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
sutures and blood because it collected

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
sutures and blood because it collected
in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.820> pouch<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> bomb<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:14.189> become

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in the pouch so the bomb can become

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.719 
in the pouch so the bomb can become
diseased<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.810> skin<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.590> become<00:01:16.740> dizzy<00:01:17.340> by

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
diseased the skin can become dizzy by

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.660 
diseased the skin can become dizzy by

soon as it comes to comes in contact
with<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:38.070> environment<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.880> air<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.810> someone

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
with the environment the air but someone

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.420 
with the environment the air but someone
who<00:01:40.829> wheeze<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.869> they<00:01:42.869> people<00:01:43.740> say<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.340> it

who wheeze it they people say that it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.520 
who wheeze it they people say that it
comes<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.720> people<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.259> drink

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
comes out there are so people can drink

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
comes out there are so people can drink
their<00:01:46.770> own<00:01:46.799> urine<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.470> air<00:01:50.509> has

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
their own urine and but the air has

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.130 
their own urine and but the air has
bacteria<00:01:52.320> viruses<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.000> urine<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.810> then

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bacteria viruses and the urine it then

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.770 
bacteria viruses and the urine it then
becomes<00:01:55.680> contaminated<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.149> obviously<00:01:57.630> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
becomes contaminated so obviously if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.649 
becomes contaminated so obviously if
urine<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.469> sitting<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.640> toilet<00:01:59.850> seat<00:02:00.360> or

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
urine is sitting on the toilet seat or

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.740 
urine is sitting on the toilet seat or
feces<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.450> contaminated<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
feces that's then contaminated and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.940 
feces that's then contaminated and
somebody<00:02:04.469> else<00:02:05.030> sits<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.469> skin

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
somebody else sits on that and the skin

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
somebody else sits on that and the skin
obviously<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:08.879> sensitive

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
obviously is very sensitive

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.000 
obviously is very sensitive
and<00:02:10.200> compete<00:02:11.600> bacteria<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.110> virus<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:16.440> is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and compete bacteria and virus so it is

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.770 
and compete bacteria and virus so it is
an<00:02:17.160> area<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.700> does<00:02:17.940> need<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.480> looked

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
an area that does need to be looked

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
an area that does need to be looked
after<00:02:18.990> because<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.460> kept<00:02:20.880> clean<00:02:21.240> because<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.160 

transferrin<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.160> bacteria<00:02:27.030> especially<00:02:27.960> using

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
transferrin of bacteria especially using

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650 
transferrin of bacteria especially using
toilet<00:02:28.530> seats<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:30.450> talk<00:02:30.630> about
