00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.860
 hi they start making a square of 5 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 x 5 centimeters and cut back then what 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.380
 have to accommodate it as if it were a diamond 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 and raise this point towards this other point 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 in such a way that it becomes a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 triangle then that's it we're going to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.300
 take the first tip and we're going to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 fold half of our figure and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.750
 let's do exactly the same with 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.059
 the other end tending remaining 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.430
 aligned now that you are and we are going to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.370
 take this side of the figure and we're going 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.820
 to bend diagonally to the figure 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.400
 previously made and we are going to make a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.159
 small fold you decide what size 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.890
 and we are going to mark 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 now from the same point we will continue 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.140
 bending keeping it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.119
 exactly on the same edge he cited from the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.299
 previously done and so we are going to 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.759
 finish all that side after you have 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.520
 something like that let's turn our figure 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.909
 in this way and this side of up here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.069
 we are going to fold it down taking care 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.289
 which is aligned with the folds 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.990
 previously made this other side 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.359
 we are going to turn it up again 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 exactly the same as I have to give 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.250
 a tobacco like that now simply 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.009
 unfold the figure and we will do here 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.020
 a small fold that hardly cited 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.439
 note which will be reconverted as in the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.879
 Stalk of our leaf and ready 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.759
 now that we have our figure like that 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.429
 we're just going to open and it's already 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.760
 we have our list sheet hopefully for 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.640
 decorate 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.440
 notebooks or whatever you can think of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.869
 You can make it in different sizes and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.090
 even different colors I hope this 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.490
 tutorial you liked it if it was like that and not 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.410
 forget to subscribe to like and
