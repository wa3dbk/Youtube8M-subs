00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
just the volume is really pretty it did
the<00:01:23.400> annoying<00:01:23.850> part<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.300> you<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> do

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the annoying part is that you have to do

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
the annoying part is that you have to do
able<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:24.990> hang<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.260> your<00:01:25.290> eye<00:01:25.440> but<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.210> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
able to hang on your eye but if you like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
able to hang on your eye but if you like
that<00:01:27.600> mysterious<00:01:28.260> iPad<00:01:28.740> look<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.310> don't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that mysterious iPad look then you don't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
that mysterious iPad look then you don't
mind<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.710> pretty

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
mind that but it's just really pretty

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
mind that but it's just really pretty
and<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> reason<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.759> much<00:01:32.850> volume<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and the reason I have so much volume is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.980 
and the reason I have so much volume is
because<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.229> tracks<00:01:34.560> were<00:01:34.740> laying<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.520> way

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
because the tracks were laying this way

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
because the tracks were laying this way
so<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> flip<00:01:37.649> them<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> other<00:01:38.430> side<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so when I flip them to the other side it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.020 
so when I flip them to the other side it
gives<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> boost<00:01:41.399> at<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> root

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
gives you have like a boost at the root

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
gives you have like a boost at the root
of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> track<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.320> flip<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of the track because it's flip the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
of the track because it's flip the
opposite<00:01:44.009> direction<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.240> gives<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
opposite direction that's what gives you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.340 
opposite direction that's what gives you
that<00:01:45.570> volume<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:47.820> plus<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that volume so I'm plus I have like my

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.289 
that volume so I'm plus I have like my
bangs<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> side<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:50.939> bangs

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
bangs on this side and then these bangs

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
bangs on this side and then these bangs
additionally<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.960> been<00:01:52.110> flipped<00:01:52.289> over<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
additionally have been flipped over so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
additionally have been flipped over so
it's<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:52.920> big<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:54.270> side<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> put
