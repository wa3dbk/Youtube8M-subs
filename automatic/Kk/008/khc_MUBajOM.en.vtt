is too well documented to have been
something<00:04:25.810> obvious<00:04:26.820> but<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.850> do<00:04:28.000> think<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:29.110> it

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
something obvious but I do think that it

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.730 
something obvious but I do think that it
was<00:04:29.410> something<00:04:29.669> exceptional<00:04:30.669> like<00:04:31.150> what

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
I think the situation is summed up by

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.700 
I think the situation is summed up by
Monsieur<00:04:41.430> denna<00:04:42.430> Val<00:04:43.110> who<00:04:44.110> was<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> greatest
