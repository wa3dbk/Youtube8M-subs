and it looks like yellow can assumed
hydrolyse<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.810> Defiler<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> slow<00:01:13.610> that's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
hydrolyse for the Defiler it slow that's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.080 
hydrolyse for the Defiler it slow that's
a<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:15.000> expensive<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.770> um<00:01:16.909> I'm<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.030> sure

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a pretty expensive thing um I'm not sure

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
a pretty expensive thing um I'm not sure
why<00:01:18.450> yellow<00:01:18.810> isn't<00:01:19.439> doing<00:01:19.590> any<00:01:19.799> sense<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.340> all

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
why yellow isn't doing any sense at all

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
why yellow isn't doing any sense at all
I<00:01:20.460> mean<00:01:20.670> yeah<00:01:21.080> would<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.439> effective

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I mean yeah would be pretty effective

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
I mean yeah would be pretty effective
against<00:01:23.009> his<00:01:23.189> tank<00:01:23.430> Marine<00:01:23.670> Force<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
good number with some adrenal gland

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
those science muscles really effectively

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.320 
those science muscles really effectively
to<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.410> replace<00:04:31.280> what<00:04:31.460> he<00:04:31.550> can't<00:04:31.790> replace<00:04:32.090> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.089 
here um looks like yellows mighty gothic
Manor<00:05:06.210> it's<00:05:06.569> a<00:05:06.599> huge<00:05:06.870> loss<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.110> boxer<00:05:07.560> while

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
Manor it's a huge loss to boxer while

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.620 
Manor it's a huge loss to boxer while
he's<00:05:08.400> down<00:05:08.550> with<00:05:08.699> probably<00:05:09.060> one<00:05:09.270> command

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
he's down with probably one command

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.939 
he's down with probably one command
center<00:05:09.870> life<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.169> think<00:05:10.349> that<00:05:10.380> was<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.620> main

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
center life I think that was the main

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.339 
center life I think that was the main
basis<00:05:11.340> command<00:05:11.610> center<00:05:11.910> I'm<00:05:12.300> not<00:05:12.479> sure<00:05:12.539> if

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
basis command center I'm not sure if

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.570 
basis command center I'm not sure if
that<00:05:13.410> was<00:05:13.590> an<00:05:13.680> extra<00:05:13.919> commands<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.340> he<00:05:14.460> made

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
that was an extra commands and he made

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.879 
that was an extra commands and he made
but<00:05:14.729> regardless<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:16.050> disk<00:05:16.319> I<00:05:16.410> her<00:05:16.530> pops<00:05:16.770> her

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
but regardless that disk I her pops her

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.040 
but regardless that disk I her pops her
a<00:05:16.919> lot<00:05:17.160> though<00:05:17.370> um<00:05:18.060> four<00:05:18.569> hundred<00:05:18.780> minerals

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
a lot though um four hundred minerals

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.230 
a lot though um four hundred minerals
worth<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:20.810> nail<00:05:21.810> boxer<00:05:22.229> has<00:05:23.130> just<00:05:23.550> one<00:05:23.910> group

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
worth and nail boxer has just one group

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.120 
worth and nail boxer has just one group
of<00:05:24.330> medic<00:05:24.539> Marines<00:05:24.810> here<00:05:24.960> overlooking<00:05:25.289> his<00:05:25.500> as

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
of medic Marines here overlooking his as

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.659 
of medic Marines here overlooking his as
a<00:05:26.190> space<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:28.229> couple<00:05:28.680> science<00:05:28.979> vessels<00:05:29.280> and

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
a space and a couple science vessels and

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.040 
a space and a couple science vessels and
I<00:05:29.759> think<00:05:30.000> this<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.240> gonna<00:05:30.330> be<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.780> yellows

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
I think this is gonna be the yellows

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.080 
I think this is gonna be the yellows
game<00:05:31.319> actually<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.979> think<00:05:32.370> once<00:05:32.759> again<00:05:32.970> the

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
game actually I think once again the

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.969 
game actually I think once again the
only<00:05:33.300> weakness<00:05:33.599> I<00:05:33.990> baksh<00:05:34.199> i<00:05:34.349> had<00:05:34.500> was<00:05:34.650> macro

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
only weakness I baksh i had was macro

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.089 
only weakness I baksh i had was macro
management<00:05:35.460> unfortunately<00:05:36.419> um<00:05:36.659> he<00:05:37.440> had<00:05:37.470> he

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
management unfortunately um he had he

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.740 
management unfortunately um he had he
destroyed<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.729> many<00:05:38.759> of<00:05:38.940> yellows<00:05:39.180> expansions

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
destroyed so many of yellows expansions

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.990 
destroyed so many of yellows expansions
but<00:05:39.930> just<00:05:40.130> didn't<00:05:41.130> get<00:05:41.310> enough<00:05:41.430> expansions

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
but just didn't get enough expansions

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.870 
but just didn't get enough expansions

being choked to death here um yellow can

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.390 
being choked to death here um yellow can
afford<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.720> lose<00:06:00.900> troops<00:06:01.530> and<00:06:01.710> lose<00:06:01.830> resources

afford to lose troops and lose resources

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.879 
afford to lose troops and lose resources
lose<00:06:02.849> basis<00:06:03.240> because<00:06:03.750> he<00:06:03.960> has<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.409> many<00:06:04.469> bases

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
lose basis because he has so many bases

big<00:06:07.830> hydros<00:06:08.250> force<00:06:08.460> I<00:06:08.580> think<00:06:08.699> those<00:06:08.820> are<00:06:08.849> two

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
big hydros force I think those are two

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.850 
big hydros force I think those are two
two<00:06:09.270> modules<00:06:09.509> actually<00:06:10.050> so<00:06:10.229> they<00:06:10.620> do<00:06:10.710> have

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
two modules actually so they do have

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.969 
two modules actually so they do have
some<00:06:11.009> staying<00:06:11.190> power<00:06:11.280> there<00:06:11.639> um<00:06:12.800> yeah<00:06:13.800> that's

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
some staying power there um yeah that's

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.249 
some staying power there um yeah that's
the<00:06:14.039> first<00:06:14.219> time<00:06:14.280> I've<00:06:14.490> she<00:06:14.969> can<00:06:15.780> take<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.020> note
