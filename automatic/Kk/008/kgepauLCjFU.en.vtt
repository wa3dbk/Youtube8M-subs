have<00:00:01.270> you<00:00:01.420> ever<00:00:01.599> wondered<00:00:01.839> how<00:00:01.990> many<00:00:02.320> calories

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:02.590 
have you ever wondered how many calories

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.309 
have you ever wondered how many calories
you<00:00:02.889> burn<00:00:03.610> in<00:00:03.939> a<00:00:04.060> day<00:00:04.300> well<00:00:04.660> I'm<00:00:04.810> going<00:00:04.990> to<00:00:05.140> try

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:05.319

this<00:00:08.170> short<00:00:08.620> video<00:00:08.770> there<00:00:09.760> are<00:00:09.850> two<00:00:10.000> major

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
this short video there are two major

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.230 
this short video there are two major
components<00:00:10.510> of<00:00:11.050> the<00:00:12.040> total<00:00:12.370> energy<00:00:12.550> we<00:00:13.000> burn

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
components of the total energy we burn

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.330 
components of the total energy we burn
every<00:00:13.570> day<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.530> first<00:00:14.740> one<00:00:14.920> is<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.130> so-called

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
every day the first one is the so-called

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.419 
every day the first one is the so-called
basal<00:00:16.000> metabolic<00:00:16.150> rate<00:00:16.660> which<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.439> the<00:00:17.859> energy

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:18.429 
basal metabolic rate which is the energy

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.909 
basal metabolic rate which is the energy
our<00:00:18.640> body<00:00:18.939> needs<00:00:19.179> and<00:00:19.720> burns<00:00:20.050> to<00:00:20.410> stay<00:00:20.650> alive

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
our body needs and burns to stay alive

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.700 
our body needs and burns to stay alive
while<00:00:21.429> doing<00:00:22.029> nothing<00:00:22.449> while<00:00:22.630> asleep<00:00:23.140> if<00:00:23.529> you

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
while doing nothing while asleep if you

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.640 
while doing nothing while asleep if you
want<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.550> second<00:00:24.910> part<00:00:25.089> is<00:00:25.179> the<00:00:25.300> so-called

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
want the second part is the so-called

energy burn through physical activity
which<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:28.720> essentially<00:00:29.529> self-explanatory<00:00:30.130> is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
which is essentially self-explanatory is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.480 
which is essentially self-explanatory is
the<00:00:30.759> energy<00:00:31.089> will<00:00:31.210> burn<00:00:31.419> by<00:00:31.810> moving

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
the energy will burn by moving

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.220 
the energy will burn by moving
exercising<00:00:33.490> and<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:33.820> forth<00:00:34.120> for<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.050> first

part the basal metabolic rate things are

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.210

activity things are not so simple

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.520 
activity things are not so simple
because<00:01:36.219> as<00:01:36.609> you<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.789> imagine<00:01:37.530> with

different forms of exercise we burn

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.940 
different forms of exercise we burn
different<00:01:40.780> amounts<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.109> calories<00:01:41.710> and

different persons based on their weight
for<00:01:44.709> one<00:01:44.859> thing<00:01:44.889> learn<00:01:45.369> different<00:01:45.969> amounts<00:01:46.359> of

through<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.170> snow<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:56.219> probably<00:01:57.219> use<00:01:57.429> more

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
through this snow I probably use more

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.080 
through this snow I probably use more
energy<00:01:58.049> than<00:01:59.049> if<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.859> were<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.399> walk<00:02:00.670> on<00:02:01.029> a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
energy than if I were to walk on a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.410 
energy than if I were to walk on a
smooth<00:02:01.959> nice<00:02:02.380> surface<00:02:02.920> or<00:02:03.369> if<00:02:03.939> i<00:02:04.090> were<00:02:04.270> to
