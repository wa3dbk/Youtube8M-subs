that<00:01:02.299> point

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
that point

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.810 
that point
but<00:01:03.500> anyway<00:01:03.739> going<00:01:04.009> back<00:01:04.129> now<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.610> set

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
but anyway going back now this is set

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.889 
but anyway going back now this is set
for<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.630> previous<00:01:06.049> rep<00:01:06.729> which<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:08.869> can

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899

sets of three at 70 kilos here so this

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.139 
sets of three at 70 kilos here so this

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
is probably one or two weeks previous to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.880 
is probably one or two weeks previous to
this<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.810> got<00:01:44.990> got<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:45.319> in<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.470> first<00:01:45.619> set

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
this and got got it in the first set

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.690 
this and got got it in the first set
second<00:01:46.310> set<00:01:46.490> could<00:01:46.880> only<00:01:47.000> get<00:01:47.210> two<00:01:47.360> though

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.619 

then<00:01:50.660> anyone<00:01:50.959> going<00:01:51.140> back<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.500> actual<00:01:51.649> day

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:52.629 
then anyone going back to the actual day

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.969 
then anyone going back to the actual day
deadlifts<00:01:53.629> have<00:01:53.750> followed<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.649> this<00:01:54.800> is

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
deadlifts have followed and this is

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.249 
deadlifts have followed and this is
conventional<00:01:55.369> deadlift<00:01:55.970> i<00:01:56.270> alternate

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
conventional deadlift i alternate

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.240 
conventional deadlift i alternate
conventional<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.009> sumo<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:59.030> you've<00:02:00.250> been

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
conventional and sumo if you've been

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.650 
conventional and sumo if you've been
watching<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.640> videos<00:02:01.729> you've<00:02:02.119> seen<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.509> and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
watching the videos you've seen that and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.180 
watching the videos you've seen that and
so<00:02:02.890> 165<00:02:03.890> kilo<00:02:04.310> conventional<00:02:06.039> maybe<00:02:07.039> it's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
so 165 kilo conventional maybe it's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.710 
so 165 kilo conventional maybe it's
because<00:02:07.280> my<00:02:07.369> back's<00:02:07.700> weak<00:02:07.970> or<00:02:08.300> maybe<00:02:08.509> it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
because my back's weak or maybe it's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.650 
because my back's weak or maybe it's
from<00:02:08.869> those<00:02:09.399> squats<00:02:10.399> before<00:02:10.879> being<00:02:11.360> pretty

vlog<00:05:57.590> some<00:05:58.590> slight<00:05:59.210> background<00:06:00.210> in<00:06:00.390> but<00:06:00.600> not

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
vlog some slight background in but not

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.600 
vlog some slight background in but not
too<00:06:00.990> bad

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.270 

and<00:06:07.909> so<00:06:08.389> in<00:06:08.539> deadlifts<00:06:09.020> I<00:06:09.080> just<00:06:09.319> go<00:06:09.470> for<00:06:09.770> three

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
and so in deadlifts I just go for three

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.670 
and so in deadlifts I just go for three
to<00:06:10.430> five<00:06:10.639> reps<00:06:11.060> whatever<00:06:11.659> I<00:06:11.750> can<00:06:12.050> two<00:06:12.319> to<00:06:12.470> five

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
to five reps whatever I can two to five

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.129 
to five reps whatever I can two to five
reps<00:06:13.039> and<00:06:13.580> since<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.389> only<00:06:14.539> got<00:06:14.689> three<00:06:14.960> then

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
reps and since I only got three then

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.439 
reps and since I only got three then
decided<00:06:15.860> to<00:06:15.889> do<00:06:16.069> a<00:06:16.099> drop<00:06:16.699> set<00:06:16.969> so<00:06:17.240> I'll<00:06:17.330> just

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
decided to do a drop set so I'll just

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.820 
decided to do a drop set so I'll just
drop<00:06:17.629> ten<00:06:17.930> kilos<00:06:18.289> off<00:06:18.530> when<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.580> 160<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:21.080> did<00:06:21.800> a

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
drop ten kilos off when to 160 and did a

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.409 
drop ten kilos off when to 160 and did a
back<00:06:22.039> offset<00:06:24.219> and<00:06:25.219> I<00:06:25.310> find<00:06:25.639> that<00:06:25.789> if<00:06:25.939> I<00:06:26.060> do<00:06:26.120> back

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
back offset and I find that if I do back

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.469 
back offset and I find that if I do back
off<00:06:26.599> sets<00:06:26.870> take<00:06:27.439> five<00:06:27.710> ten<00:06:27.919> kilos<00:06:28.280> off<00:06:28.490> my<00:06:29.180> form

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
off sets take five ten kilos off my form

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.369 
off sets take five ten kilos off my form
is<00:06:29.719> a<00:06:29.930> lot<00:06:30.439> better<00:06:30.650> on<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.889> back<00:06:31.069> offset<00:06:31.580> and

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
is a lot better on the back offset and

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.070 
is a lot better on the back offset and
yeah<00:06:33.379> this<00:06:33.530> is<00:06:33.590> 160<00:06:34.400> after<00:06:34.729> already<00:06:34.909> doing<00:06:35.300> 170

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
yeah this is 160 after already doing 170

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.149 
yeah this is 160 after already doing 170
and<00:06:36.740> it<00:06:36.889> looks<00:06:37.099> better<00:06:37.310> than<00:06:37.810> 165<00:06:38.810> kilos<00:06:39.409> as<00:06:40.099> a

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.580 
and it looks better than 165 kilos as a
