the<00:01:38.369> wheat<00:01:38.549> LeBrons<00:01:38.970> fifty<00:01:39.780> dollar<00:01:39.960> price

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the wheat LeBrons fifty dollar price

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.870 
the wheat LeBrons fifty dollar price
difference<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.549> model

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
difference but I really like this model

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.660 
difference but I really like this model
as<00:01:41.970> well<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> wheat<00:01:43.439> LeBrons<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> these

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
as well I if the wheat LeBrons and these

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.830 
as well I if the wheat LeBrons and these
ones<00:01:44.880> were<00:01:44.939> both<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.570> cheaper<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ones were both a little bit cheaper I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
ones were both a little bit cheaper I
would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.110> definitely<00:01:46.320> bought<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
would have definitely bought both of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
would have definitely bought both of
them<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.970> price<00:01:48.329> point<00:01:48.540> issue

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
them but it was just a price point issue

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.830 
them but it was just a price point issue
um<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> LeBron<00:01:51.540> 12

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
um and also I think that the LeBron 12

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.350 
um and also I think that the LeBron 12
model<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.860> has<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.850> I'll<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
model just has way more and I'll just to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
model just has way more and I'll just to
rotate<00:01:54.960> while<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.200> talking<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.890> LeBron<00:01:56.340> 12

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
rotate while I'm talking the LeBron 12

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
rotate while I'm talking the LeBron 12
high<00:01:56.790> top<00:01:57.030> model<00:01:57.329> has<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.659> more<00:01:57.689> color<00:01:58.049> ways

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
high top model has way more color ways

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.340 
high top model has way more color ways
that<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.860> released<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.570> I<00:02:00.570> don't<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.259> if

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that have released and I don't know if

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.660 
that have released and I don't know if
people<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.649> been<00:02:01.740> feeling<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.399> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
people have been feeling them too much I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
people have been feeling them too much I
honestly<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.450> been<00:02:03.630> feeling<00:02:03.750> most<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
honestly have not been feeling most of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
honestly have not been feeling most of
the<00:02:04.259> color<00:02:04.409> ways<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.920> released<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the color ways that have released and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.789 
the color ways that have released and
they're<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.750> frequent<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.649> many

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
they're just so frequent there's so many

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.760 
they're just so frequent there's so many
releases<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> second<00:02:09.539> color<00:02:09.720> way<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
releases this is the second color way to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.240 
releases this is the second color way to
drop<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> LeBron<00:02:11.580> 12

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
drop of the LeBron 12

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.300 
drop of the LeBron 12
and<00:02:12.640> then<00:02:13.330> there's<00:02:13.810> another<00:02:13.870> like<00:02:14.380> us<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.160> kind

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and then there's another like us a kind

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
and then there's another like us a kind
of<00:02:15.430> color<00:02:15.610> way<00:02:15.790> that's<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:16.990> dropping

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
of color way that's going to be dropping

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500 
of color way that's going to be dropping
pretty<00:02:17.350> soon<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:17.710> well<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.700> think<00:02:19.270> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
pretty soon as well but this I think the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.740 
pretty soon as well but this I think the
other<00:02:19.630> reason<00:02:19.990> why<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.310> LeBron<00:02:21.610> 12<00:02:21.940> low<00:02:22.540> has

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
other reason why the LeBron 12 low has

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.800 
other reason why the LeBron 12 low has
been<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.200> well-received<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:24.280> because<00:02:25.090> they

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
been so well-received is because they

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.020 
been so well-received is because they
are<00:02:26.170> dropping<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.950> sporadically<00:02:27.610> they're<00:02:27.880> not

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
are dropping so sporadically they're not

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.320 
are dropping so sporadically they're not
just<00:02:28.630> having<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.350> huge<00:02:29.650> massive<00:02:30.250> release<00:02:31.000> like

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
just having a huge massive release like

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
just having a huge massive release like
normal<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.840> seems<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.590> this

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
normal it seems to be kind of like this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.740 
normal it seems to be kind of like this
doors<00:02:33.580> getting<00:02:33.760> them<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.480> stores

there's a huge push for it I don't
understand<00:02:51.400> why<00:02:51.520> they're<00:02:51.730> doing<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.940> it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
understand why they're doing that it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.840 
understand why they're doing that it
could<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.950> logistical<00:02:53.950> issues<00:02:54.640> with

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
could you just be logistical issues with

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.120 
could you just be logistical issues with
the<00:02:55.300> shipping<00:02:55.510> I'm<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.320> really<00:02:56.470> sure<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
the shipping I'm not really sure but I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.760 
the shipping I'm not really sure but I
think<00:02:57.340> because<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.970> mystery<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.900> well<00:02:59.560> is

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
think because of that mystery of well is

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.920 
think because of that mystery of well is
my<00:03:00.280> store<00:03:00.580> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> get<00:03:00.910> some<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.600> this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
my store going to get some or is this

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.470 
my store going to get some or is this
store<00:03:02.170> not<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.739> some<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:04.270> adds

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
store not going to get some on that adds

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.690 
store not going to get some on that adds
a<00:03:04.630> little<00:03:04.720> bit<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.020> hype<00:03:05.830> i<00:03:06.010> guess<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.489> some

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
a little bit of hype i guess to some

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.630 
a little bit of hype i guess to some
people's<00:03:07.440> viewpoints<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.890> sneakers<00:03:09.070> so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
people's viewpoints of the sneakers so

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.760 
people's viewpoints of the sneakers so
Annie<00:03:10.300> no<00:03:10.420> hype<00:03:10.570> cells<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.200> that's<00:03:11.470> definitely

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
Annie no hype cells so that's definitely

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.910 
Annie no hype cells so that's definitely
the<00:03:12.459> way<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> think<00:03:13.239> people<00:03:13.989> are<00:03:14.110> more<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.890> tune

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
the way I think people are more in tune

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.490 
the way I think people are more in tune
with<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.730> low<00:03:15.880> top<00:03:16.120> models<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.720> think<00:03:17.350> that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
with the low top models I think that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.140 
with the low top models I think that
after<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.920> while<00:03:18.160> though<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.820> could<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
after a while though it could be a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.910 
after a while though it could be a
strategy<00:03:20.019> i'm<00:03:20.110> not<00:03:20.230> really<00:03:20.320> sure<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.650> after<00:03:20.890> a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
strategy i'm not really sure but after a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.979 
strategy i'm not really sure but after a
while<00:03:21.010> i'm<00:03:21.610> assuming<00:03:21.910> we'll<00:03:22.360> see<00:03:22.570> nike.com

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
