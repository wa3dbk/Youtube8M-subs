00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
hi guys it's been and we're here for our

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.590 
hi guys it's been and we're here for our
third<00:00:09.530> Java<00:00:10.190> tutorial<00:00:10.760> and<00:00:10.940> today<00:00:11.150> we're

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
third Java tutorial and today we're

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.339 
third Java tutorial and today we're
doing<00:00:11.780> a<00:00:12.670> calculator<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.390> we've<00:00:15.140> got<00:00:15.320> a

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
doing a calculator so we've got a

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.050 
doing a calculator so we've got a
scanner<00:00:15.680> setup<00:00:15.950> so<00:00:16.309> that<00:00:16.340> they<00:00:16.520> can<00:00:16.700> enter<00:00:16.970> the

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
scanner setup so that they can enter the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.470 
scanner setup so that they can enter the
numbers<00:00:17.390> they<00:00:17.539> want<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:17.900> be<00:00:18.080> added<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.360> like<00:00:20.360> I

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
numbers they want to be added so like I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.970 
numbers they want to be added so like I
said<00:00:20.539> in<00:00:20.720> like<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.230> first<00:00:21.380> one<00:00:21.710> we're<00:00:21.890> going

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
said in like the first one we're going

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.220 
said in like the first one we're going
to<00:00:22.039> make<00:00:22.160> a<00:00:22.369> new<00:00:22.610> earth<00:00:22.970> double<00:00:23.779> which<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.199> a

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
to make a new earth double which is a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.510 
to make a new earth double which is a
number<00:00:24.529> which<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:24.710> can<00:00:24.949> have<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:27.100> number<00:00:28.100> which

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
number which you can have a number which

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.310 
number which you can have a number which
can<00:00:28.550> have<00:00:29.150> decimals<00:00:29.750> in<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:29.960> i'm<00:00:30.050> just<00:00:30.199> going

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
can have decimals in it i'm just going

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.819 
can have decimals in it i'm just going
to<00:00:30.380> call<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:30.560> first<00:00:31.400> number<00:00:32.499> like<00:00:33.499> that<00:00:33.940> okay

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
to call this first number like that okay

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.200 
to call this first number like that okay
then<00:00:36.829> we're<00:00:36.979> going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.159> make<00:00:37.249> another<00:00:37.609> one

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
then we're going to make another one

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.020 
then we're going to make another one
called<00:00:38.920> second<00:00:40.449> num<00:00:41.499> number<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:43.999> can

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
called second num number that you can

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.459 
called second num number that you can
call<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:44.389> whatever<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:44.719> want<00:00:44.780> as<00:00:45.139> they<00:00:45.319> are

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
call it whatever you want as they are

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.860 
call it whatever you want as they are
called<00:00:45.589> variables<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:46.549> they<00:00:46.699> are<00:00:46.870> variable

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
called variables so they are variable

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.989 
called variables so they are variable
and<00:00:48.429> double<00:00:50.199> answer<00:00:51.199> okay<00:00:51.979> so<00:00:52.760> we've<00:00:52.850> got<00:00:52.969> a

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
and double answer okay so we've got a

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.090 
and double answer okay so we've got a
first<00:00:53.299> time<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.569> second<00:00:53.870> number<00:00:53.959> an<00:00:54.139> answer<00:00:54.469> now

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
first time a second number an answer now

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.090 
first time a second number an answer now
they<00:00:55.309> need<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.609> be<00:00:55.729> equal<00:00:56.209> to<00:00:56.749> what<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.589> person

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
they need to be equal to what the person

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.750 
they need to be equal to what the person
who's<00:00:58.549> running<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.089> puts<00:00:59.659> in<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.339> if<00:01:01.339> we<00:01:01.489> put

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
who's running this puts in so if we put

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.840 
who's running this puts in so if we put
first<00:01:03.129> number<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.840> equal<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:06.820> scanner<00:01:09.850> dot

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
first number is equal to scanner dot

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.120 
first number is equal to scanner dot
next<00:01:11.230> double<00:01:12.760> like<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:15.680> well<00:01:15.950> that's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
next double like that that well that's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.500 
next double like that that well that's
going<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:16.730> going<00:01:17.000> to<00:01:17.090> set<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
going to do is it's going to set the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.260 
going to do is it's going to set the
first<00:01:17.810> number<00:01:18.080> equal<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.580> what<00:01:19.730> they've<00:01:19.910> put

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
first number equal to what they've put

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.090 
first number equal to what they've put
in<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.570> because<00:01:21.080> it's<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.320> type<00:01:21.620> of<00:01:21.650> double

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
in and because it's a type of double

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.580 
in and because it's a type of double
we've<00:01:22.490> gotta<00:01:22.730> do<00:01:22.880> next<00:01:23.360> double<00:01:23.720> enough<00:01:24.470> to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
we've gotta do next double enough to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.730 
we've gotta do next double enough to
give<00:01:24.710> them<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.860> little<00:01:24.980> prompt<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.390> put<00:01:27.290> this

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
give them a little prompt to put this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.440 
give them a little prompt to put this
ends<00:01:28.010> which<00:01:28.220> going<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.490> do<00:01:28.610> system<00:01:29.300> dot<00:01:29.390> out

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
ends which going to do system dot out

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.670 
ends which going to do system dot out
dot<00:01:29.570> print<00:01:29.960> line<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.210> we're<00:01:32.210> going<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> say

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
dot print line and we're going to say

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.060 
dot print line and we're going to say
enter<00:01:33.680> your<00:01:34.450> first<00:01:36.430> number<00:01:37.840> brah<00:01:38.950> brah<00:01:39.950> brah

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
enter your first number brah brah brah

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.940 
enter your first number brah brah brah
brah<00:01:40.600> brah<00:01:42.820> yeah<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.290> gets<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.740> first

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
brah brah yeah so then it gets the first

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.770 
brah brah yeah so then it gets the first
number<00:01:46.159> just<00:01:46.490> like<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:47.390> we're<00:01:47.659> going

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
number just like that so now we're going

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.880 
number just like that so now we're going
to<00:01:47.840> get<00:01:47.960> their<00:01:48.170> second<00:01:48.590> number<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.010> system

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
to get their second number so system

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.100 
to get their second number so system
system<00:01:51.890> dot<00:01:52.190> out<00:01:52.250> dot<00:01:52.750> print<00:01:54.490> print<00:01:55.780> line<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
system dot out dot print print line and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.640 
system dot out dot print print line and
we're<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.560> say<00:01:59.110> into<00:02:00.110> your<00:02:01.150> second

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
we're going to say into your second

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.810 
we're going to say into your second
number<00:02:04.000> bro<00:02:05.000> yeah<00:02:05.659> our<00:02:05.990> arrow<00:02:06.350> note<00:02:07.190> bro<00:02:07.550> and

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
number bro yeah our arrow note bro and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.759 
number bro yeah our arrow note bro and
then<00:02:08.810> we're<00:02:08.899> going<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.079> get<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> second

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
then we're going to get the second

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.590 
then we're going to get the second
number<00:02:09.889> by<00:02:10.310> doing<00:02:10.810> second<00:02:11.859> number<00:02:12.859> and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
number by doing second number and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.840 
number by doing second number and
equal<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.770> scanner<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:15.730> going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
equal to the scanner so that it's going

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.400 
equal to the scanner so that it's going
to<00:02:15.940> scan<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.180> what<00:02:16.390> they've<00:02:16.510> said<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.960> next

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
to scan for what they've said and next

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.300 
to scan for what they've said and next
double<00:02:17.770> we're<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.940> next<00:02:20.280> part<00:02:21.280> number

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.160 

okay<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.110> answer<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.360> equal<00:02:31.360> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
okay so now we can do answer is equal to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.630 
okay so now we can do answer is equal to
the<00:02:32.290> first<00:02:32.560> number<00:02:33.690> plus<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:35.470> second<00:02:36.070> number

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the first number plus the second number

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.140 
the first number plus the second number
so<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.530> like<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.280> math<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.000> can

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so it's just like in in math so you can

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.300 
so it's just like in in math so you can
you<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.540> add<00:02:40.900> add<00:02:41.140> or<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:42.010> could<00:02:42.190> do

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you can just add add or you could do

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
you can just add add or you could do
minus<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.330> could<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.690> divide<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.650> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
minus or you could do divide it's just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.970 
minus or you could do divide it's just
that<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.250> then<00:02:45.930> multiplies<00:02:46.930> asterisks<00:02:47.710> so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
that and then multiplies asterisks so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.110 
that and then multiplies asterisks so
we're<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> add<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:49.000> case<00:02:49.240> though

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
we're going to add in this case though

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.850 
we're going to add in this case though
so<00:02:52.120> now<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:54.210> system<00:02:55.210> dot<00:02:56.110> out<00:02:56.170> dot

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
so now we can do system dot out dot

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.830 
so now we can do system dot out dot
print<00:02:57.850> line<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:59.400> we<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.580> print<00:03:00.850> out<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
print line and we can print out the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.320 
print line and we can print out the
answer<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.550> could<00:03:03.730> say<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:05.280> answer<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
answer so we could say the answer to and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.580 
answer so we could say the answer to and
then<00:03:07.930> after<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.340> put<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:10.080> speech<00:03:11.080> mark<00:03:11.380> if<00:03:11.560> you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
then after you put a speech mark if you

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.320 
then after you put a speech mark if you
want<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:11.830> add<00:03:11.920> something<00:03:12.250> else<00:03:12.580> into<00:03:13.150> your

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
want to add something else into your

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.630 
want to add something else into your
string<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.050> put<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> plus<00:03:14.530> sign<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.430> what

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
string you put a plus sign and then what

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360 
string you put a plus sign and then what
you<00:03:15.760> want<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.030> add<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> answer<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
you want to add so the answer to the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.610 
you want to add so the answer to the
first<00:03:18.760> number<00:03:20.040> plus<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.400> plus<00:03:22.300> sign<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.320> put

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
first number plus a plus sign now we put

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.790 
first number plus a plus sign now we put
these<00:03:23.770> spaces<00:03:24.070> here<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.520> it's<00:03:24.670> not<00:03:24.880> all

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
these spaces here so it's not all

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.650 
these spaces here so it's not all
connected<00:03:26.800> together<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.460> it's<00:03:27.820> it's<00:03:28.330> space

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
connected together so it's it's space

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.690 
connected together so it's it's space
like<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.990> normally<00:03:29.080> would<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.220> answer<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
like it normally would so the answer to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.730 
like it normally would so the answer to
the<00:03:30.820> first<00:03:31.030> number<00:03:31.390> add<00:03:33.420> second<00:03:34.420> number<00:03:36.420> add

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
the first number add second number add

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.030 
the first number add second number add
is<00:03:38.940> equal<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:42.130> answer<00:03:42.960> just<00:03:43.960> like<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.290> so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
is equal to the answer just like that so

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.280 
is equal to the answer just like that so
it's<00:03:45.730> going<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:45.970> print<00:03:46.240> out<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.630> answer<00:03:47.080> to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it's going to print out the answer to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
it's going to print out the answer to
the<00:03:47.800> first<00:03:48.130> number<00:03:48.550> so<00:03:49.120> whatever<00:03:49.270> they<00:03:49.510> typed

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
the first number so whatever they typed

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.800 
the first number so whatever they typed
in<00:03:49.900> plus<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:51.490> second<00:03:52.000> number<00:03:52.270> forever<00:03:52.570> they

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
in plus the second number forever they

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.440 
in plus the second number forever they
typed<00:03:53.020> in<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.890> be<00:03:53.950> equal<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.610> first

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
typed in is going to be equal to first

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.510 
typed in is going to be equal to first
number<00:03:55.900> plus<00:03:56.350> second<00:03:57.130> number<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.750> if<00:03:59.020> we<00:03:59.680> do<00:03:59.890> if

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
number plus second number so if we do if

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.540 
number plus second number so if we do if
we<00:04:00.580> run<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.890> says<00:04:03.040> enter<00:04:03.220> your<00:04:03.430> first

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
we run this it says enter your first

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.570 
we run this it says enter your first
number<00:04:03.970> brah<00:04:04.180> plus<00:04:05.080> about<00:04:05.230> 50<00:04:05.650> into<00:04:06.490> your

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
number brah plus about 50 into your

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.410 
number brah plus about 50 into your
second<00:04:06.970> number<00:04:07.240> 50.5<00:04:08.140> we're<00:04:08.410> going<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.620> get

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
second number 50.5 we're going to get

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.950 
second number 50.5 we're going to get
100.5<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:11.470> like<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.720> next

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
100.5 just like that so in the next

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.500 
100.5 just like that so in the next
tutorial<00:04:14.700> we're<00:04:15.700> going<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:16.030> be<00:04:16.120> going<00:04:16.270> over

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
tutorial we're going to be going over

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
tutorial we're going to be going over
methods<00:04:17.170> which<00:04:18.130> are<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.670> key<00:04:19.120> thing<00:04:19.810> which

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
methods which are a key thing which

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.110 
methods which are a key thing which
you're<00:04:20.680> going<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:20.920> need<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.310> your<00:04:21.400> Java<00:04:21.669> so

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
you're going to need in your Java so

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.350 
you're going to need in your Java so
like<00:04:22.510> watching<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.110> goodbye
