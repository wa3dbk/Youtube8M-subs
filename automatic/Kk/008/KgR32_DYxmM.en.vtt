00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
one place a little too soon we'll

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.319 
one place a little too soon we'll
probably<00:03:59.560> sat<00:03:59.829> down<00:03:59.980> with<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.310> diamond<00:04:00.700> and

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
probably sat down with a diamond and

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.620 
probably sat down with a diamond and
that<00:04:01.360> diamond<00:04:02.349> reduces<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.250> porcelain<00:04:03.880> but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
that diamond reduces the porcelain but

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.870 
that diamond reduces the porcelain but
it<00:04:04.720> leaves<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.959> little<00:04:05.170> rough<00:04:05.319> surface<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:06.549> in

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
it leaves a little rough surface so in

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.850 
it leaves a little rough surface so in
order<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.150> bring<00:04:07.569> it<00:04:07.750> back<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.140> smooth<00:04:08.500> glaze

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
order to bring it back to a smooth glaze

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.099 
order to bring it back to a smooth glaze
like<00:04:09.459> an<00:04:09.609> mo<00:04:09.790> would<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.180> we'll<00:04:10.930> go<00:04:11.079> through
