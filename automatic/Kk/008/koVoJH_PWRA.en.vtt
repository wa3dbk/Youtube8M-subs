assuming I think Firefox will have
something<00:01:12.119> pop<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:12.930> say<00:01:12.990> run

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this plug-in or something like that but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.560 
this plug-in or something like that but
I<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.479> click<00:01:15.930> run<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> plugins<00:01:16.860> and

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
characters a little big I think a little

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.979 
characters a little big I think a little
more<00:03:37.879> grayer<00:03:38.419> is<00:03:39.639> because<00:03:40.639> um<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.659> but<00:03:41.840> when

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
more grayer is because um the but when

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.140 
more grayer is because um the but when
blue<00:03:42.229> and<00:03:42.409> red<00:03:42.590> kind<00:03:43.159> of<00:03:43.250> mix<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.669> little<00:03:43.760> bit<00:03:44.000> it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
blue and red kind of mix a little bit it

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.879 
blue and red kind of mix a little bit it
kind<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.389> makes<00:03:44.599> like<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> gray<00:03:45.079> color<00:03:45.319> blue<00:03:45.680> red

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
kind of makes like a gray color blue red

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.680 
kind of makes like a gray color blue red
and<00:03:45.919> green<00:03:46.040> all<00:03:46.459> together<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.359> a<00:03:47.389> lot<00:03:47.569> of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and green all together so I get a lot of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.689 
and green all together so I get a lot of
kills<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.319> get<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.829> lot<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.099> deaths<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.519> get<00:03:49.669> a

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
kills I get a lot of deaths and I get a

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.360 
kills I get a lot of deaths and I get a
lot<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:49.940> assists<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.079> don't<00:03:51.470> know<00:03:51.590> too<00:03:52.190> much

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
lot of assists but I don't know too much

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.210 
lot of assists but I don't know too much
about<00:03:52.430> how<00:03:53.090> many<00:03:53.379> deaths<00:03:54.379> I<00:03:54.650> get<00:03:54.889> because<00:03:55.099> I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
about how many deaths I get because I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.879 
about how many deaths I get because I
don't<00:03:55.459> really<00:03:55.879> die<00:03:56.090> too<00:03:56.629> often<00:03:57.139> but<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.349> guess<00:03:57.769> I

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
don't really die too often but I guess I

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.259 
don't really die too often but I guess I
have<00:03:58.040> those<00:03:58.220> games<00:03:58.400> where<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.699> just<00:03:58.879> die<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.030> lot

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
have those games where I just die a lot

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.140 
have those games where I just die a lot
and<00:03:59.599> feed<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.260> know<00:04:00.349> all<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.889> good<00:04:01.069> stuff

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
and feed you know all that good stuff

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.659 
and feed you know all that good stuff
anyways<00:04:02.150> um<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:03.799> let's<00:04:04.010> check<00:04:04.189> out<00:04:04.340> nerves

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
anyways um so let's check out nerves

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.910 
anyways um so let's check out nerves
poor<00:04:05.329> Oh

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.480 

okay<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:10.980> nerves<00:04:11.670> poro<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.630> dark<00:04:13.320> blue<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:14.460> a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
okay so nerves poro is dark blue like a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.400 
okay so nerves poro is dark blue like a
dark<00:04:15.000> really<00:04:15.330> dark<00:04:15.480> grayish<00:04:16.140> blue<00:04:16.560> color<00:04:16.859> now

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
dark really dark grayish blue color now

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.229 
dark really dark grayish blue color now
the<00:04:19.410> reason<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.100> dark<00:04:20.340> grey<00:04:20.609> or<00:04:20.670> blue<00:04:21.090> is

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the reason it's a dark grey or blue is

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.970 
the reason it's a dark grey or blue is
because<00:04:21.390> obviously<00:04:22.200> he<00:04:22.350> gets<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.590> lot<00:04:22.920> of

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
because obviously he gets a lot of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.140 
because obviously he gets a lot of
deaths<00:04:23.370> which<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.210> blue<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.410> makes<00:04:25.740> sense

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
deaths which is blue so that makes sense

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.910 
deaths which is blue so that makes sense
really<00:04:27.150> short<00:04:27.570> leg<00:04:27.930> length<00:04:28.230> well<00:04:28.530> he's<00:04:28.650> got<00:04:28.890> a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
really short leg length well he's got a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.890 
really short leg length well he's got a
longer<00:04:29.340> leg<00:04:29.580> length<00:04:29.820> than<00:04:30.060> me<00:04:30.240> that's<00:04:30.510> it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
longer leg length than me that's it's

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.860 
longer leg length than me that's it's
weird<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.500> don't<00:04:31.590> know<00:04:31.860> but<00:04:32.850> yeah<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.180> doesn't

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
weird I don't know but yeah it doesn't

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.600 
weird I don't know but yeah it doesn't
put<00:04:34.170> wards<00:04:34.470> down<00:04:34.680> as<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.220> see<00:04:35.370> with<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
small eyes in the glasses big long

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.130 
small eyes in the glasses big long
tongue<00:04:38.160> because<00:04:38.430> he<00:04:38.520> plays<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.910> DC<00:04:39.240> but<00:04:39.660> anyways
