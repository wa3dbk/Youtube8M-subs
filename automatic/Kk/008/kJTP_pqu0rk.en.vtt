00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.849
 I'm going to do something about this tree done right 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.130
 I need some Qigong exercises I need to do this and not do anything minutes * 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.800
 I think it 's a practice when you plant it.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 There may be a bulging flesh and bone of work done is not just determined 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 On the head * Judgment of the judge is right.

 Good. It's bad. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.899
 Boron is right or wrong so you decided to act on the hair to take it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.359

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.950
 I am meditating, and this is what I am doing. 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.570
 I think it is not a practice if you think that you are working in the field of life. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 It's a big mistake. The one who does it with your heart is doing it. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 If you look at the victims of life, 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.890
 I have to know how to write it with my heart. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.390
 I do not have a chance. 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.310
 That is why he has taken when the heart was something else 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.480
 It 's an idea if you go headless . 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.760
 Rather did that font that karma is thicker, so sometimes the performance of sabogo 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.940
 If you come here, 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.410
 I do not know how to do it with my heart, I almost want to sell it.

 I'm talking like this. 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:12.650
 You are a true performer. The true performing group is the person 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.060
 I'll lead you to it. 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.960

 You can listen to lectures with your heart and help others with your heart and exercise with your heart. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.770
 If you are a performer, why do you do it with your heart? 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.730
 You use energy. 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.330
 When the energy of mind is all written out, it is 9 times enlightenment . 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.110
 Why do you keep your head in your heart? 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.330
 When you keep a head alive rather it becomes thickened heart energy plant produce minutes * 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.220

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:50.300
 When you look at the body of your Bible, it is said that you have fallen into hell after you have consumed the sanctification and the cloth. 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.260
 I'm not the one who is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had to look like an apple tree of the knowledge of good and evil 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.459
 This is not it. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.370
 I am in pain when I feel a sense of good and evil. 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.990
 It's right . 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:09.020
 It's true. It's not true . 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.850
 The moment man is the advent of sound mind I'm stuck in my mind that the convergence 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.910
 I 'm going to suffer. 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.780
 Do not be disgusted in the impossible. 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.220
 It is the enlightenment that transcends understanding in the head . 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.690
 The ordinary person lives with his head, but the performer must live with his heart. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.750
 When I live, I see my heart, I see my heart. 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.400
 So I 'm going to enlightenment. 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.410

 We live better lives, the land value of life and the divine self to some 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:48.110
 To the extent that these things work very well , such as hobbies, etc. 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.670
 I can not go to enlightenment, but I do not know what I am doing with my heart . 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.070
 When we get to know the idea we are talking about, 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.570
 Realize happened 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:04.490

 There is a person to be thick and a person who is full of heart . 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.490
 When I hear it with my heart and break it, I hear my wave and there is a resonance in my heart. 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.300
 When broken 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:37.310
 And if he judges that he is hungry and hears it in his head, 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.130
 What does the author say about this? If this is the case, 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.940
 It's not melting, but building. 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.390
 Heart-old rather large're also one's true 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:52.400

 You can see your heart because it's open. 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.610
 Many people who have exercised so are often open to heart. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.360
 If you come to perform Lots 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:31.160
 Those who used their body more than those who did not exercise,

 If the only reason for the body mind and body is an open mind Xia Dynasty is not the state 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.919

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:48.559
 But if you do it mostly , your mind will be opened, your subconscious will open, 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:52.249
 If you exercise while you look at it, you will lose a lot of energy. 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:56.629
