00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
instead of pulling the ends away from

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
instead of pulling the ends away from
each<00:00:52.289> other<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> slide<00:00:53.879> those<00:00:54.090> chains<00:00:54.390> onto

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
each other so slide those chains onto

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.950 
each other so slide those chains onto
your<00:00:55.590> jump<00:00:55.829> ring<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.570> then<00:00:57.570> you'll<00:00:57.719> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
your jump ring and then you'll just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
your jump ring and then you'll just
close<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.370> tip<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.850> jump<00:01:00.059> rings

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
close it and a little tip for jump rings

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.009 
close it and a little tip for jump rings
is<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> hear<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> click<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:03.780> bring

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is you can hear it click and then bring

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
is you can hear it click and then bring
the<00:01:04.140> ends<00:01:04.379> back<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.739> each<00:01:04.860> other<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> that's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the ends back to each other and that's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
the ends back to each other and that's
how<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.180> closed<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> very

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
how you know that it's closed and very

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.190 
how you know that it's closed and very
secure<00:01:08.010> okay<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.060> you'll<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> both

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
secure okay so you'll do that on both

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480 
secure okay so you'll do that on both
sides<00:01:11.750> connecting<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:13.409> creating<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> place

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
sides connecting up creating a place

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980

past and back together okay now to make

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.109 
past and back together okay now to make
a<00:01:27.060> beaded<00:01:27.420> drop<00:01:28.009> sometimes<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.700> gemstone

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

beads<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> bigger<00:01:30.869> hole<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.530> what

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
beads they have a bigger hole then what

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530

will<00:01:31.829> fit<00:01:32.040> onto<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.579> head<00:01:32.729> pin<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:33.210> these

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
will fit onto your head pin even these

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.120 
will fit onto your head pin even these
decorative<00:01:33.869> headpins<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> ball<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
decorative headpins with the ball on the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
decorative headpins with the ball on the
end<00:01:35.159> would<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.790> through<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.960> an<00:01:37.170> easy

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
end would go right through so an easy

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
end would go right through so an easy
fix<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> use<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> rondell<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
fix for that is to use a rondell or a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440 
fix for that is to use a rondell or a
small<00:01:40.110> flat<00:01:40.560> bead<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> end<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> your<00:01:42.210> pin

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
small flat bead at the end of your pin

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
small flat bead at the end of your pin
and<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.409> makes<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> fit<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.270> course

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and that makes it fit and then of course

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.690 
and that makes it fit and then of course
you'll<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> make<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> beaded<00:01:46.829> wrapped

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you'll want to make a beaded wrapped

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.170 
you'll want to make a beaded wrapped
loop<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.649> make<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.340> 90-degree<00:01:50.909> bend

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
loop here so I make my 90-degree bend

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.940 
loop here so I make my 90-degree bend
and<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> come<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> round<00:01:52.740> nose

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and then I come with the round nose

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then I come with the round nose
pliers<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.350> loop<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.460> have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
pliers and just make my loop and I have

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
pliers and just make my loop and I have
a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.939> bit<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> tail<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a little bit of a tail here and it's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
a little bit of a tail here and it's
just<00:01:58.200> enough<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.070> fit<00:01:59.340> over<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
just enough that it will fit over the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.030 
just enough that it will fit over the
chain<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.960> I'll<00:02:01.290> connect<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
chain so I'll connect this like that

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.480 
chain so I'll connect this like that
onto<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> middle

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
onto the middle

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.389 
onto the middle
or<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.540> abouts<00:02:06.890> because<00:02:07.890> you're<00:02:08.039> creating

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
or there abouts because you're creating

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.490 
or there abouts because you're creating
two<00:02:08.670> layers<00:02:08.929> you'll<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> make<00:02:10.470> sure

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
two layers you'll just want to make sure

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
two layers you'll just want to make sure
that<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> beads<00:02:11.129> are<00:02:11.400> placed<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.090> they

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that the beads are placed so that they

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
that the beads are placed so that they
spread<00:02:14.110> across<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.440> chain<00:02:14.830> fairly<00:02:15.790> evenly

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
spread across the chain fairly evenly

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
spread across the chain fairly evenly
and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.560> can<00:02:17.710> coil<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.220> one<00:02:18.370> around

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and then you can coil this one around

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.790 
and then you can coil this one around
and<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.660> enough<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.440> will<00:02:20.560> keep

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and it's just enough that it will keep

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.890 
and it's just enough that it will keep
that<00:02:20.980> loop<00:02:21.190> closed<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.180> will<00:02:22.600> tuck

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that loop closed and then I will tuck

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400 
that loop closed and then I will tuck
this<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:23.470> my<00:02:23.500> chain<00:02:23.860> nose<00:02:24.040> pliers<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this in with my chain nose pliers and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
this in with my chain nose pliers and
you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.860> really<00:02:27.130> close<00:02:27.460> there<00:02:27.820> using

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you can get it really close there using

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.090 
you can get it really close there using
your<00:02:28.480> pliers<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.320> can<00:02:29.500> trim<00:02:29.740> off<00:02:29.770> that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
your pliers or you can trim off that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.170 
your pliers or you can trim off that
little<00:02:30.340> extra<00:02:30.640> end<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.380> press<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.280> then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
little extra end so press that and then

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.270 
little extra end so press that and then
you<00:02:34.360> would<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.750> create<00:02:35.260> create<00:02:36.070> your

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you would just create create your

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.610 
you would just create create your
layered<00:02:36.550> effect<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.600> your<00:02:37.780> first<00:02:37.990> row<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
layered effect do your first row and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.100 
layered effect do your first row and
then<00:02:38.800> place<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> top<00:02:39.520> ones<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:40.030> between<00:02:40.240> your

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
then place the top ones in between your

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.650 
then place the top ones in between your
bottom<00:02:41.470> row<00:02:41.620> now<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.610> attach<00:02:43.030> your<00:02:43.270> ribbon

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
bottom row now to attach your ribbon

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.260 
bottom row now to attach your ribbon
what<00:02:44.470> you'll<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.910> look<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.150> this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
what you'll do is if you look at this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.320 
what you'll do is if you look at this
necklace<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:48.010> see<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.850> ribbon<00:02:49.120> is

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
necklace you can see that the ribbon is

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.720 
necklace you can see that the ribbon is
passing<00:02:49.750> through<00:02:49.900> both<00:02:50.220> over<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.550> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
passing through both over here is the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.300 
passing through both over here is the
fold<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> cut<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> long<00:02:53.410> piece<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.680> ribbon<00:02:53.950> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
fold so I cut a long piece of ribbon and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.100 
fold so I cut a long piece of ribbon and
put<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.640> center<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.360> here<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.810> jump

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
put the center of it here at this jump

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.620 
put the center of it here at this jump
ring<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:57.340> let<00:02:57.610> me<00:02:57.670> untie<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.480> can

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
ring then let me untie this so you can

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.660 
ring then let me untie this so you can
see<00:02:58.810> what's<00:02:58.990> behind<00:02:59.170> this<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.520> regular

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
see what's behind this is just a regular

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.710 
see what's behind this is just a regular
bow<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:02.200> I've<00:03:02.320> passed<00:03:03.130> my<00:03:03.430> wire<00:03:03.670> through<00:03:04.210> one

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
bow but I've passed my wire through one

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.840 
bow but I've passed my wire through one
it<00:03:04.960> or<00:03:05.230> not<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> wire<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.980> ribbon<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.490> passed

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
through one end here like this and then

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.060 
through one end here like this and then
you<00:03:11.980> can<00:03:12.130> tie<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.340> together<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.920> a

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
you can tie it together and this is a

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.699 
you can tie it together and this is a
really<00:03:15.250> pretty<00:03:15.490> special<00:03:16.000> occasion<00:03:16.450> look

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
really pretty special occasion look

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.020 
really pretty special occasion look
because<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.770> can<00:03:18.100> tie<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.580> side<00:03:18.790> or

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
because you can tie it at the side or

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.150 
because you can tie it at the side or
you<00:03:19.060> can<00:03:19.270> tie<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.480> at<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.720> back<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:20.920> tie

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
you can tie it at the back you just tie

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640 
you can tie it at the back you just tie
your<00:03:21.310> basic<00:03:21.640> bow<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.270> I<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.200> use<00:03:23.320> satin

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
your basic bow and I like to use satin

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.990 
your basic bow and I like to use satin
ribbon<00:03:23.890> for<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.760> very

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
ribbon for this because it's very

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.930 
ribbon for this because it's very
forgiving<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.100> even<00:03:27.340> iron<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:27.820> if

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
forgiving and it you can even iron it if

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.480 
forgiving and it you can even iron it if
you<00:03:28.060> need<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.380> looks<00:03:29.560> pretty<00:03:29.770> on<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
you need to so that looks pretty on the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.580 
you need to so that looks pretty on the
side<00:03:30.700> there<00:03:31.030> now<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.840> could<00:03:32.080> also<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
side there now you could also do the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.890 
side there now you could also do the
same<00:03:32.800> effect<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.490> necklace<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.300> made

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
same effect on a necklace that is made

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.949 
same effect on a necklace that is made
with<00:03:35.040> linked<00:03:36.040> pins<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.690> chain<00:03:37.930> that

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
with linked pins so this is a chain that

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.380 
with linked pins so this is a chain that
I<00:03:38.170> created<00:03:38.560> with<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.920> beads<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.520> then<00:03:40.060> here

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
I created with the beads and then here

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.510 
I created with the beads and then here
are<00:03:40.600> my<00:03:40.870> dangles<00:03:41.530> at<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.739> front<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.340> the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
are my dangles at the front and it's the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.250 
are my dangles at the front and it's the
same<00:03:42.730> concept<00:03:42.940> there's<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.570> big<00:03:43.810> jump<00:03:44.050> ring

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
same concept there's a big jump ring

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.110 
same concept there's a big jump ring
here<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.709> side<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.520> if<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.880> wanted

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
here on the side so if you just wanted

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.910 
here on the side so if you just wanted
to<00:03:46.180> create<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.630> tied<00:03:46.870> effect<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.590> could<00:03:47.770> tie

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
to create this tied effect you could tie

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.860 
to create this tied effect you could tie
a<00:03:47.950> bow<00:03:48.190> right<00:03:48.370> here<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> side<00:03:49.180> or<00:03:49.510> you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
a bow right here on the side or you

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.150 
a bow right here on the side or you
could<00:03:50.020> tie<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> little<00:03:50.350> knot<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.830> just<00:03:51.010> add<00:03:51.130> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
could tie a little knot and just add a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.680 
could tie a little knot and just add a
little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.640> ribbon<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.000> it's<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.330> fun<00:03:52.570> to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
jewelry now let me show you one more way

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.060 
jewelry now let me show you one more way
to<00:03:56.380> attach<00:03:56.860> with<00:03:57.610> tying<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.290> another

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
to attach with tying so this is another

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.620 
to attach with tying so this is another
piece<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.489> chain<00:04:00.700> that<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:00.910> already<00:04:01.120> started

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
piece of chain that I already started

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.210 
piece of chain that I already started
with<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> beads<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.470> use<00:04:02.590> some<00:04:02.800> larger

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
with the beads and I use some larger

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.490 
with the beads and I use some larger
beads<00:04:03.430> here<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.000> some<00:04:04.390> bigger<00:04:04.660> funkier<00:04:05.200> chain

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
beads here and some bigger funkier chain

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.140 
beads here and some bigger funkier chain
so<00:04:05.860> this<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.100> gonna<00:04:06.220> make<00:04:06.489> even<00:04:07.030> bigger

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
so this is gonna make even bigger

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.900 
so this is gonna make even bigger
statement<00:04:07.830> what<00:04:08.830> you'll<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.100> with<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.520> is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
statement what you'll do with this is

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
use some leather cord to the side so to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.140 
use some leather cord to the side so to
attach<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.440> just<00:04:14.709> fold<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.220> through<00:04:15.489> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.449 
attach it you just fold it through the
last<00:04:16.359> link<00:04:16.660> on<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> chain<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:17.980> little<00:04:18.310> bit

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
last link on the chain with a little bit

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.960 
last link on the chain with a little bit
of<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:19.060> leather<00:04:19.299> extending<00:04:20.109> like<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.039> okay

of round leather cord and make a spiral
knot

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
knot

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.020 
knot
to<00:04:27.290> do<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.889> can<00:04:28.040> lay<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.400> across<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
to do that you can lay it across the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.439 
to do that you can lay it across the
leather<00:04:29.240> cords<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:31.280> wrap<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.210> around

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
leather cords and then wrap it around

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.379 
leather cords and then wrap it around
and<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.710> coordinated<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> leather<00:04:34.669> with<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
and I coordinated the leather with the

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.969 
and I coordinated the leather with the
beads<00:04:35.600> because<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.050> think<00:04:36.199> that's<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.680> really

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.689 
colors and the beads are so fun and
colorful<00:04:41.539> that<00:04:42.199> you<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.530> reinforce<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:43.280> by

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
colorful that you can reinforce that by

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.670 
colorful that you can reinforce that by
using<00:04:43.970> colorful<00:04:44.509> stringing<00:04:45.020> materials<00:04:45.500> as

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.219 
and then pull and see I'm tightening it
down<00:05:10.160> now<00:05:11.150> what<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.419> could<00:05:11.539> do<00:05:11.720> is<00:05:11.960> put<00:05:12.199> a

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
then slide the knot on top of it then

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.420 
then slide the knot on top of it then
what<00:05:17.510> you'll<00:05:17.630> do<00:05:17.750> is<00:05:17.990> trim<00:05:18.289> these<00:05:18.470> ends<00:05:18.919> you
