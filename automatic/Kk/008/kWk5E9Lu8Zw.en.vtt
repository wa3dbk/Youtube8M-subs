00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
fluoroscope and now what I simply do is

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.500 
fluoroscope and now what I simply do is
I<00:01:32.660> hit<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.840> image<00:01:33.520> button

comes with is what's called a closed
focus<00:01:43.860> probe<00:01:44.130> second<00:01:44.940> I<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.540> focus<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.080> very

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
focus probe second I can focus in very

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.670 
focus probe second I can focus in very
closely<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:48.690> an<00:01:48.870> item<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.410> just<00:01:49.530> going
