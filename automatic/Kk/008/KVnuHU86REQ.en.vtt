00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 It was a good day, I just thought it was skateboarding. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.529
 basketball creator swims examiner 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.160
 disease to which we will make a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.330
 maneuver that is to balance if we like 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 on the two ends of the foot bill up here 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 kan already we have done the heel 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 without fear and now both hands 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.939
 I want you to learn this by holding 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 Something to learn the positions 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.769
 until we start in position five 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 normal wheels never both legs 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.440
 flexed and pay attention back here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.469
 This party does not have to be near you. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.010
 have to make it stand up like a ballet 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 here behind then closing tight 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 here and this continues all the time when 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 you get up will get 50% of your 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.039
 weight here and if you open it will not 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.860
 it will be no good 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.690
 Who then closed behind you? 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.969
 get in the way it bothers to stay 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.729
 lifting the heel here you close 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.030
 so you raise and raise even one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.950
 The two agendas are 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.210
 concerned are no longer fully 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.680
 be careful with this one stay 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.950
 pressed but the part opposite the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.770
 knee does not pass the toe it is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 a little bit behind if it passes in the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.090
 television is exactly to do 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.969
 So this one up ahead does not lift 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.689
 heel but this part of the gift Pedro 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:40.110
 not go ahead 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.110
 then five wheels of law and raising 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.299
 wheels 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.020
 considering this does not feel right 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.719
 balanced cmas 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.000
 the two children because the Brazilian is 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.619
 When you get ahead you can 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.380
 also do exactly the same as 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.129
 back five wheels on his back while 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.190
 He sang and when he raises is that 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.430
 White wants to take care of the house and crazy suit 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.069
 in front you stay well with the ruler 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.040
 cup as I put it in that position 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.989
 ok you too when we get to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.950
 front and dogs that can be done 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.769
 combination with transitions here making the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.459
 transition with the same leg in 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.680
 front can then be mixed with the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.540
 heel and a deficit that this position 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.970
 of wheat can do well 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.769
 information can also be provided with 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.989
 a friend who is making a move 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.079
 that one learns best 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.489
 so we hope that helped and 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.260
 you like the video please 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.239

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 As a base practice I want to see and 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.620

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.620
 lights up, see you soon
