00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
piece here soon enough so let's try them

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
piece here soon enough so let's try them
on<00:02:02.540> put<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.810> stuff<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:04.560> basically

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
on put all this stuff on we're basically
