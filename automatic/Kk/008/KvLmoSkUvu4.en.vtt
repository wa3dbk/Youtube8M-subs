00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.100
 It will be a mere airport of one thousand hectares located between Barranquilla and 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.029
 Cartagena that will demand a private investment of 400 million dollars in 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.170
 its first stage and a thousand 200 million in the second to measure the impact of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.689
 project we invite expert analysts the summation would give more than 25 flights 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.249
 newspapers to bogotÃ¡ 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:19.980
 that is, we are talking 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 of an airlift with a flight of less than one hour each 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 there would be direct flights to new york one or two dailies there would be direct flight to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.199
 mouth 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.360
 2 other in amaya daily flight min 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.350
 s in that sense 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.600
 newscast 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 necessarily it will be necessary to fortify the ways 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.060
 is to say that you square the day we see from the cordiality of the clear 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.470
 on the road to the sea 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.910
 will not generate multiple opportunities for small populations 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.780
 that will be bedroom and will have development will be bedroom of all the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.480
 staff that works in these areas 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.860
 it would be ideal 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.830
 if you got mojo ee a railroad branch a and steel port of 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.350
 Cartagena and Barranquilla 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.410
 i will conjugate 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.570
 with the bird with the airport 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.690
 that railroad can also transport passengers 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 the coach cities and the development of the tourist guide the development of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 project will mean a big boost to investment in this area 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270
 with great tourist potential 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.430
 all the urban development of the municipality 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.090
 hotels malls businesses and industries 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.330
 generates labor for 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.440
 for the Chamber of Commerce of Barranquilla 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.880
 in this project the national government must also contribute resources from heaven 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.350
 of Puerto Real and he is going to become a military base by force 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.530
 Colombian 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.469
 by the government 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.320
 and lg 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.190
 the bread that is why today what I would give in return would be the contribution 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.680
 it seems the man project name of the airport 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.470
 an initiative like these as well as ongoing projects such as doubles 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.260
 the investment in tourism that comes from the initiative 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.230
 or the commuter train is a challenge for the universities of the region and the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.220
 leadership to have puma capital ready what is needed in such a way 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.459
 that the professionals and technicians of the Caribbean are those who are hired to 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.110
