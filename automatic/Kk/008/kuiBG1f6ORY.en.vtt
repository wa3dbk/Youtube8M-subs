00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
less horsepower 250 what does that mean

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.479 
less horsepower 250 what does that mean
to<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> means<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to you what that means to you is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
to you what that means to you is
acceleration<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.300> zero<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> 60<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.649> vehicle

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
acceleration was zero to 60 this vehicle

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
acceleration was zero to 60 this vehicle
zero<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> 60<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:53.969> nine<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
zero to 60 in about nine or the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.160 
zero to 60 in about nine or the
Highlander<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:55.860> eight<00:00:56.100> seconds<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
Highlander is about eight seconds the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.420 
Highlander is about eight seconds the
behind<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> pilot<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.620> about<00:00:58.680> nine<00:00:58.949> seconds

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
behind the pilot is about nine seconds

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000 
behind the pilot is about nine seconds
so<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> second<00:01:00.120> worth<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.420> time<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.199> massive

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so a second worth of time can be massive

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.390 
so a second worth of time can be massive
in<00:01:02.129> getting<00:01:02.879> into<00:01:03.030> traffic<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.899> merging<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
in getting into traffic or merging so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440 
in getting into traffic or merging so
what<00:01:05.519> highlander<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
what highlander is going to be in that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
what highlander is going to be in that
space<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.930> needs<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> Honda<00:01:07.920> pilots<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.400> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
space it needs to be Honda pilots can be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.740 
space it needs to be Honda pilots can be
way<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.090> behind<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.540> Mack<00:01:09.720> truck

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
way back there behind the Mack truck

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.550 
way back there behind the Mack truck
okay

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
okay

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
okay
let's<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.159> around<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.520> side<00:01:11.640> okay<00:01:12.330> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
let's go around the other side okay on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.770 
let's go around the other side okay on
the<00:01:13.409> side<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:13.890> braking<00:01:14.159> system<00:01:14.780> braking

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the side of your braking system braking

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
the side of your braking system braking
is<00:01:15.869> also<00:01:16.170> important<00:01:16.619> too<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> mean<00:01:17.460> by

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
is also important too so what I mean by

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
is also important too so what I mean by
braking<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.330> I've<00:01:18.960> got<00:01:19.170> big<00:01:19.409> discs<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.950> front

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
braking is I've got big discs up front

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
braking is I've got big discs up front
and<00:01:20.520> let<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> discs<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.479> stop<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and let the discs do they stop you a lot

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
and let the discs do they stop you a lot
shorter<00:01:22.560> than<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> Honda<00:01:23.250> Pilot<00:01:23.280> okay

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
shorter than the Honda Pilot okay

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.469 
shorter than the Honda Pilot okay
what<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> means<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.340> 0-60<00:01:26.970> -<00:01:27.240> zero

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
what that means is is in a 0-60 - zero

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.230 
what that means is is in a 0-60 - zero
stop<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.530> vehicles<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:29.520> Honda<00:01:29.850> Pilot

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
stop and these vehicles your Honda Pilot

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
stop and these vehicles your Honda Pilot
it's<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:31.140> less<00:01:31.470> apt<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.159> stop

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it's going to be a lot less apt to stop

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.359 
it's going to be a lot less apt to stop
it's<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.970> 149<00:01:33.750> feet<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.890> Toyota
