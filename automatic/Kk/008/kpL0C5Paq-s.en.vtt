 hello we are students of the university 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.370
 autonomy of the faculty of 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.270
 dentistry we will present the technique to 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.689
 help later higher 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.000
 [Music] 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.360
 the necessary instruments to perform 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.690
 this technique is a mirror 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.810
 the explorer 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.880

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.080
 charcoal 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.080
 the long needle 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.809
 anesthetic with vaso constrictor in this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.680
 If lidocaine with epinephrine 2% and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.410

 they are atomic to identify are 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.710
 exclusively integral first and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 second molar 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.620
 groove bottom 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.960
 your maxillary speed 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 and the space I tell you maxilla 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 the injection point are the small 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 buildings that are in the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 tuberosity of the maxilla these 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 they are 12 3 centimeters by 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.650
 over the rim or cross to the third 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.300
 molar the patient must have the mouth 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.130
 almost closed to avoid the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.830
 interference from the apophis crown today of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 the mandibular must move the jaw 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 lower towards the special Havana 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 click on the bottom of the lobby just 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.340
 behind the apophis and zygomatic at 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.430
 level of the second molar the needle should 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.800
 be long and it goes back and forth 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.610
 up always in contact with the bone 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.970
 the coal must be at an angle of 45 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 degrees 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.340
 later it will move with a 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.830
 30 degree ambulance 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.830
 to reach the tuberosity of the maxilla 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.180
 one centimeter of the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.650
 cartridge in this case and on the way with 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.099
 2% epinephrine in our patient who 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.719
 you can 55 kilos your maximum dose of 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.719
 cartridges are 10 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.689
 remove the needle from the same angulation 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.689
 with which I enter 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.109
 This technique is indicated in surgeries 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.870
 of soft kilos in simple extractions 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.450
 multiple and surgical in the advancement of 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.520
 tooth hospitals and in surgeries 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.550
 prosthetic 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.340
 advantages is a quick technique and the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.140
 necessity is immediate and profound 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.110
 allows access to surgery of region of 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.780
 molars and maxillary sinus a single technique 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.780
 for the molar region avoiding toxicity 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.050
 impatient disadvantages of vehicles is 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.540
 complicated to identify repairs 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.600
 anatomical and you also run the risk 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.830
 of complications since the structures 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.030
 vascular and nervous are in the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.030
 maxillary interior space 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.690
 may be the risk of structures 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 vascular how to help tÃ©lam sharpen 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.910
 internal and flexo - another video 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.630
 causing hemorrhage in space and you 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.610
 I say muscular venous sinus thrombosis 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:11.100
 porn from Arauca and there may also be 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.100
 externally attributed muscle injury
