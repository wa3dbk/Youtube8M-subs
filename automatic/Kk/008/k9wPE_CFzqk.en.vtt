00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hi, I'm back and as you see today I'm in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.240
 Devil 3 who came out a few weeks ago and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.790
 I come with the witch doctor's guide to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 do ps and is there is to do the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 maximum of possible ps and especially in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.230
 voices in bosses 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 because it does a lot of damage to a single 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.870
 objective 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 I have applied a method that is the one I follow 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.610
 in all the games that is read me what 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.430
 all study me everything and look what is 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 what hits the strongest so we're going to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 start as you see this is the tab 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.260
 skills and let's first choose from 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480
 all the primary skill of the click 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.580
 left the skill we choose 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 here is a skill that does damage 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.960
 quite high and you do not give camera 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.620
 the steering wheel is going to go up very little 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.170
 little and that skill is late poisoned 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 with the chip route so we're going 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.789
 to accept 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 we have a skill that does not consume 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.350
 mana and now let's catch a skill 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.600
 that your sister is going to consume us 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.820
 to be the fire bat 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.159
 here you will tell me that a little saying it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 of maximum ps because the bat 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.070
 Predators 280 percent damage 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.340
 but it gives you one goal and in all 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 the voices in all there are areas so it's 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.220
 better to catch the immense bat and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.649
 we will accept if we will have a bit of 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.470
 air to good now that we have our 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.670
 two main skills we do 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.619
 with the other four that we can choose 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.570
 Well, since the bat is going to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.710
 spend the manna let's take a trip 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.820
 astral so that we recover 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.440
 and for that we have to catch the rune of 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 guest of honor that generates a 15 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.460
 hundred of your hand and now you are going to see 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.430
 how is it used so that when I use all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.250
 my bats are very low mana 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.800
 fast but when I give it to low it 's 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.860
 bring it to do even without moving 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.370
 You see his sister 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.369
 it returns me all the mÃ¡laga 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.909
 now 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.120
 the next skill we will choose 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.950
 will harvest souls and will also serve 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 stability is a bug 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.650
 that increases your intellect 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 and it's a striped whore especially in areas 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.310
 if you are in an area and there is almine 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.599
 minimum of 5 box you use it and you get 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 116 percent for each intelligence 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.140
 and it lasts 30 seconds 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.700
 and with the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:53.040
 one of life or that gives you life you generate 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.040
 life for everyone what 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.470
 and let's accept this means that 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.780
 if you have life in half 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.870
 you get in the middle of a pool you use 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.000
 cures 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.310
 now we have a skill that is a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.459
 buff now the other two also for 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.530
 be a buff to do base per se and the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.810
 which will be the two voodoo you have 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.879
 that be I think that minimum level 40 or 45 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.560
 to be able to do this 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.069
 the first voodoo trance skills that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.400
 increases your attack speed by 20% 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:29.099
 with the support dance route 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.439
 which makes also a 30% increase 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.290
 damage is not only yours is of all 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.110
 allies so this benefits all 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.160
 the world let's accept and the next 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.100
 is the exercise of fetishes 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.400
 that invokes you the fetishes that stick 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.720
 for 20 seconds from that cigar a 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.990
 Rack like throwing a trinquet in the wow 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.090
 and we are going to put 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.180
 the ambush of fetishes that inflicts 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.000
 250 percent the year of weapons 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.340
 we go a burrada 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.260
 and now in passive skills we are going to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:13.100
 go full to dps first of all rip the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.709
 veil increases damage inflicted by 20% and 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.579
 increases 20% of mana cost 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.250
 for 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.560
 that does not affect us so much this 30 of 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.409
 costemar to next passive skill 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.370
 tune with the spirits increases a 20 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:32.939
 percent the maximum and regenerates you 1% 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.349
 and in the last one we are going to put fetishes 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.180
 bodyguards that every time you throw 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.889
 the darts you have 3 percent of 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.230
 probability of invoking a fetish 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.530
 during a minute 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.680
 so let's accept and we already have 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.080
 all our chosen skills 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.320
 what are we going to do with this let's imagine 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.530
 that the blacksmith is a boss because if we 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.940
 we approach and do so we heal and 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.590
 gives us a book that increases the 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.910
 intelligence 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.849
 and here we have to do voodoo trance 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.650
 army of fetishes 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.520
 and it's for pissing 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.520
 the bats 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.410
 then we give you to regenerate the regenerate 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.790
 the manna and we throw darts all the time and 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.790
 basically that is 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.460
 very important there is one thing that I do not know if 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:32.310
 it's exactly like that because it does not put it in 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.680
 no side but yes when you use 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.490
 voodoo trance all those who are inside 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.340
 of the area increases damage by 30% if 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.120
 you first do is voodoo trance and then 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.370
 The efe tics exercise assumes that 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.790
 fetishes that are at your side to them 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.880
 you will increase 30 percent of the damage 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.760
 so you will do a brutal dps I have 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.460
 come to clean press god alone and 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.740
 I'm at level 53 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.689
 and with the bats is that you clean 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.709
 alone the pubes 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:10.729
 the areas and loads with a whole 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:14.419
 public 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.169
 and up to here it has been the tutorial not 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.060
 may l 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.669
 teach it in action because it gives me a lot 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.370
 the one that the devil I do not know because even more 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:28.030
 playing online and could not record it with 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.289
 he frasno I do not know what problem I have but 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.520
 up to here the tutorial 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.439
 I apologize for some who got angry in 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.719
 the previous video that I made devil that 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:43.529
 it was a joke that the girl was jumping 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:47.669
 screaming but good I hope you understand 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:52.110
 the jokes so I do not know how to say 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:56.539
 goodbye with these characters there we are 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.539
 Goodbye and see you until next
