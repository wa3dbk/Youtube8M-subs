to put together a horizontal and

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.320 
to put together a horizontal and
vertical<00:00:35.530> piece<00:00:36.430> but<00:00:36.790> that's<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.239> another

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
vertical piece but that's for another

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.200 
vertical piece but that's for another
video<00:00:37.750> so<00:00:38.680> now<00:00:38.860> that<00:00:38.920> we're<00:00:39.250> zoomed<00:00:39.549> in<00:00:39.850> I've

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
simple I also did a video about that in

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.020 
simple I also did a video about that in
one<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.600> my<00:01:07.780> other<00:01:07.930> mattress<00:01:08.440> stitch<00:01:09.030> videos

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
one of my other mattress stitch videos

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.360 
one of my other mattress stitch videos
so<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:11.140> know<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.320> can<00:01:11.710> do<00:01:11.890> this

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
so you know you can do this

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.790 
so you know you can do this
but<00:01:12.910> with<00:01:13.120> garter<00:01:13.540> stitch<00:01:13.870> basically<00:01:14.650> what

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
but with garter stitch basically what

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.030 
but with garter stitch basically what
you're<00:01:15.040> doing<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:16.120> duplicate<00:01:16.810> purl<00:01:17.380> stitch

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
you're doing is a duplicate purl stitch

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.480 
you're doing is a duplicate purl stitch
you<00:01:18.760> want<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.150> go<00:01:19.480> in<00:01:19.750> one<00:01:20.080> edge<00:01:20.440> so<00:01:20.980> here<00:01:21.280> is

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
you want to go in one edge so here is

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.930 
you want to go in one edge so here is
your<00:01:21.790> cast-off<00:01:22.480> edge<00:01:23.190> right<00:01:24.190> here<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
your cast-off edge right here and you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.000 
your cast-off edge right here and you
want<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.240> go<00:01:25.360> in<00:01:25.570> be<00:01:25.870> sure<00:01:26.140> you're<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.410> one

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
want to go in be sure you're in one

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.910 
want to go in be sure you're in one
stitch<00:01:27.790> row<00:01:28.210> in<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.560> don't<00:01:29.770> want

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
stitch row in from that you don't want

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.890 
stitch row in from that you don't want
to<00:01:30.010> use<00:01:30.190> your<00:01:30.340> cast-off<00:01:30.880> edge<00:01:31.210> because<00:01:31.690> that's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
to use your cast-off edge because that's

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.230 
to use your cast-off edge because that's
not<00:01:32.140> garter<00:01:32.650> stitch<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.790> ideas<00:01:34.210> that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
not garter stitch and the ideas that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.960 
not garter stitch and the ideas that
we're<00:01:34.659> creating<00:01:34.840> an<00:01:35.290> invisible<00:01:36.010> seam<00:01:36.400> here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
we're creating an invisible seam here

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.360 
we're creating an invisible seam here
for<00:01:37.240> our<00:01:37.330> garter<00:01:37.720> piece<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.980> only<00:01:39.130> reason

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
for our garter piece and the only reason

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.370 
for our garter piece and the only reason
of<00:01:39.610> course<00:01:39.850> I'm<00:01:40.030> using<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.480> contrasting<00:01:41.170> yarn

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
of course I'm using the contrasting yarn

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.790 
of course I'm using the contrasting yarn
is<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.040> can<00:01:42.190> see<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.580> stitches<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.680> I've

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
is so you can see the stitches so I've

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.200 
is so you can see the stitches so I've
done<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> couple<00:01:45.250> here<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.850> come<00:01:46.180> through

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
done a couple here and I come through

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.460 
done a couple here and I come through
and<00:01:46.780> now<00:01:47.290> I'm<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.770> go<00:01:47.979> up<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.490> around

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and now I'm going to go up and around

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.310 
and now I'm going to go up and around
this<00:01:50.470> purl<00:01:51.220> bump<00:01:51.610> or<00:01:51.909> garter<00:01:52.479> bump<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.050> we<00:01:53.170> go

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
this purl bump or garter bump so we go

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.600 
this purl bump or garter bump so we go
down<00:01:53.740> from<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.180> with<00:01:56.080> our<00:01:56.260> tapestry<00:01:56.560> needle

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
down from there with our tapestry needle

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.760 
down from there with our tapestry needle
okay<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.480> pull<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.870> snug<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.440> can<00:02:00.620> see

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
okay we pull that snug and you can see

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.760 
okay we pull that snug and you can see
that's<00:02:01.270> following<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> same<00:02:02.750> stitch<00:02:03.260> pattern

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that's following the same stitch pattern

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.050 
that's following the same stitch pattern
as<00:02:03.980> that<00:02:04.190> purl<00:02:04.550> Bop

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
as that purl Bop

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.139 
as that purl Bop
so<00:02:05.600> we've<00:02:05.780> gone<00:02:05.990> over<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.440> top<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.149> now

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
so we've gone over the top of that now

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.140 
so we've gone over the top of that now
when<00:02:08.600> we<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> other<00:02:09.380> side<00:02:09.940> how<00:02:10.940> did

when we get to the other side how did
the<00:02:11.270> chicken<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> other<00:02:12.380> side<00:02:12.650> out<00:02:13.010> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
the chicken get to the other side out of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.580 
the chicken get to the other side out of
this<00:02:13.370> stitch<00:02:13.730> get<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.330> other<00:02:14.480> side<00:02:14.780> we

our<00:04:22.150> yarn<00:04:22.509> comes<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.169> over<00:04:23.530> this<00:04:23.710> bump

over<00:04:24.610> here<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:26.289> we<00:04:26.440> go<00:04:26.590> back<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.520> same

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
over here so we go back in the same

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.620 
over here so we go back in the same
stitch<00:04:28.419> hopefully<00:04:29.169> not<00:04:29.349> splitting<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:30.630> going

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630
