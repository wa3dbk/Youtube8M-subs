00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.189
 October 

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.170
 today the world how to make a leap forward with a loss for learned 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.600
 this Tuesday 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.939
 a slogan of this type 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.339
 he did not take gloves for that it's another story we immediately 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.560
 because everyone a country full of other brands 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.529
 you choose the one you like 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.810
 so 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 a first trailer 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.800
 start with 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 your perforation in the middle of the 55 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.910
 he will do everything to succeed 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 and then 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.900
 whenever you want 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 perforated pursue 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.850
 wearing the timesheet 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.560
 repositioned what you cut 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.230
 on the drawing that is on the side 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 to stay in continuity 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.520
 see that gives you a border a person and every time you 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 both a motive 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.710
 you put it back on the edge here 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.300
 by paying attention clemenceau 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 it gives something like that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 so once you finish tunis of the ornate 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.360
 and you can find our edge or the other for them to do the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.590
 double the pattern 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 mine feyzin centimeters from there as it gives me in all the two 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.930
 centimeters 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 so I'm going to use the hole puncher again 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.480
 for % 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.300
 the confrontation was delayed 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.450
 right side inside 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.670
 and we have to position but if you see well 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.040
 then small dots anyway much better here and small 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.619
 points wanted to position the small dots that are finally the border 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.160
 over a year the pattern inside 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.650
 with his father 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 you can use a little less and this time we position 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.560
 so that the small dots are found in the spaces to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.730
 interior 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 it can of course be 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 but the niches 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 edgar 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.269
 it can be something like that 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 and every time 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.279
 you align the pattern 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.659
 the border on the pattern 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 who's inside watching before the war 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.249
 the truth that it's a little bit long 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.949
 but I can not see 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.279
 a very pretty 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.599
 a nice ribbon homeland 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.419
 king of pop will cost a lot to think about 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.059
 have fun
