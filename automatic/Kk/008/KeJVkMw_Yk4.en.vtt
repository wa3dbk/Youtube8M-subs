you're using that character in Batman
Arkham<00:01:55.950> seed<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.729> LC<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.600> looks<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.110> good

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
Arkham seed at the LC it looks so good

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.499 
Arkham seed at the LC it looks so good
and<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.159> feels<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and this one feels like that so it is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.830 
and this one feels like that so it is
really<00:02:00.719> good<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.299> such<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> simple

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
really good I do like it such a simple

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.420 
really good I do like it such a simple
character

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
character

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.389 
character
and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.480> literally<00:02:06.900> your<00:02:07.110> palate<00:02:07.440> as<00:02:07.650> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and then literally your palate as you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.350 
and then literally your palate as you
probably<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.880> you're<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.210> want<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
probably know you're going to want to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
probably know you're going to want to
change<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.810> eyes<00:02:09.960> just<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.860> them<00:02:11.009> whyatt

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
change the eyes just do them whyatt

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.860 
change the eyes just do them whyatt
because<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:11.940> stand<00:02:12.300> out<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.720> you're

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
kind of silly at the moment

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
kind of silly at the moment
once<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.260> change<00:02:37.500> everything<00:02:37.890> cow<00:02:38.160> gone<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you've got yourself a character and it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.699 
you've got yourself a character and it
looks<00:02:44.070> alright<00:02:44.220> I've<00:02:44.730> been<00:02:44.850> using<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.709> use

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
looks alright I've been using it and use

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.470 
looks alright I've been using it and use
a<00:02:46.740> martial<00:02:47.160> art<00:02:47.310> on<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.459> I'll<00:02:47.850> add<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
a martial art on it I'll add a little

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.180 
a martial art on it I'll add a little
segment<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.050> little<00:02:49.080> montage<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.100> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
segment a little montage like I do in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.550 
segment a little montage like I do in
most<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> videos<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.260> show<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
most of the videos and just to show you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.710 
most of the videos and just to show you
what<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.860> character<00:02:53.220> looks<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.490> fine<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.690> I

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
what the character looks like fine now I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.180 
what the character looks like fine now I
didn't<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:54.990> into<00:02:55.110> too<00:02:55.230> much<00:02:55.380> detail<00:02:55.740> with<00:02:56.100> this

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
didn't go into too much detail with this

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.500 
didn't go into too much detail with this
one<00:02:56.400> because<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.760> pretty<00:02:57.000> much<00:02:57.120> know<00:02:57.360> what

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
one because you pretty much know what

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.699 
one because you pretty much know what
it's<00:02:57.630> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> look<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.470> want

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it's going to look like and if you want

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's going to look like and if you want
to<00:02:58.800> make<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.070> character<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.730> pretty<00:03:00.030> much

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
to make this character this pretty much

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150 
to make this character this pretty much
just<00:03:00.360> shows<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> how<00:03:00.930> easy<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.770> is<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.010> make

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
just shows you how easy it is to make

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.590 
just shows you how easy it is to make
it's<00:03:02.370> probably<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.700> shortest<00:03:02.880> video<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.390> made

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
it's probably the shortest video of made

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.840 
it's probably the shortest video of made
when<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.990> comes<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> these<00:03:04.410> DC<00:03:04.830> videos<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.490> I
