00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
top off that I've been getting a lot of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.820 
top off that I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.710> it's<00:00:16.710> been

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
questions on so here we go it's been

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439 
questions on so here we go it's been
about<00:00:17.010> four<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.670> half<00:00:17.699> months<00:00:18.029> since<00:00:18.359> my

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
about four and a half months since my

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.509 
about four and a half months since my
last<00:00:18.600> video<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:20.689> what<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
last video and what you can see is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
last video and what you can see is
probably<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> best<00:00:23.789> thing<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.810> manipur<00:00:25.289> o

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
probably the best thing the manipur o

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
probably the best thing the manipur o
are<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> acropora<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.730> definitely<00:00:26.970> see

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
are the acropora you can definitely see

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140 
are the acropora you can definitely see
a<00:00:27.449> huge<00:00:27.779> amount<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> growth<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.529> both<00:00:29.090> all<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
a huge amount of growth on both all the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
a huge amount of growth on both all the
corals<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.750> responded<00:00:31.170> well<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.920> Cree

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
corals are responded well to the Cree

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.819 
corals are responded well to the Cree
LEDs<00:00:32.219> had<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:34.559> move<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.890> couple<00:00:36.230> candy<00:00:37.230> tree<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
LEDs had to move a couple candy tree and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.069 
LEDs had to move a couple candy tree and
a<00:00:37.920> brain<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.940> weren't<00:00:39.090> reacting<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
a brain they weren't reacting well but I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.709 
a brain they weren't reacting well but I
think<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.559> mostly<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:41.040> being<00:00:41.309> impatient

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
think that was mostly me being impatient

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.740 
think that was mostly me being impatient
all<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> ones<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.350> were<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.829> having

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
all the ones that were kind of having

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
all the ones that were kind of having
reactions<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> brighter<00:00:46.260> lights<00:00:46.590> have

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
reactions to the brighter lights have

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.350 
reactions to the brighter lights have
all<00:00:48.020> recovered<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.200> are<00:00:49.410> doing<00:00:49.620> great<00:00:50.360> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
all recovered and now are doing great so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
all recovered and now are doing great so
so<00:00:52.320> far<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.590> good<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.219> mean<00:00:53.430> there's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> couple

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so far so good I mean there's a couple

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
so far so good I mean there's a couple
things<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.320> example<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.039> club<00:00:57.440> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
things like for example the club the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
things like for example the club the
plants<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> put<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> tank<00:01:00.559> helmetta

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
plants that I put in the tank helmetta

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.090 
plants that I put in the tank helmetta
is<00:01:02.780> here's<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.170> piece<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.920> about

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
is here's just one piece it was about

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
is here's just one piece it was about
half<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.400> size<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.900> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
half that size when I put in actually if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
half that size when I put in actually if
I<00:01:07.049> go<00:01:07.229> around<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> side<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> tank<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> had

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I go around the side of the tank I had

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
I go around the side of the tank I had
to<00:01:08.460> break<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:08.939> recently<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.890> was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
to break it off recently because it was

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
to break it off recently because it was
growing<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.260> taking<00:01:13.830> over

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
growing so much that it was taking over

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.870 
growing so much that it was taking over
so<00:01:14.930> huge<00:01:15.930> amounts<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.350> growth<00:01:16.880> everything

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so huge amounts of growth everything

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.580 
so huge amounts of growth everything
which<00:01:18.060> seems<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.540> responding<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:21.590> record

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
which seems to be responding well record

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.399 
which seems to be responding well record
iya<00:01:22.710> mushrooms<00:01:23.659> both<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:25.049> well<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
iya mushrooms both are doing well in

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
iya mushrooms both are doing well in
here<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.159> polyps<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:27.060> expanded<00:01:27.659> taking

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
here the polyps have expanded taking

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
here the polyps have expanded taking
over<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.380> rock<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> move<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.570> things

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
over that rock and move some things

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230 
over that rock and move some things
around<00:01:30.869> since<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> last<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.240> pretty

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
around since the last one but pretty

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
around since the last one but pretty
much<00:01:33.470> everything's<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.829> before<00:01:34.979> still

glaxy in the back so
if<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.940> lift<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.210> up<00:01:49.330> see<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:52.710> singing<00:01:53.710> Creed

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
if I lift this up see that singing Creed

if I lift this up see that singing Creed
set<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.820> did<00:01:55.210> reduce<00:01:55.510> it<00:01:55.690> down<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.930> about<00:01:56.700> half

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
set I did reduce it down to about half

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.760 
set I did reduce it down to about half
of<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.390> voltage<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.820> was<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.560> pretty<00:02:02.560> darn

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
of the voltage it was a pretty darn

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.859 
of the voltage it was a pretty darn
bright<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.509> everything<00:02:04.509> seems<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> be

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
bright and the everything seems to be

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.870 
bright and the everything seems to be
reacting<00:02:05.380> better<00:02:05.560> think<00:02:06.399> of<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:06.640> I've<00:02:06.700> on

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
reacting better think of that I've on

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.670 
reacting better think of that I've on
right<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:07.450> at<00:02:07.690> six<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:10.140> anyways<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> auto

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
right now at six so anyways for the auto

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.510 
right now at six so anyways for the auto
top<00:02:11.980> off<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.340> went<00:02:12.459> LED<00:02:12.700> tenzie<00:02:13.530> 3155<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.340> is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
top off I went LED tenzie 3155 this is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.390 
top off I went LED tenzie 3155 this is
the<00:02:15.640> oceanic<00:02:16.180> chiller<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.660> 110<00:02:17.050> chiller<00:02:17.400> but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the oceanic chiller to 110 chiller but

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.949 
the oceanic chiller to 110 chiller but
basically<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.030> did<00:02:19.180> was<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.390> five<00:02:19.660> gallon

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
basically all I did was a five gallon

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.910 
basically all I did was a five gallon
bucket<00:02:20.380> drilled<00:02:20.890> some<00:02:21.010> holes<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.550> side

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
bucket drilled some holes on the side

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.040 
bucket drilled some holes on the side
you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.070> in<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.820> pump<00:02:25.600> from<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
you can see in there the pump from the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.530 
you can see in there the pump from the
ton<00:02:26.230> Z<00:02:27.480> there's<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.690> ton<00:02:28.870> z<00:02:29.050> unit<00:02:29.380> that's<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
ton Z there's the ton z unit that's the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.220 
ton Z there's the ton z unit that's the
cost<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> aqua<00:02:32.170> controller<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.989> kind<00:02:35.200> of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
cost of the aqua controller it kind of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.540 
cost of the aqua controller it kind of
gives<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.500> some<00:02:35.650> water<00:02:35.800> parameters<00:02:36.040> right

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
gives you some water parameters right

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.259 
gives you some water parameters right
there<00:02:36.760> right<00:02:36.910> now<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:39.489> pump<00:02:39.760> shoots<00:02:40.090> water

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
there right now so the pump shoots water

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.290 
there right now so the pump shoots water

up here at the top of the biocube see

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.009 
up here at the top of the biocube see
there's<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> float<00:02:43.900> valve<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.840> also

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
there's the float valve and this is also

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.110 
there's the float valve and this is also
the<00:02:47.170> return<00:02:47.650> right<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.580> chiller

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the return right here for the chiller

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.390 
the return right here for the chiller
and<00:02:49.420> cake<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.560> over<00:02:50.800> here<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.160> first

and<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:03.340> last<00:03:03.549> question<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.090> seems<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.510> be

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
and the last question that seems to be

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.350 
and the last question that seems to be
asked<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.959> lot<00:03:05.079> is<00:03:05.410> backups<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.030> what<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.239> did

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
asked a lot is backups and so what I did

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.420 
asked a lot is backups and so what I did
was<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:08.049> ended<00:03:08.950> up<00:03:09.040> putting<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:11.310> APC<00:03:12.310> 1500<00:03:14.430> see

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
was I ended up putting in a APC 1500 see

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.220 
was I ended up putting in a APC 1500 see
the<00:03:15.910> chillers<00:03:16.239> on<00:03:16.390> right<00:03:16.570> now<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:17.049> kind

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the chillers on right now you can kind

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.780 
the chillers on right now you can kind
of<00:03:17.260> tell<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.769> has<00:03:18.040> that's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
of tell that has that's

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.539 
of tell that has that's
most<00:03:20.450> load<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:20.959> put<00:03:21.140> on<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.409> system<00:03:21.799> it

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
most load that's put on the system it

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.179 
most load that's put on the system it
runs<00:03:22.640> for<00:03:23.540> probably<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.379> to<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.530> couple<00:03:24.709> hours

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
runs for probably up to a couple hours

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.319 
runs for probably up to a couple hours
the<00:03:25.730> power<00:03:25.969> out<00:03:27.280> power<00:03:28.280> only<00:03:28.670> cut<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.120> once

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
the power out power only cut out once

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.589 
the power out power only cut out once
the<00:03:29.510> summer<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.560> was<00:03:30.769> down<00:03:31.010> for<00:03:31.700> about<00:03:32.420> an

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
the summer and it was down for about an

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.809 
the summer and it was down for about an
hour<00:03:32.719> and<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> half<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.530> don't<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:34.609> that

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
hour and a half and I don't think that

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.539 
hour and a half and I don't think that
it<00:03:34.939> got<00:03:35.150> low<00:03:35.659> half<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.560> my<00:03:36.739> battery<00:03:37.159> charge<00:03:37.459> so

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
it got low half of my battery charge so

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.069 
it got low half of my battery charge so
anyways<00:03:42.129> i'll<00:03:43.129> post<00:03:43.670> another<00:03:43.849> video<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.599> a

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
anyways i'll post another video in a

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.289 
anyways i'll post another video in a
couple<00:03:45.439> months<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:45.889> as<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.099> can<00:03:46.189> see<00:03:46.370> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
couple months but as you can see the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.149 
couple months but as you can see the
creasing<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> be<00:03:48.139> working<00:03:48.470> very<00:03:48.500> very<00:03:48.769> well

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
creasing to be working very very well

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.289 
creasing to be working very very well
the<00:03:50.030> temperature<00:03:50.569> has<00:03:50.750> stayed<00:03:51.019> down<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
the temperature has stayed down the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.179 
the temperature has stayed down the
before<00:03:53.299> i<00:03:53.329> put<00:03:53.480> these<00:03:53.599> in<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.290> chiller<00:03:54.950> was

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
before i put these in the chiller was

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.960 
before i put these in the chiller was
coming<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.870> maybe<00:03:56.870> every<00:03:57.430> 15-20<00:03:58.430> minutes

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
coming on maybe every 15-20 minutes

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.050 
coming on maybe every 15-20 minutes
dad's<00:03:59.840> coming<00:04:00.019> on<00:04:00.260> maybe<00:04:00.530> once<00:04:00.829> an<00:04:00.980> hour<00:04:01.099> so

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
dad's coming on maybe once an hour so

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.490 
dad's coming on maybe once an hour so
there's<00:04:02.299> definitely<00:04:02.419> been<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.900> difference<00:04:03.319> in

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
there's definitely been a difference in

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500 
there's definitely been a difference in
that<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.840> i<00:04:06.849> mean<00:04:07.849> just<00:04:08.090> pretty<00:04:08.329> much

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
that and i mean just pretty much

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
that and i mean just pretty much
everything's<00:04:08.959> looking<00:04:09.109> really<00:04:09.290> well<00:04:09.500> had

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
everything's looking really well had

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.319 
everything's looking really well had
zero<00:04:11.019> losses<00:04:12.019> since<00:04:12.379> putting<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.799> in<00:04:13.329> although

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
zero losses since putting it in although

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.909 
zero losses since putting it in although
like<00:04:14.540> i<00:04:14.599> said<00:04:14.870> earlier<00:04:14.900> i<00:04:15.200> did<00:04:15.439> move<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.739> couple

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
like i said earlier i did move a couple

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.849 
like i said earlier i did move a couple
things<00:04:16.190> into<00:04:16.489> another<00:04:16.699> team<00:04:18.849> alright
