00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.680 
I don't know enough about betting but I
think<00:04:54.560> there's<00:04:54.740> an<00:04:54.860> initial<00:04:55.300> idea<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.570> then

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
think there's an initial idea and then

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.000 
think there's an initial idea and then
based<00:04:56.900> on<00:04:57.080> where<00:04:57.260> people<00:04:57.290> are<00:04:57.620> laying<00:04:57.800> their

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
based on where people are laying their

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.440 
based on where people are laying their
money<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.280> think<00:04:58.490> that's<00:04:58.820> how<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.060> changed<00:04:59.300> you

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
money I think that's how it changed you

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.090 
money I think that's how it changed you
know<00:04:59.540> obviously<00:05:00.020> people<00:05:00.410> have<00:05:00.500> taken<00:05:00.680> stock

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
know obviously people have taken stock

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.380 
know obviously people have taken stock

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:15.889 
mentioned eating has this been more or

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.679 
mentioned eating has this been more or
less<00:07:15.949> difficult<00:07:16.789> to<00:07:16.999> make<00:07:17.240> wait<00:07:17.449> for<00:07:17.599> the

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:17.689 
less difficult to make wait for the

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.600 
less difficult to make wait for the
second<00:07:17.990> time<00:07:18.139> now<00:07:18.169> it<00:07:18.649> was<00:07:18.889> it<00:07:19.039> harder<00:07:19.309> to<00:07:19.429> just

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
second time now it was it harder to just

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.549 
second time now it was it harder to just
sort<00:07:19.699> of<00:07:19.789> stay<00:07:20.029> the<00:07:20.209> course<00:07:20.360> in<00:07:20.599> state<00:07:20.869> stays

00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:21.559 
sort of stay the course in state stays

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.889 
sort of stay the course in state stays
smaller<00:07:21.949> or<00:07:22.399> or<00:07:22.759> you<00:07:23.059> know<00:07:23.179> what<00:07:23.479> did<00:07:23.659> it<00:07:23.749> just

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:23.899 
smaller or or you know what did it just

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.239 
smaller or or you know what did it just
make<00:07:24.050> it<00:07:24.139> easier<00:07:24.379> now<00:07:24.529> that<00:07:24.709> your<00:07:24.830> body's
