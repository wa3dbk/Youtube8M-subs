00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
remember what Jack has taught me pulling

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.779 
remember what Jack has taught me pulling
the<00:05:44.509> opposite<00:05:44.869> directions<00:05:45.199> of<00:05:45.499> the<00:05:45.559> fish<00:05:45.789> in

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
the opposite directions of the fish in

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.749 
the opposite directions of the fish in
the<00:05:46.939> rod<00:05:47.119> down<00:05:47.739> give<00:05:48.739> them<00:05:48.919> as<00:05:49.009> much<00:05:49.249> stick<00:05:49.639> as

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
the rod down give them as much stick as

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.159 
the rod down give them as much stick as
I<00:05:49.849> think<00:05:50.839> that<00:05:51.159> rod<00:05:52.159> line<00:05:52.869> leader<00:05:53.869> and

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169
