00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.890 
portray things on the screen that were
just<00:02:42.820> literally<00:02:43.330> impossible<00:02:43.630> before<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:48.900> think

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
just literally impossible before I think

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.940 
just literally impossible before I think
about<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.410> scenes<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.860> time<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:52.950> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
about the scenes all the time and you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.470 
about the scenes all the time and you
know<00:02:54.040> they<00:02:54.370> come<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.790> mosaic<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
know they come in a mosaic and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.090 
know they come in a mosaic and
eventually<00:02:56.110> all<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.440> pieces<00:02:56.620> come<00:02:56.890> together

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
eventually all the pieces come together

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.530 
eventually all the pieces come together
and<00:02:57.550> then<00:02:57.640> there'll<00:02:57.820> be<00:02:57.850> some<00:02:57.910> missing<00:02:58.360> ones

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and then there'll be some missing ones

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.460 
and then there'll be some missing ones
then<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.990> sort<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.200> sit<00:02:59.320> down<00:02:59.350> and

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
then I have to sort of sit down and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.050 
then I have to sort of sit down and
really<00:02:59.709> work<00:02:59.950> hard<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.370> get<00:03:00.490> from<00:03:00.700> point<00:03:00.880> A<00:03:01.030> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
really work hard to get from point A to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:18.180 
really work hard to get from point A to
point<00:03:01.180> B<00:03:15.990> my<00:03:16.990> oldest<00:03:17.530> daughter<00:03:17.680> was<00:03:17.890> born

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
point B my oldest daughter was born

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.630 
point B my oldest daughter was born
during<00:03:18.940> Jedi<00:03:19.690> since<00:03:20.470> then<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.950> slowed<00:03:21.400> down

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
during Jedi since then I slowed down

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.370 
during Jedi since then I slowed down
quite<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.060> bit<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.630> focused<00:03:22.990> more<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.230> my

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
quite a bit and I focused more on my

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.320 
quite a bit and I focused more on my
family<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:24.820> going<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.030> be<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.150> first
