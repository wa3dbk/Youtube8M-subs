00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.670
 we're going to relive the two goals of 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.380
 yesterday of the Argentine selection juana 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.490
 before the strict for what was the 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.950
 performance of alejandro's team 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.289
 sabella in the first time left a lot 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.599
 that want the defensive system from the 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.219
 half of the court back that's why 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.619
 Argentina suffered and we said it the 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.449
 started and suffered a lot before a team 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.699
 Chilean who had the need to leave 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.230
 to look for the match a week very but 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.509
 very complicated to which Claudio lived 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.550
 borghi we already know the painted all 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.980
 what we were commenting on in the previous 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.960
 this decisive match for chile and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.910
 also for Argentina to ratify that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.840
 position at the top of the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.090
 eliminatory taking place and in the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.899
 practice everything that had been elaborating 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.280
 but of course with the individualities that 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.870
 has this team that without any doubt 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.239
 mark the differences at the level of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.250
 South America and also the world that's why 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.730
 It was not going to take long to get the goal of the mess 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.949
 messi 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.949
 look at a tile the hitch that 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.019
 does messi is really amazing clear 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.239
 everything one says practically is 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.829
 redundant but it was in speed 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.070
 do that and change the one from the stick to 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.900
 archer is only 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.840
 and Messi is able to demonstrate it in the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.630
 Argentine selection when so many and I 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.570
 I included objected because messi can not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.240
 be the barcelona good gentlemen here 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.369
 we are in presence before the messi al 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.070
 that absolutely everything comes out and here 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.020
 another one of the individualities 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.150
 Higuain may go unnoticed in 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.970
 some matches but appears twice 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.950
 and a sure goal how important it is 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 to have a man offensively is so 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 trained as gonzalo higuaÃ­n that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.140
 define everything that lies ahead is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.509
 important another of the tools 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.149
 important of this Argentina that ends 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.800
 he showed the cogency also things 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.600
 to detail and keep in mind that 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.640
 will surely go through the analysis of 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.830
 Alejandro Sabella defensive phase in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.840
 the end of the game the startle of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 first time and the end of the game what 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 he could show in goals 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.720
 Chiles luckily for Argentina was 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.490
 about the end and there was practically no 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.950
 more time if you had not 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.289
 complicated the positions we said 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 Argentina important victory because 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.000
 two consecutive ones allow you to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.160
 Uruguay and yesterday against Chile 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 in the elimination tournament heading to 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.210
 Brazil-2014 has 20 Ecuadorian points 17 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.090
 colombia 16 so are venezuela chile 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.670
 look at the uruguay that when this began 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.220
 sequence makes four games and three 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.420
 months nothing more in uruguay commanded in the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.520
 eliminator and today is practically 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.550
 out even in fifth place 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.560
 that would allow a good repechage what 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.660
 true is that there you have the positions 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 most important the evolution of ecuador 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.489
 from Colombia and also from the vinotinto de 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.830
 venezuela for what was then a 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.770
 elimination day that ends with 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.410
 the 2012 season and that we will just have 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.720
 to the Argentine team facing 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.080
 Venezuela on March 22, if 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.080
 we are talking about the 2013 season
