00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.490 
because remember in order to bring it
out<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.390> bring<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.930> first<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.410> he

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
out you have to bring it in first so he

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.180 
out you have to bring it in first so he
doesn't<00:02:21.769> give<00:02:21.860> you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
doesn't give you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.520 
doesn't give you
time<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.460> review<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.080> other<00:02:24.230> one

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
time to review it so the other one

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.750 
time to review it so the other one
actually<00:02:24.770> that's<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> little<00:02:25.550> bit<00:02:25.670> more

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
actually that's but a little bit more

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.090 
actually that's but a little bit more
natural<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.450> much<00:02:26.630> easier<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.290> smoother<00:02:27.920> as

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
natural and much easier and smoother as

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.970 
natural and much easier and smoother as
you<00:02:28.460> okay<00:02:29.000> which<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.720> Maya<00:02:30.440> with<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.770> left

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you okay which is Maya with the left

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.970 
you okay which is Maya with the left
Maya<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.600> then<00:02:33.080> two<00:02:33.470> hip<00:02:33.680> drops

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
Maya the right and then two hip drops

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.400 
Maya the right and then two hip drops
one<00:02:34.460> on<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> left<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> right<00:02:35.600> left

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
one on the left one on the right left

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.700 
one on the left one on the right left
right<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.550> then<00:02:37.820> come<00:02:37.970> up<00:02:38.030> again<00:02:38.390> left<00:02:38.990> right

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
right and then come up again left right

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.820 
right and then come up again left right
left<00:02:40.040> right<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:42.350> almost<00:02:42.470> looks<00:02:42.620> like

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
left right so it almost looks like

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.460 
left right so it almost looks like
stupas<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.460> drops<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.150> eyes<00:02:44.470> honestly

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
stupas and drops to my eyes honestly

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.650 
stupas and drops to my eyes honestly
that's<00:02:45.830> how<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.040> feels<00:02:46.190> like<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> me<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.090> down

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
that's how it feels like to me so down

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.340 
that's how it feels like to me so down
down<00:02:48.290> drop<00:02:48.830> drop<00:02:49.160> up<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:50.150> drop<00:02:50.780> drop

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
down drop drop up up drop drop

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:08.140 
down drop drop up up drop drop
jim-jim<00:02:52.250> drop<00:02:52.760> drop<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:54.340> up<00:03:06.460> so<00:03:07.460> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
jim-jim drop drop up up up so the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150 
jim-jim drop drop up up up so the
transition<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.840> obviously<00:03:09.260> way<00:03:09.620> smoother

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
transition is obviously way smoother

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.580 
transition is obviously way smoother
with<00:03:10.520> this<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.030> drop<00:03:11.300> on<00:03:11.510> each<00:03:11.720> side<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
with this one we drop on each side and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.370 
with this one we drop on each side and
beat<00:03:13.490> is<00:03:13.730> very<00:03:14.030> very<00:03:14.300> common<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:14.990> hopefully

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
beat is very very common so hopefully

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.180 
beat is very very common so hopefully
this<00:03:15.730> combination<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.880> Maya's<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.860> hip<00:03:18.860> drops

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
this combination of Maya's and hip drops

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.340 
this combination of Maya's and hip drops
with<00:03:19.400> sharp<00:03:19.610> edge<00:03:19.760> rocks<00:03:20.000> or<00:03:20.300> also<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:21.260> might

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.110 
with sharp edge rocks or also you might
