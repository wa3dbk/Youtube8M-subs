have to do with tipping the iceberg it
actually<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> stamp<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.700> can

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
actually has to do with a stamp that can

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
actually has to do with a stamp that can
be<00:00:39.000> obtained<00:00:39.329> while<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> iceberg<00:00:40.440> now

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
be obtained while on the iceberg now

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.560 
be obtained while on the iceberg now
this<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.280> called<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> Berg<00:00:41.969> drill<00:00:42.270> stamp

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this one is called the Berg drill stamp

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
this one is called the Berg drill stamp
and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> only<00:00:42.989> way<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and the only way to actually get this is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
and the only way to actually get this is
if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> 30<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> penguins<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
if you have 30 or more penguins on the

iceberg
simultaneously<00:00:47.340> drilling<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.750> means

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
simultaneously drilling now this means

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
simultaneously drilling now this means
you<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> either<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.670> hard<00:00:51.120> hat

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you would have to either have a hard hat

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.420 
you would have to either have a hard hat
or<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> drill<00:00:52.020> itself<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.649> order<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.280> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
or the drill itself in order to get this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
or the drill itself in order to get this
stamp<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.469> been

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
stamp now this one has actually been

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
hosted in Club Penguin history one of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
hosted in Club Penguin history one of
the<00:01:45.270> activities<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.560> listed<00:01:47.040> was

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the activities that they had listed was

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.210 
the activities that they had listed was
tip<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> iceberg<00:01:48.570> now<00:01:49.110> no<00:01:49.530> penguin<00:01:49.920> actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
tip the iceberg now no penguin actually

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
tip the iceberg now no penguin actually
succeeded<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> doing<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.750> still

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
succeeded in doing this but it still

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
succeeded in doing this but it still
does<00:01:52.350> lead<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> point<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> iceberg

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
does lead to the point that the iceberg

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
does lead to the point that the iceberg
is<00:01:54.240> Tibble<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> no<00:01:55.710> idea<00:01:55.740> how<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> do

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
is Tibble we just have no idea how to do

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.870 
is Tibble we just have no idea how to do
it<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> fact<00:01:58.530> number<00:01:58.770> two<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> actually<00:01:59.340> going

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it so fact number two is actually going

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.310 
it so fact number two is actually going
to<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> combination<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:00.930> different

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
to be a combination of two different

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.679 
to be a combination of two different
effects<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> first<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.149> iceberg

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
effects now the first one is the iceberg

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.600 
effects now the first one is the iceberg
is<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> only<00:02:04.140> place<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.710> can't<00:02:05.009> access<00:02:05.399> by

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
is the only place you can't access by

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.429 
is the only place you can't access by
waddling<00:02:06.030> any<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.479> place<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> island

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
waddling any other place on the island

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
waddling any other place on the island
you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> access<00:02:08.250> by<00:02:08.399> waddling<00:02:08.819> however<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you can access by waddling however the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
you can access by waddling however the
iceberg<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> only<00:02:10.440> room<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> can

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
iceberg is the only room that you can

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.010 
iceberg is the only room that you can
access<00:02:11.730> by<00:02:12.120> specifically<00:02:12.599> walk

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
access by specifically walk

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.470 
access by specifically walk
and<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.740> second<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.120> iceberg

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and the second one is that the iceberg

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
and the second one is that the iceberg
is<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> only<00:02:16.020> main<00:02:16.260> room<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.620> Club<00:02:16.830> Penguin

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
is the only main room in Club Penguin

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.380 
is the only main room in Club Penguin
that's<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.460> actually<00:02:17.820> connected<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's not actually connected to the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.820 
that's not actually connected to the
island<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.870> that's<00:02:18.930> pretty<00:02:19.200> much<00:02:19.320> evident

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
island and that's pretty much evident

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.560 
island and that's pretty much evident
when<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:19.950> guys<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.670> actual<00:02:21.000> iceberg

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
when you guys go to the actual iceberg

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.560 
when you guys go to the actual iceberg
it<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.550> quite<00:02:23.550> some<00:02:23.760> distance<00:02:24.120> away<00:02:24.240> from<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
it is quite some distance away from the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.250 
it is quite some distance away from the
actual<00:02:24.840> island<00:02:25.170> itself<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.850> fact<00:02:27.270> number<00:02:27.750> one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
actual island itself so fact number one

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
actual island itself so fact number one
I<00:02:28.500> find<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> most<00:02:29.850> interesting<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
I find to be the most interesting and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
I find to be the most interesting and
that's<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.100> learn<00:02:32.460> more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that's because I like to learn more

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
that's because I like to learn more
about<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.240> history<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.630> Club<00:02:33.930> Penguin<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about the history of Club Penguin so the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
about the history of Club Penguin so the
final<00:02:35.970> fact<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
final fact that I have is that the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.980 
final fact that I have is that the
iceberg<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> only<00:02:39.450> rooms<00:02:39.780> that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
iceberg is one of the only rooms that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.090 
iceberg is one of the only rooms that
have<00:02:40.140> been<00:02:40.290> untouched

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
have been untouched

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.430 
have been untouched
ever<00:02:41.250> since<00:02:41.570> 2008<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.930> believe<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.350> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
ever since 2008 and I believe that it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.560 
ever since 2008 and I believe that it
was<00:02:43.530> renovated<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.700> bit<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.480> make

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
was renovated just a little bit to make

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.870 
was renovated just a little bit to make
it<00:02:45.630> look<00:02:45.720> more<00:02:45.900> updated<00:02:46.500> however<00:02:47.280> there<00:02:47.640> has

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
it look more updated however there has

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.160 
it look more updated however there has
been<00:02:48.090> no<00:02:48.990> other<00:02:50.150> updates<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.570> besides<00:02:52.020> that

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
been no other updates to it besides that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.920 
been no other updates to it besides that
since<00:02:52.620> 2008<00:02:53.520> now<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.180> guys<00:02:54.270> remember<00:02:54.450> back

for<00:02:59.730> Club<00:02:59.970> Penguin<00:03:00.390> they<00:03:01.050> updated<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.800> lot<00:03:02.010> of

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
for Club Penguin they updated a lot of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160 
for Club Penguin they updated a lot of
the<00:03:02.250> rooms<00:03:02.460> however<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.000> iceberg<00:03:03.450> has<00:03:03.870> been

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
the rooms however the iceberg has been

about<00:03:07.140> renovating<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.800> iceberg<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.430> really

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
about renovating the iceberg I really

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.460 
about renovating the iceberg I really
known<00:03:09.060> thin<00:03:09.330> Club<00:03:09.570> Penguin<00:03:09.810> would<00:03:09.960> ever<00:03:10.110> touch

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
known thin Club Penguin would ever touch

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.290 
known thin Club Penguin would ever touch
that<00:03:10.740> room<00:03:10.950> only<00:03:11.610> because<00:03:11.850> there's<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.120> much

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
that room only because there's not much

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.740 
that room only because there's not much
to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.570> with<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.770> could<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.160> wrong<00:03:14.400> but

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
to do with it but I could be wrong but

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.900 
to do with it but I could be wrong but
fact<00:03:15.750> number<00:03:15.960> one<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.440> since<00:03:17.040> 2008<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
fact number one is since 2008 the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.880 
fact number one is since 2008 the
iceberg<00:03:18.330> has<00:03:18.450> remained<00:03:18.780> untouched<00:03:18.990> -<00:03:19.710> any
