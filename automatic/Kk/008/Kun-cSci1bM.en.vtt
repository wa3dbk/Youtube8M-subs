the run he made was that something he

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.010 
the run he made was that something he
probably<00:00:35.760> didn't<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.090> enough<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.780> half

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

where it was less room and sometimes you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.790 
where it was less room and sometimes you
have<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:41.160> patient<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.700> create<00:00:42.030> space<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
have to be patient to create space and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.799
