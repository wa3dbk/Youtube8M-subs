00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.820
 says the car is the most to you 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.050
 like yes and smart board 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:21.199
 bright design and also based on the jerboa 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.890
 up to the tucson principle on and assembly ix 35 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.869
 minutes classmate we can all go then 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 here, too, who did not like too 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.119
 very convenient and myself but switching 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.400
 automatic transmission direct the course of the forward stroke 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.020
 and you don't miss this 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.720
 like so much more 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.370
 look too either to the special 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.000
 there is a car in which sports mode 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.289
 bred separately it goes there below 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
 not always convenient, that is, you teach 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.129
 like our sport 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.129
 plays down here 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.640
 learn it on a diesel car 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.470
 two-liter yes it is not the richest 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.770
 equipment by the way equipment 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.960
 the last balanced let's call 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.690
 2 liters diesel engine 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.510
 177 horsepower 390 newtons torque 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.030
 Well, if we compare this 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 petrol engine 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 then about 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.390
 3 3 and a half liters produces such 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.479
 torsional indicators are able 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.159
 correct thrust on bottoms diesel thrust 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.870
 on bottoms and in this engine applies 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.930
 variable geometry turbine 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.250
 put down that is, stupidity changes your 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.250
 the slope is accordingly made different 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.100
 the spirit of such technology disappears 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.050
 turbo pit that is lack of thrust on very 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.110
 low rpm that is where the car 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.020
 practically does not go at all here such 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.240
 the moment is not but the lack of power too 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.610
 it's not something that doesn't feel right here 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 how would just drive this car for an hour 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.090
 traffic jams do not go a little bit me 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.080
 friend there is such a machine too 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.240
 two-liter diesel that's 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.990
 I rode a little faster let's say 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 here and I really liked the plus again 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 same on the last kia fanfest 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.240
 participated there was a gasoline shower 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.619
 cabin you panoramic roof up with 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.780
 panoramic roof with this here park 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.480
 Assist large here this when we we 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.760
 even if he saw parked and would spend 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.459
 too me lead typewriter our center of the field 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.020
 so say our and showed how she 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.640
 really option itself parks 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.080
 I even have a video on the channel for this 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.050
 about this, too, he shot when only herself 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.489
 there is another manager as if with you not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:40.870
 communicated ran to the back understand not how 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.200
 usually you and we have been doing here this test 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.739
 which is what she first scanned 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.760
 can it fully fit into the opening 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 between cars 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.450
 thereafter she gave back herself 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.220
 it only became there we switched to 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 rear forward speed of 2 most on 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.700
 really you know very cool in 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 this plan, but in general such a thing as 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.300
 would not be so parked with us 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.220
 taken more herringbone park there 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.080
 so how is the euro that is and so the principle of things 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 very interesting the most important thing is that there 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.250
 there is a front parking sensors useful thing 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.570
 all the same in the city especially when 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.550
 where you turn from where I can't see yours 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.440
 far corner of the front of the machine 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.069
 so there is a parking sensor 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.850
 who will tell you 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.650
 where are you going how are you going 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.080
 pay attention to say what and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.110
 large steering wheel that is convenient taxiing 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 there is also a thumbs up and grip and 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.800
 specifically that is how it defines 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.800
 the level of the correct grip steering wheel 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.099
 the dashboard is not overloaded 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.750
 let's say everything you need you can see everything that 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.810
 no need not visible then there is no 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.550
 global so many testimonies 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.530
 all the most necessary speedometer 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.240
 tachometer temperature 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.840
 how much do we have 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.840
 left to drive 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.390
 high landing well I sit far 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.519
 I look what is called very next 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.930
 people for some reason outside when you look at 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.340
 the car seems to be not bad 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.159
 visibility as a blouse is only on 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.930
 actually so if you look from the point 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.030
 The view of security is very competent 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 car made i mean it is a side 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.720
 stand she is at shoulder level then 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.940
 there she is you fully protects the side 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.009
 strikes plus beams applied at the door 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.830
 Well, plus the maximum trim levels already 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.690
 there are 6 pillows 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.360
 front and side shoulder pads 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.990
 safety soft plastics such here 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.460
 such carps are obtained inserts 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.120
 gray plastic go very interesting 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.380
 also the answer is such a titan and beautiful 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.229
 it is clear well, in principle, for example, here 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.030
 rear rack here they are a little in the way 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.009
 visibility but it's like if there 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.740
 try to take back without parking sensors 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.960
 the water supply seat has warmed up the design water 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.570
 they are so well yes it is a beautiful body 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.120
 it turns green a little bit yah it's in 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.590
 this plan, it looks more 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.140
 aggressively more dynamic 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.180
 but the terms of reliability of the machines and has already 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.590
 sold there good years three probably 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.200
 already two and a half better than the end of the tenth 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.840
 years the hero that we have appeared December 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.700
 by the way was innocent that is two with 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.130
 half three years they sold that here 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:29.080
 they are themselves as they are already in the hall 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.700
 in terms of reliability, that is, there is 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.100
 some on them tariq not if weak 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.750
 places in sports cars but in principle 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.910
 if you exploit the car 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.980
 speak out usually 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.620
 hard even then basically the machine 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.480
 reliable that is cossack unreliable 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.360
 engine suspension no questions asked 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.920
 but she did not come here in vain 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.900
 he is now guys come out and we became 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.230
 Yes, that is, you still wanted a mouse like 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.230
 to make 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.550
 the court did not have time in principle we are already 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.540
 pretty much talk 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:04.960
 to the car here that is the weak points of such 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:08.560
 there are no strong cars because 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.410
 if you already know experience 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.240
 this service is near us often I 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.480
 I am in Kiev on a business trip says 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.090
 service guys talk and 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.210
 very heavy car breakdowns 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.830
 it accumulates to them yes and here 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.900
 that's interesting yes that is, it turns out that 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.820
 for 2 year spawn, in principle, still so 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.480
 something global did not find yes 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.910
 that is, there was no example assorted 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.100
 proved to be more reliable than the previous one 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.870
 that is, he has already strengthened the Chinese 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.550
 behind the electromagnet building which 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.340
 connects rear-wheel drive in this regard 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.290
 it has become more reliable in general not his 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.330
 questions disappeared overheating 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.020
 rear axle you case of some 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.580
 slips about two words therefore in this 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.080
 I will go on this issue the car has become 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.400
 become much 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.110
 it is clear yes I do not bush 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.110
 well make a song 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.770
 visibility to position 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.770
 company 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:14.259
 wide rear rack here is a little bit 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:18.019
 prevents the machine was without PDC 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:21.769
 it's hard to see what we have here behind 

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:28.149
 machines hook on the flowerbed or not so in 

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:28.149
 the rest is all cool device
