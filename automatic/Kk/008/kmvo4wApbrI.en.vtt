the flop because let's say you better

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.330 
the flop because let's say you better
hand<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.510> seven<00:02:39.840> eight<00:02:39.959> or<00:02:40.320> eight<00:02:40.709> ten<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
hand like seven eight or eight ten you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.120 
hand like seven eight or eight ten you
know<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> gut<00:02:41.880> shot<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:43.680> 10<00:02:43.860> isn't

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
know like a gut shot that 10 isn't

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.740 
know like a gut shot that 10 isn't
pretty<00:02:44.340> meaty<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.820> Coleman<00:02:45.209> has<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> hand<00:02:45.630> like

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
pretty meaty so Coleman has a hand like

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750 
pretty meaty so Coleman has a hand like
ace<00:02:45.930> queen<00:02:46.260> ace<00:02:46.440> Jack<00:02:46.800> he<00:02:47.040> may<00:02:47.160> decide<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.610> give

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
ace queen ace Jack he may decide to give

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.479 
ace queen ace Jack he may decide to give
up<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.090> where<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.489> paired

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
up now where if it was like a paired

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.340 
up now where if it was like a paired
board<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:51.030> something<00:02:51.239> might<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.049> be<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.230> good

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
board or something might not be as good

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.009 
board or something might not be as good
a<00:02:52.410> card<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> bluff<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.540> also<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.989> very

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
a card to bluff at but also it's very

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.479 
a card to bluff at but also it's very
likely<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.410> Jacobson<00:02:55.920> does<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.280> something

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
likely that Jacobson does have something

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.229 
likely that Jacobson does have something
here<00:02:57.590> if<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:58.890> he<00:02:58.920> led<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.340> flop<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.760> also

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
here if he if he led the flop and also

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.610 
here if he if he led the flop and also
bet<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.570> ten

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.050 

this<00:03:05.620> pot<00:03:05.829> feels<00:03:06.129> like<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.489> know<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.610> Coleman

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
this pot feels like you know a Coleman

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.309 
this pot feels like you know a Coleman
might<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> have<00:03:07.510> an<00:03:07.599> overpair<00:03:07.959> here<00:03:08.200> and

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
might just have an overpair here and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.569 
might just have an overpair here and
still<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.769> still<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.129> be<00:03:09.220> playing<00:03:09.459> it

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
still and still just be playing it

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.740 
still and still just be playing it
carefully

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.979 

so<00:03:13.750> for<00:03:14.200> Jacobson<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:15.239> think<00:03:16.239> if<00:03:16.360> he's<00:03:16.510> got<00:03:16.750> like

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
so for Jacobson I think if he's got like

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.170 
so for Jacobson I think if he's got like
just<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.470> nine<00:03:17.680> or<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.640> ten<00:03:18.849> he's<00:03:19.060> gonna

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
just the nine or just a ten he's gonna

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.720 
just the nine or just a ten he's gonna
wave<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.450> white<00:03:19.659> flag<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.109> check<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:21.430> he<00:03:21.579> can

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
wave the white flag and check if he can

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.729 
wave the white flag and check if he can
beat<00:03:21.909> that<00:03:21.939> you<00:03:22.390> should<00:03:23.079> expect<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> see<00:03:23.709> a

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
beat that you should expect to see a

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.900 
beat that you should expect to see a
pretty<00:03:23.799> sizable<00:03:24.400> bet

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.640 

you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.630> Coleman<00:03:31.080> he<00:03:31.170> could<00:03:31.290> hit<00:03:31.470> three

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
you know Coleman he could hit three

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.800 
you know Coleman he could hit three
kings<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.100> it's<00:03:33.030> very<00:03:33.060> possible<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.690> he's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
kings there it's very possible that he's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.140 
kings there it's very possible that he's
got<00:03:33.930> an<00:03:33.990> old<00:03:34.110> repair<00:03:34.380> here<00:03:34.790> took<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
got an old repair here took it to the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.580 
got an old repair here took it to the
ten<00:03:36.330> high<00:03:36.510> board<00:03:36.750> oh<00:03:37.910> he<00:03:38.910> hates<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.360> yeah<00:03:39.630> he

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
ten high board oh he hates it yeah he

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.360 
ten high board oh he hates it yeah he
does<00:03:40.740> have<00:03:40.890> an<00:03:41.040> overpair<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.610> think<00:03:42.350> he<00:03:43.350> called

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.000 

set<00:03:47.370> set<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.060> fours<00:03:48.470> he's<00:03:49.470> high

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
set set of fours he's high

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.360 
set set of fours he's high
okay<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.810> I'll<00:03:52.200> never<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.800> say<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.130> was

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
okay so I'll never have to say that was

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.700 
okay so I'll never have to say that was
warranted<00:03:53.790> Wow<00:03:54.510> quite<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.990> gutsy<00:03:55.230> play<00:03:55.500> from

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
warranted Wow quite a gutsy play from

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.410 
warranted Wow quite a gutsy play from
Jacobson<00:03:56.190> he's<00:03:56.340> certainly<00:03:56.820> capable<00:03:56.910> of

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
Jacobson he's certainly capable of

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.300 
Jacobson he's certainly capable of
making<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.750> big<00:03:57.900> Bluff<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.380> he<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.190> went

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
making a big Bluff and he really went

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.640 
making a big Bluff and he really went
for<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.610> there<00:03:59.850> he<00:03:59.970> probably<00:04:00.120> put<00:04:00.600> Coleman<00:04:01.530> on

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
for it there he probably put Coleman on

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.530 
for it there he probably put Coleman on
an<00:04:01.740> overpair<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.490> did<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.880> thought<00:04:03.420> he

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
an overpair like I did and thought he

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.540 
an overpair like I did and thought he
would<00:04:03.630> throw<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.960> throw<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.140> away<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.280> that's

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
would throw it throw it away and that's

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.930 
would throw it throw it away and that's
it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.870 
it
