00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.960
 show how fashion and with a gta iso 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.380
 so hot swapping must have xbox 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 open that's how it should be then 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 must have a hard drive and a usb key 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.270
 to make you understand 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 Why 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 if you do not have a hard drive 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.769
 you will need usb keys broken 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 my keyboard so here it is crazy and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.680
 a year ago we can see here 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.680
 so then you put in your gta 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.079
 on the other hand a first time you go 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 in system settings yeah I say 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 my English because my city fashion in 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.149
 English so it works better so I 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.020
 in storage is there so I apologize 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.329
 swear I'll put in the disc 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 hard actually there is emptied the cage system 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.550
 case by the way so basically it's going to take off 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.199
 all the updates you have and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700
 if you do not do it without risk of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.500
 curl or not market I do not know but 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 So here we go now 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.979
 proceed then why am I fine 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 in do x fake game details 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.450
 installed all that so we'll go on 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.030
 install make sure your usb key 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.420
 go in never do you see she 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420
 is not in 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 basically it's going to make a station 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.979
 directly to hard drive because 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 normally when you have put the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 usb key to do that this is it going to do its 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.920
 Mom here is here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.689
 So there is going to be our zapping 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.829
 you choose what you want me 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.970
 put it there because I have more than 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.640
 space so since I'm with a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.430
 laptop is extremely difficult 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 so nothing my game cursed verbatim then 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.469
 it takes verbatim dvd + r if really 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.899
 the most because if we take the least 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.490
 it will always be more popular rdl 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.819
 so double layer of 8 500 giga that's 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.869
 dvd + rd so that's going to be very 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.869
 hard I have no way to do 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:21.239
 I do not know if I do it with these 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.239
 I'm here then hop 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.450
 so I'll try to do it from 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.670
 better than I can so finally the row 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 I put the game mode and put the little 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.150
 magnet here so I'll try to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:48.250
 to do it will be very complicated for me 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:49.530
 but now that you can go 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.200
 slowly 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.189
 that's good and you put that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.510
 you are quickly installed and therefore by 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:03.970
 against there my game I do not know if there is 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.769
 something but I hope not I 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.000
 past it's pretty fashionable and the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.340
 striped goods all ages buy gas 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.389
 so here's the ai writing 1% so where you 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.590
 wait until the end not so for 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:27.699
 the moment I'm going to cut the video not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.900
 but wait here you're me I'm going 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.940
 for now I'm going to talk to you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.080
 chain so seynois chain I'm going 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 do I go 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.250
 especially make videos go of course 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.880
 it's going to be with a laptop what will 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.510
 to be boring but videos of gta iv 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:51.320
 modes of funny stuff all that and 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.790
 eybens and then and so here is yeah 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.640
 so to download the games 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.980
 finally the game you put gta iv the flc 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.280
 because I'm sure liberty city 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.840
 so here you are on this pirate bay 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.190
 or you torrent411 favorites have nothing 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.680
 all this so you download the good 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.600
 must be in pal not interested 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.480
 because I suppose you live in 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.220
 france what would be a little logical is 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.120
 so you do not take that so do not take 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.830
 the gta iso and to find modes 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.270
 so be you go on youtube you 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.460
 put modes that so for example 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:36.290
 x mc volume 4 finally version 4 there has been 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.720
 waves 3.0 there are in full or so 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.890
 I'm going to put a link in the 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.630
 description so that in fact I have a 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.330
 forum there really is a lot a lot 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.500
 of things above and frankly well 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.070
 so I think I'm going to cut the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.870
 video and I'm going to make it a very low 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.340
 low sites right after I finished months 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.400
 have been the changes because I have 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.390
 not stay like that without seven years and I 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.480
 will show you when it's over 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.480
 morgues roger do two games here
