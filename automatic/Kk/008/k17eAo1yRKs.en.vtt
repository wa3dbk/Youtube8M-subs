00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
comes up quick and it I mean it looks

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539

like<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> red<00:01:22.290> dot<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
like you got a red dot what I did is I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.050 
like you got a red dot what I did is I
left<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> hood<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:26.369> hood<00:01:26.400> blocks<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> light

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
left the hood the hood blocks the light

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240 
left the hood the hood blocks the light
so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> makes<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.930> shine<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.740> took<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so it makes it not shine so I took a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.670 
so it makes it not shine so I took a
dremel<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.570> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.110> put<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.470> air

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
dremel and just kind of put some air

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.999 
dremel and just kind of put some air
slots<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.049> hood<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
slots there in the hood so that way it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
slots there in the hood so that way it
still<00:01:35.220> has<00:01:35.310> protection<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.000> light<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.450> get

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
still has protection but light can get

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.469 
still has protection but light can get
into<00:01:36.900> make<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> thing<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.829> stand<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.490> so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

them<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.840> right<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> thought<00:02:13.380> they'd<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.850> for

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
them on right I thought they'd be for

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.160 
them on right I thought they'd be for
here<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.870> 25<00:02:16.709> yards<00:02:17.130> I'll<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.240> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
here but 25 yards I'll back up but that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
here but 25 yards I'll back up but that
was<00:02:19.230> nice<00:02:21.050> all<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.390> first<00:02:24.390> thing<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.720> can

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
was nice all right so first thing I can

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.770 
was nice all right so first thing I can
say<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.860> sites<00:02:26.160> are<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.570> hundred<00:02:27.570> percent

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
say is these sites are a hundred percent

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.699 
say is these sites are a hundred percent
improvement<00:02:28.440> over<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.450> factory<00:02:30.709> whatever

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
improvement over the factory whatever

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.800 
improvement over the factory whatever
you<00:02:31.860> call<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.130> barrel<00:02:32.580> mounted<00:02:32.730> sites<00:02:33.270> sucks

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
you call them barrel mounted sites sucks

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.199 
you call them barrel mounted sites sucks
I<00:02:33.959> -<00:02:34.320> still<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:35.010> I'll<00:02:35.670> probably<00:02:35.850> keep<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
I - still on there I'll probably keep it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.760 
I - still on there I'll probably keep it
on<00:02:36.360> there<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.050> my<00:02:37.200> way<00:02:37.410> as<00:02:37.709> a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
on there it's not in my way as a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.630 
on there it's not in my way as a
fail-safe

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.640 

every<00:02:41.640> distance<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.209> have<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> shoot<00:02:43.050> I'm

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
every distance I have here to shoot I'm

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.330 
every distance I have here to shoot I'm
hitting<00:02:44.010> my<00:02:44.130> steel<00:02:44.430> every<00:02:44.760> time<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:46.590> pulled<00:02:47.280> one

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
hitting my steel every time I pulled one

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.600

shot<00:02:47.730> left<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.750> paper<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.370> was<00:02:50.459> my

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
shot left on paper I know it was my

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.910 
shot left on paper I know it was my

pretty happy I somewhat cited in the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.040 
pretty happy I somewhat cited in the
other<00:02:55.980> sites<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.910> had<00:02:57.090> those<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.510> go<00:02:57.660> by<00:02:57.840> when

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
other sites in I had those to go by when

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.780 
other sites in I had those to go by when
I<00:02:58.080> put<00:02:58.320> these<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.980> kind<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.400> knew<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.670> was

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
I put these on I kind of knew it was

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.820 
I put these on I kind of knew it was
going<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.180> close<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.200> didn't<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.590> was

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to be close I didn't know I was

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.860 
going to be close I didn't know I was
going<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.010> nail<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.549> mean<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.269> elevations

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
going to nail it I mean the elevations

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.970 
going to nail it I mean the elevations
dead<00:03:04.110> nuts<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.610> site<00:03:05.880> has<00:03:06.620> has<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> lot<00:03:07.860> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
dead nuts and the site has has a lot of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.590 
dead nuts and the site has has a lot of
elevation<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:11.600> so

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
elevation know if you can see that so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.870 
elevation know if you can see that so
this<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.170> goes<00:03:13.350> back<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.830> forth<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.310> you

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
this this goes back and forth and you

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.729 
this this goes back and forth and you
have<00:03:14.970> quite<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> bit<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.480> elevation<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:16.709> can

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
have quite a bit of elevation you can

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.250 
have quite a bit of elevation you can
move<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.220> peep<00:03:17.430> left<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:19.110> you've

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
move the peep left and right so you've

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.850 
move the peep left and right so you've
got<00:03:19.290> some<00:03:19.410> windage<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:21.049> knew<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.080> had<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.530> move<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
got some windage I knew I had to move it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
got some windage I knew I had to move it
a<00:03:22.920> little<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> right<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> was

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
a little to the right because I was

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.870 
a little to the right because I was
hitting<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> little<00:03:24.299> left<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.250> set<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.700> up

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
hitting a little left so I set it up

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.030 
hitting a little left so I set it up
that<00:03:27.120> way<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.500> happen<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.860> work

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
that way and I just so happen to work

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.920 
that way and I just so happen to work
out<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.850> hit<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> steel<00:03:30.360> as<00:03:30.570> far<00:03:30.750> back

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
out if I can hit the steel as far back

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.380 
out if I can hit the steel as far back
as<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.530> here<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.459> about<00:03:32.640> 45

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
as what I have here and it's about 45

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.320 
as what I have here and it's about 45
yards<00:03:33.890> that's<00:03:34.890> as<00:03:35.250> far<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.640> as<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:35.970> shoot

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
yards that's as far back as I can shoot

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.720 
yards that's as far back as I can shoot
but<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.810> could<00:03:37.019> go<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> little<00:03:37.410> further<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.010> you

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
but I could go a little further but you

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.380 
but I could go a little further but you
know<00:03:38.820> safely<00:03:39.709> but<00:03:40.709> uh<00:03:40.769> yeah<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.640> really<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.239> it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
know safely but uh yeah I really like it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.350 
know safely but uh yeah I really like it
it's<00:03:42.450> gotten<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> tiny<00:03:43.560> bit<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.950> recoil<00:03:44.360> foreign

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
it's gotten a tiny bit of recoil foreign

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.880 
it's gotten a tiny bit of recoil foreign
feels<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.840> little<00:03:45.959> loose<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.500> guess<00:03:46.709> they're

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
feels a little loose but I guess they're

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.340 
feels a little loose but I guess they're
just<00:03:46.920> kind<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.870> but<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:48.989> loose<00:03:49.170> on

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
just kind of like that but it's loose on

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.050 
just kind of like that but it's loose on
my<00:03:49.500> receiver<00:03:49.950> side<00:03:50.280> where<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.670> kind<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> goes

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
my receiver side where it kind of goes

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.600 
my receiver side where it kind of goes
into<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.390> receiver<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.250> I'm<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.579> to
