00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.399
 and there beauty people who is the bruno who 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 dinensino black matter good to play 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.710
 little lehmann this is a little game 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.770
 so ubisoft a very franchise 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 and they decided to adapt 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:22.169
 There's a cost there to see what 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 It happens this game is once I pay 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.230
 I'm guessing the little volume is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 got a planet that will get in the way 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.110
 both $ 99 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.520
 It's a bit expensive because I think 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 that this type of game that opens the 99 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.610
 cents in 2009 a little 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.930
 expensive for him and I'll explain why 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 next it a very simple game is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.880
 just a touch of the screen you will use the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.120
 Thumbs and thumbs to play 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.850
 you have four tap worlds that are being 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.560
 released as phase-to-phase passes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.400
 can not jump from a world by or 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.590
 of the other part 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.090
 For example, you can achieve this 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 amp call 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.309
 you go in phase 1 then to 2 to 3 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.979
 for 4 until finishing 9 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 the 10th stage you only get after that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.719
 Can you collect this stone? 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 has to collect at least five 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.869
 red stones that are the teeth of the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.100
 death, right? 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.289
 then when the sample in at least 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 five teeth opens her phase 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.049
 returning here then the phase front is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 you can only jump in the fai phase beyond 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 of people also fly in the wool or you jump 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 fly up and down the walls and into the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 ask that you do all this but only that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 the opponents already then I will show here 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.569
 in the fly phase a random phase here by 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.780
 example here the phase 6 I could not 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.359
 still will have to say what you got 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.689
 no more happy little pets 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.789
 before anything else the most 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.310
 high that music is a thing that marks 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.389
 very well, the rudder and the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.719
 observed is very beautiful a confused game 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.719
 without detecting it so beautiful that it is 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.170
 opa 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.090
 here the people could not get the whole 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.970
 line did you miss that right? 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.740
 they saw that I flew is the factor that did not 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.740
 I gotta get it but we're going. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680
 Look who likes to meet until I get more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
 nevermind 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.830
 he runs alone it's possible to 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.150
 There is also no 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.420
 change of direction happens when you 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 hits a wall and you turn the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.290
 his position 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.380
 and then see or do is a phase of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.070
 then it's hard to enjoy that 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.760
 took 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.520
 it's enough to catch all 40 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.950
 bugs in missed will not do 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.060
 put here in the punch phase, that's all 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.190
 plus the punch 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.450
 then we spoke here at the stage number 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 yen 2 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:19.670
 just see the right side click here 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:19.670
 I 'm the gay kiss music in the soap opera. 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.190
 this little heart a life that you take 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.280
 but no 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.280
 oops hit once since you already 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:42.750
 dies to see if he does not have the blood type and 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:45.540
 Ball circulation is here and you 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.930
 not only was joy 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.519
 and finally you're 10 a phase 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.610
 that phase of death 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.880
 I managed to release it all is both 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.019
 on day anp on the flyer of the day because it is a 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.180
 A little easier you managed to hit 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.549
 remember here full of courage not to 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.269
 die to make beautiful in the recording by 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:13.829
 least at this stage is basically with the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.250
 Things that have to decorate the game know 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:21.049
 is not a hero of an old dream, right? 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.049
 the motto itself is not common 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.340
 but it 's interesting how you did it is not 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.770
 have to decorate every move because 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.420
 an erradinha does not have that to say that 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.420
 Can not get back in the game, you know. 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.599
 Marie died cruel cruel animal 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.550
 Good, I'm not going to camp too much 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.770
 greater than progress and the final conclusion 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.360
 of the game is worth it or not worth it 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.060
 get the game 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.639
 Look, I'll be very honest with you, I 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.419
 I expected more, this game is a game like that. 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.550
 How did I say, funny, and a graphic? 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.259
 a sound this is a worthwhile game 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.860
 be played on the other hand for being a 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:18.770
 paid and not worth the game is not worth the fact 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.889
 been paid no chance, right price, because I 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.479
 I got to play this game one day - in the day 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.219
 Because I bought in the afternoon at the end of the day. 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.020
 his was getting dark at seven 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.389
 Understanding night of the 47 was already 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.789
 generating logical nodes game was not 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.860
 generating the project with all 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.789
 actively there but I managed to tell the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.469
 all phases is so so is a type 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.349
 game that if you take two days 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:45.020
 direct can do everything in it 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:49.039
 or will not be paid to have you 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.050
 exemption only if for example this 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.550
 business of only releasing the 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.710
 skills of each stage 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.360
 I also think it's not worth it if I 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.240
 has had from the beginning have to give 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.250
 punch has to climb wall joa 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.560
 I think it would have been more fun to 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.110
 exploration of the two phases and photo 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.330
 run alone here I like bitter 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.699
 thus quit the sonic when performing a 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.889
 dream that you give the blood and three that 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.370
 He accelerates alone, you just keep jumping. 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.099
 had not excluded had two or 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:25.669
 three of its own version of 29 which 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:27.979
 I have even those games that only 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.110
 I'll buy it for you as a gift. 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.759
 pile playing, playing alone know 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.069
 If I do not know much about game control 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.830
 so I miss exploring stage 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.690
 back to download at last discovered the 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.150
 to overcome obstacles, perhaps from a 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.819
 way a little more mature game right 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.409
 so this is the final conclusion then 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.719
 I do not think it's worth playing. 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:51.490
 You buy to have it worth to play. 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:54.380
 but not for you to have paid for it 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.849
 was liked expression of confidence that 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.219
 gameplay right 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.169
 and leaves the comments if you that you guys 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:02.330
