this is Dan Seifert with the verge and
we're<00:00:04.529> taking<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> look<00:00:04.980> at<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.279> new<00:00:05.490> Samsung

that<00:00:11.340> Samsung<00:00:11.670> has<00:00:11.820> really<00:00:12.150> never<00:00:12.360> done

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
that Samsung has really never done

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.110 
that Samsung has really never done
before<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.110> its<00:00:13.230> mobile<00:00:13.500> devices<00:00:13.969> it's<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
before with its mobile devices it's a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.900 
before with its mobile devices it's a
complete<00:00:15.719> redesign<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.619> Samsung<00:00:17.220> smartphones

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
complete redesign of Samsung smartphones

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.640 
complete redesign of Samsung smartphones
it<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.210> looks<00:00:18.449> significantly<00:00:19.230> different

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it really looks significantly different

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.340 
it really looks significantly different
than<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> prior<00:00:20.760> Galaxy<00:00:21.270> s5<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.990> galaxy

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
than the prior Galaxy s5 or the galaxy

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
than the prior Galaxy s5 or the galaxy
s4<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.220> galaxy<00:00:23.580> s3<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
s4 the galaxy s3 which all kind of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.179 
s4 the galaxy s3 which all kind of
looked<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.740> one's<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> really

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
looked the same this one's got a really

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.920 
looked the same this one's got a really
unique<00:00:26.400> distinctive<00:00:26.970> design<00:00:27.269> primarily

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
unique distinctive design primarily

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
unique distinctive design primarily
that's<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> front<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.160> rear

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that's because it's a front and rear

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
that's because it's a front and rear
glass<00:00:29.820> panels<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> Gorilla<00:00:31.380> Glass<00:00:31.529> 4

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
glass panels so it's a Gorilla Glass 4

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
glass panels so it's a Gorilla Glass 4
on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> front<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> back<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
on the front and the back and then it's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
on the front and the back and then it's
got<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.110> metal<00:00:34.380> border<00:00:34.920> around<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
got this metal border around it this

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
got this metal border around it this
metal<00:00:36.300> frame<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> continuation<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
metal frame it's a continuation of the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
metal frame it's a continuation of the
design<00:00:38.850> elements<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.510> we've<00:00:39.660> seen<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
design elements that we've seen on the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.369 
design elements that we've seen on the
note<00:00:40.620> 4<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> Galaxy<00:00:42.750> alpha<00:00:42.870> from<00:00:43.170> last

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
note 4 and the Galaxy alpha from last

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
note 4 and the Galaxy alpha from last
year<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.340> taken<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> new<00:00:44.910> level<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
year but it's taken to a new level it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.200 
year but it's taken to a new level it
really<00:00:45.660> does<00:00:45.840> look<00:00:45.870> quite<00:00:46.410> premium<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.940> much

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
really does look quite premium and much

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
really does look quite premium and much
better<00:00:48.450> than<00:00:48.690> Samsung's<00:00:49.200> earlier<00:00:49.590> efforts<00:00:50.100> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
better than Samsung's earlier efforts as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
better than Samsung's earlier efforts as
you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> galaxy<00:00:51.600> s6<00:00:52.050> edge<00:00:52.289> has

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you can see here the galaxy s6 edge has

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
you can see here the galaxy s6 edge has
a<00:00:52.680> curvature<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.059> both<00:00:54.239> sides<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
a curvature to it it's on both sides of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
a curvature to it it's on both sides of
the<00:00:54.809> glass<00:00:55.100> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> front<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the glass for the front here which is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
the glass for the front here which is
different<00:00:57.870> than<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> note<00:00:58.230> edge<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:58.829> only

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
different than the note edge which only

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
different than the note edge which only
curved<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.579> side<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.600> doesn't<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
curved on one side it doesn't really

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
curved on one side it doesn't really
have<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> different<00:01:01.770> display<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> sides

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
have a different display on the sides

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
have a different display on the sides
like<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> note<00:01:03.570> edge<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.110> still<00:01:04.530> using<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
like the note edge it's still using the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
like the note edge it's still using the
same<00:01:04.920> display<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.729> mostly<00:01:06.000> designed<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
same display and it's mostly designed to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
same display and it's mostly designed to
make<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> easier<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> swipe<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.640> side

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
make it easier to swipe in from the side

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.929 
make it easier to swipe in from the side
as<00:01:09.689> opposed<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> run<00:01:10.470> specific<00:01:11.040> apps<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.790> the

as opposed to run specific apps like the
