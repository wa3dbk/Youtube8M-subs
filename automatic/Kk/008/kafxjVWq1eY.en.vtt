decibels which I believe is a little bit

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
decibels which I believe is a little bit
more<00:01:11.310> than<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> standard<00:01:12.200> Siberia<00:01:13.200> headset

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
more than the standard Siberia headset

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
more than the standard Siberia headset
but<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.760> video<00:01:15.299> covering<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.409> of

but we do have a video covering all of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.859 
but we do have a video covering all of
the<00:01:16.650> rest<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> Siberia<00:01:17.970> version<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:18.540> so

the rest of the Siberia version too so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
the rest of the Siberia version too so
you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> check<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.280> to

you can check that out if you want to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.690 
you can check that out if you want to
compare<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> frequency<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.130> these<00:01:23.430> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
compare now the frequency on these is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
compare now the frequency on these is
eighteen<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.509> twenty<00:01:25.170> excuse<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:25.979> eighteen<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
eighteen to twenty excuse me eighteen to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
eighteen to twenty excuse me eighteen to
twenty<00:01:26.729> eight<00:01:26.759> thousand<00:01:27.390> Hertz<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.259> has

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
twenty eight thousand Hertz and it has

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.719 
twenty eight thousand Hertz and it has
an<00:01:28.650> impedance<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.400> 32<00:01:29.970> ohms<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.570> an<00:01:30.750> SPL<00:01:31.350> of

an impedance of 32 ohms and an SPL of
108<00:01:32.729> decibels<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:34.680> let's<00:01:35.100> move<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
108 decibels so now let's move on and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.160 
108 decibels so now let's move on and
take<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> accessories<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.079> I'll
