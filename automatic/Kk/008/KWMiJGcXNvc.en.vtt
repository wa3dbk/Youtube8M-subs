00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
in game and that is actually fully

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.860 
in game and that is actually fully
textured<00:03:04.700> anyway<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.849> next<00:03:05.940> two<00:03:06.180> items<00:03:06.390> are

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
textured anyway the next two items are

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.809 
textured anyway the next two items are
both<00:03:07.079> for<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.349> mercenary<00:03:07.560> red<00:03:08.280> eye<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.459> I

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
both for the mercenary red eye and I

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.610 
both for the mercenary red eye and I
believe<00:03:09.269> he's<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.319> people

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
believe he's one that a lot of people

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.710 
believe he's one that a lot of people
are<00:03:10.709> excited<00:03:11.010> about<00:03:11.220> he<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> recon<00:03:12.390> class

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
are excited about he is a recon class

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
are excited about he is a recon class
but<00:03:12.959> he<00:03:13.019> specializes<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.769> close<00:03:14.010> combat<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
but he specializes in close combat so

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.309 
but he specializes in close combat so
the<00:03:15.150> first<00:03:15.359> thing<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.959> guys<00:03:16.019> here

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
the first thing I have for you guys here

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.960 
the first thing I have for you guys here
is<00:03:16.440> his<00:03:16.560> ability<00:03:17.099> which<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> infrared

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
is his ability which is the infrared

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.970 
is his ability which is the infrared
goggles<00:03:18.359> which<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:19.019> see<00:03:19.200> gives<00:03:19.829> us

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
goggles which I can see gives us

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.129 
goggles which I can see gives us
infrared<00:03:20.459> vision<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.299> you'll<00:03:21.599> see<00:03:21.840> why<00:03:22.079> this

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
infrared vision and you'll see why this

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.259 
infrared vision and you'll see why this
would<00:03:22.440> work<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:22.889> nicely<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.609> kind<00:03:24.120> of

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
would work really nicely when we kind of

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.780 
would work really nicely when we kind of
then<00:03:24.389> show<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.139> next<00:03:25.410> item<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.040> red<00:03:26.760> eye

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
then show the next item the red eye

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.640 
then show the next item the red eye
himself<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.720> character<00:03:28.169> who<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.319> believe<00:03:28.620> a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
himself is a character who I believe a

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.710 
himself is a character who I believe a
lot<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.010> people<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.340> interested<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
lot of people are interested in it's a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.509 
lot of people are interested in it's a
kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.560> secondary<00:03:31.919> ability<00:03:32.099> as<00:03:32.400> this

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
kind of secondary ability as this

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.330 
kind of secondary ability as this
infrared<00:03:32.910> his<00:03:33.180> primary<00:03:33.660> ability<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.680> smoke

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
infrared his primary ability is a smoke

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.979 
infrared his primary ability is a smoke
grenade<00:03:35.370> which<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:36.180> will<00:03:36.299> be<00:03:36.419> shown<00:03:36.599> in<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.900> a

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
grenade which we will be shown in just a

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.870 
grenade which we will be shown in just a
second<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.799> infrared<00:03:38.190> there<00:03:38.760> is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
second but with this infrared there is

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.759 
second but with this infrared there is
just<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.180> standard<00:03:39.419> recharge<00:03:40.109> time<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.620> at

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
just a standard recharge time with it at

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.059 
just a standard recharge time with it at
the<00:03:41.069> moment<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.959> then<00:03:42.959> yeah<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:43.680> nice<00:03:43.859> it

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
the moment and then yeah it's nice it

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.710 
the moment and then yeah it's nice it
allows<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:44.910> smoke<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.299> also

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
allows you to see for the smoke and also

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
allows you to see for the smoke and also
adds<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.380> lot<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.530> contrast<00:03:46.980> when<00:03:47.160> you're

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
adds a lot of contrast when you're

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.190 
adds a lot of contrast when you're
looking<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.609> people<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.630> as<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.840> mentioned<00:03:49.109> my

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
looking at people so as I mentioned my

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.129 
looking at people so as I mentioned my
guys<00:03:49.349> offer<00:03:49.650> ability<00:03:50.069> is<00:03:50.280> his<00:03:50.310> smoke<00:03:50.700> grenades

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
guys offer ability is his smoke grenades

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.240 
guys offer ability is his smoke grenades
and<00:03:52.139> as<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.500> see<00:03:52.560> here<00:03:52.919> that<00:03:53.040> they're

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and as you can see here that they're

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.159 
and as you can see here that they're
pretty<00:03:53.489> decent<00:03:53.940> they're<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.269> super<00:03:54.989> good

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
pretty decent they're not super good

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.409 
pretty decent they're not super good
like<00:03:55.470> prior<00:03:55.919> over-the-top<00:03:56.730> smoke<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.299> they'd

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
like prior over-the-top smoke but they'd

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.509 
like prior over-the-top smoke but they'd
certainly<00:03:57.629> add<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.260> kind<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.650> small<00:03:58.859> area<00:03:59.310> of

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
certainly add a kind of small area of

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.580 
certainly add a kind of small area of
kind<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.819> limited<00:04:00.299> vision<00:04:00.629> which<00:04:01.049> pedlar<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
kind of limited vision which pedlar is

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.409 
kind of limited vision which pedlar is
infrared<00:04:01.950> pathetically<00:04:02.639> interesting<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.269> I

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
infrared pathetically interesting and I

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.150 
infrared pathetically interesting and I
feel<00:04:04.049> like<00:04:04.169> this<00:04:04.260> could<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.620> kind<00:04:05.040> of

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
feel like this could really kind of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.890 
feel like this could really kind of
shake<00:04:05.400> things<00:04:05.760> up<00:04:05.940> when<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.239> comes<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.629> kind<00:04:06.780> of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
shake things up when it comes to kind of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.839 
shake things up when it comes to kind of
an<00:04:07.139> objective<00:04:07.889> game<00:04:08.160> modes<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.549> enough<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
an objective game modes be enough to

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.550 
an objective game modes be enough to
smoke<00:04:09.060> an<00:04:09.239> objective<00:04:09.750> when<00:04:10.319> you're<00:04:10.440> adding

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
smoke an objective when you're adding

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.439 
smoke an objective when you're adding
this<00:04:10.859> Mike<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.190> do<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.489> some<00:04:11.970> limited

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
this Mike you do have some limited

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.030 
this Mike you do have some limited
vision<00:04:12.629> and<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.169> actually<00:04:13.290> looks<00:04:13.560> quite<00:04:13.739> good

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
vision and it actually looks quite good

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.949 
vision and it actually looks quite good
I<00:04:14.310> hate<00:04:14.609> garius<00:04:15.060> where<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.389> all<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.720> smoke
