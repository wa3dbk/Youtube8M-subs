lot<00:03:51.300> younger<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.080> do<00:03:52.290> remember<00:03:53.510> having<00:03:54.510> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
lot younger but I do remember having a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.910 
lot younger but I do remember having a
little<00:03:54.959> bit<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.110> pocket<00:03:55.230> money<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.560> going<00:03:55.830> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
little bit of pocket money and going to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.190 
little bit of pocket money and going to
the<00:03:56.010> shop<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.459> not<00:03:56.610> knowing<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.300> buy<00:03:57.629> so

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
the shop and not knowing what to buy so

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.289 
the shop and not knowing what to buy so
I<00:03:58.230> bought<00:03:58.470> things<00:03:58.769> because<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.760> album<00:04:00.120> art
