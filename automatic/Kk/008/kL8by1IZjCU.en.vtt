too no it's a great question this is a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
too no it's a great question this is a
technology<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.449> certainly<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.530> on

the<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:17.790> time<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.240> describe<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> suit<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the first time so describe the suit a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
the first time so describe the suit a
little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.650> holes<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
little bit because it has holes in the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
little bit because it has holes in the
feet<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> straight<00:01:21.479> jacket<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.409> we're

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
feet and it's a straight jacket so we're

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
feet and it's a straight jacket so we're
talking<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.310> strategic

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
talking about here is strategic

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
talking about here is strategic
compression<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> compressed<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> body

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
compression so we compressed the body

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
compression so we compressed the body
around<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> key<00:01:26.490> soft<00:01:26.909> tissue<00:01:27.150> areas<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
around the key soft tissue areas of the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
around the key soft tissue areas of the
muscles<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.590> talking<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.009> Heather's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
muscles so we're talking in Heather's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.969 
muscles so we're talking in Heather's
case<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> quads<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.689> calves<00:01:31.110> her

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
case about the quads the calves her

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
case about the quads the calves her
upper<00:01:32.220> body<00:01:32.369> anywhere<00:01:33.210> where<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> muscles

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
upper body anywhere where the muscles

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
upper body anywhere where the muscles
have<00:01:34.020> been<00:01:34.049> fatigued<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.920> traumatized<00:01:35.490> during

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
have been fatigued or traumatized during

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
have been fatigued or traumatized during
a<00:01:36.090> game<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.770> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a game what we want to do here is we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
a game what we want to do here is we
want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> control<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> swelling<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.270> those

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
want to control the swelling of those

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
want to control the swelling of those
muscles<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> micro<00:01:40.560> level<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> fibers

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
muscles at a micro level so the fibers

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270 
muscles at a micro level so the fibers
after<00:01:42.750> she<00:01:43.079> works<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.710> she's<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> game

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
after she works out or she's in a game

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
after she works out or she's in a game
those<00:01:44.759> fibers<00:01:45.030> send<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> signal<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> body

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
those fibers send a signal to the body

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
those fibers send a signal to the body
to<00:01:46.500> send<00:01:46.680> water<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.250> area<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:48.119> suit

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to send water to the area this suit

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.030 
to send water to the area this suit
actually<00:01:48.600> compresses<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> keeps<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> water

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
actually compresses that keeps the water

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
actually compresses that keeps the water
at<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> manageable<00:01:50.640> level<00:01:50.790> within<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> fibers

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
at a manageable level within the fibers

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
at a manageable level within the fibers
and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.619> increases<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> magnitude<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and then increases the magnitude of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
and then increases the magnitude of
repair<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> those<00:01:54.780> muscles<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> undergo<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
repair that those muscles can undergo in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
repair that those muscles can undergo in
a<00:01:55.920> shorter<00:01:56.219> timeframe<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.270> isn't<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> suit

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a shorter timeframe so this isn't a suit

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
a shorter timeframe so this isn't a suit
that<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.140> wear<00:01:58.259> during<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.070> games<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that you would wear during the games and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
that you would wear during the games and
during<00:01:59.820> your<00:01:59.850> sports<00:02:00.329> activity<00:02:00.840> strictly

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
during your sports activity strictly

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.050 
during your sports activity strictly
after<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> games<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
after the games and it's about the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
after the games and it's about the
recovery<00:02:03.509> process<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.259> when<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.619> three

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
recovery process and when you have three

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.319 
recovery process and when you have three
games<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.340> week<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.119> week

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
games in a week like we do this week

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
games in a week like we do this week
it's<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.689> being<00:02:07.500> able<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.950> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
it's all about being able to get out in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's all about being able to get out in
the<00:02:08.099> field<00:02:08.190> faster<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.910> able<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> recover

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the field faster and be able to recover

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
the field faster and be able to recover
after<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> games<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.229> about<00:02:10.349> 24<00:02:10.739> hours

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
after the games and it's about 24 hours

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.650 
after the games and it's about 24 hours
that<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.310> wear<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
that would wear it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.780 
that would wear it
afterwards<00:02:12.050> certainly<00:02:12.740> about<00:02:12.950> 24<00:02:13.370> hours<00:02:13.520> is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
afterwards certainly about 24 hours is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.000 
afterwards certainly about 24 hours is
what<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.060> recommend<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.440> again<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
what we recommend and and again the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.740 
what we recommend and and again the
compression<00:02:16.490> around<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:17.090> compared<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> what

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
compression around here compared to what

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.360 
compression around here compared to what
you'd<00:02:17.870> wear<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> field<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.950> compression

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you'd wear on the field the compression

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.620 
you'd wear on the field the compression
on<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.490> field<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.970> doing<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.240> lot<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.420> different

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
on the field is doing a lot of different

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.330 
on the field is doing a lot of different
things<00:02:20.870> for<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.500> regulating<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.280> body

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
things for you it's regulating your body

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.220 
things for you it's regulating your body
temperature<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:23.420> controlling<00:02:23.960> muscle

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
temperature it's controlling muscle

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.200 
temperature it's controlling muscle
vibration<00:02:24.770> when<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.220> talk<00:02:25.400> about<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.820> we're

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
vibration when we talk about this we're

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.790 
vibration when we talk about this we're
looking<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:26.600> immobilizing<00:02:27.350> those<00:02:27.470> muscle

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
looking at immobilizing those muscle

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.680 
looking at immobilizing those muscle
fibers<00:02:27.830> at<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> very<00:02:28.580> micro<00:02:28.760> level<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.630> she

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
fibers at a very micro level so she

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.720 
fibers at a very micro level so she
sacrifices<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.560> bit<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.860> mobility<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.550> she'd

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
sacrifices a bit of mobility that she'd

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.310 
sacrifices a bit of mobility that she'd
need<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.270> field<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:33.080> why<00:02:33.260> this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
need on the field and that's why this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.290 
need on the field and that's why this
compression<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.340> really<00:02:34.850> appropriate<00:02:35.060> for

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
compression is really appropriate for

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.940 
compression is really appropriate for
off<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> field<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> after<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> game<00:02:36.620> what

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
off the field and after the game what

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.530 
off the field and after the game what
are<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.100> advantages<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:37.880> far<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.450> know

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
are the advantages as far as you know

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.300 
are the advantages as far as you know
would<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.810> substitute<00:02:39.320> icing<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:39.890> taping

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
would you substitute icing and taping

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.640 
would you substitute icing and taping
for<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:41.000> suit<00:02:41.300> or<00:02:41.540> or<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.200> would<00:02:42.320> still<00:02:42.530> do

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
for this suit or or you would still do

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
for this suit or or you would still do
those<00:02:42.800> things<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.820> icing<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.570> very

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
those things so icing is a very

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.570 
those things so icing is a very
traditional<00:02:45.190> thing<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.220> mean<00:02:46.430> Heather

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
traditional thing I mean Heather

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.730 
traditional thing I mean Heather
probably<00:02:47.210> all<00:02:47.600> growing<00:02:47.840> up<00:02:47.930> knows<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.440> 20

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
probably all growing up knows about 20

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.320 
probably all growing up knows about 20
minutes<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> 20<00:02:49.550> minutes<00:02:49.790> off<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:50.150> ice

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
minutes on and 20 minutes off with ice

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.840 
minutes on and 20 minutes off with ice
ice<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.200> more<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.470> an<00:02:51.560> analgesic<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.460> think<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
ice is more of an analgesic so think of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.400 
ice is more of an analgesic so think of
like<00:02:53.030> aspirin<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:53.720> designed<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.260> help

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
like aspirin it's designed to help

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530 
like aspirin it's designed to help
control<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> body's<00:02:55.670> swelling<00:02:56.030> over<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.270> short

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
control the body's swelling over a short

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.060 
control the body's swelling over a short
period<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.870> time<00:02:56.960> but<00:02:57.530> as<00:02:57.620> soon<00:02:57.710> as<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> ice<00:02:58.040> is

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
period of time but as soon as the ice is

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.370 
period of time but as soon as the ice is
removed<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.820> swelling<00:02:59.210> comes<00:02:59.360> back<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.200> this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
removed that swelling comes back so this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
removed that swelling comes back so this
is<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> technology<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.090> controls

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
is a this is a technology that controls

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.390 
is a this is a technology that controls
that<00:03:02.600> swelling<00:03:03.020> over<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.470> whole<00:03:03.680> 24<00:03:04.250> hour

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
that swelling over the whole 24 hour

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.250 
that swelling over the whole 24 hour
period<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.970> once<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.630> swelling<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.110> under

period and once that swelling is under

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.900 
period and once that swelling is under
control<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:07.070> what<00:03:07.310> lets<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.610> muscle

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
control that's what lets the muscle

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.640 
control that's what lets the muscle
fibers<00:03:08.300> rebuild<00:03:08.870> themselves<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.470> more

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
fibers rebuild themselves in a more

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.200 
fibers rebuild themselves in a more
efficient<00:03:10.040> manner<00:03:10.340> all<00:03:10.550> right<00:03:10.700> I'm<00:03:10.760> sold<00:03:11.060> so

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
efficient manner all right I'm sold so

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.940 
efficient manner all right I'm sold so
where<00:03:11.360> can<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.570> get<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.080> says<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.530> costs

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
where can I get it and I says it costs

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.610 
where can I get it and I says it costs
