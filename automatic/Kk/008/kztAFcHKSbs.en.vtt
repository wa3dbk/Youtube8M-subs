00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.800 

the<00:00:27.949> song<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.340> only<00:00:28.640> two<00:00:28.939> parts<00:00:29.509> we<00:00:29.689> have<00:00:29.720> a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
the song is only two parts we have a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.200 
the song is only two parts we have a
verse<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.349> we<00:00:30.500> have<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.710> chorus<00:00:31.210> first

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.610 
it to chuck at the feel to it I'm doing
four<00:00:57.460> measures<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.180> D<00:00:58.570> like<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.110> on<00:00:59.350> pop

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
four measures of D like this on pop

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.320 
four measures of D like this on pop
music<00:01:00.160> playing<00:01:01.150> eighth<00:01:01.510> note<00:01:01.870> triplets<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
music playing eighth note triplets and

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.180 
music playing eighth note triplets and
then<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.600> one<00:01:04.869> measure<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.290> a<00:01:05.680> one

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
then we have one measure of a one

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.630 
then we have one measure of a one
measure<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.580> G<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.390> two<00:01:07.600> measures<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.110> D<00:01:10.259> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
measure of G and two measures of D and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
measure of G and two measures of D and
that<00:01:12.640> makes<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.390> first<00:01:13.690> chord<00:01:14.050> progression

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that makes the first chord progression

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.960 
that makes the first chord progression
so<00:01:15.670> again<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.210> was<00:01:16.420> four<00:01:17.259> measures<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.680> D<00:01:17.970> one

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so again that was four measures of D one

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.719 
so again that was four measures of D one
measure<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.570> one<00:01:20.229> measure<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.649> G<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.310> then

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
measure of a one measure of G and then

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.990 
measure of a one measure of G and then
two<00:01:22.180> measures<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.750> D<00:01:22.960> again<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.910> going

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
two measures of D again and it's going

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.730 
two measures of D again and it's going
to<00:01:25.060> happen<00:01:25.210> twice<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.869> progression<00:01:26.259> happens

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
to happen twice this progression happens

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.270 
to happen twice this progression happens
two<00:01:27.640> times<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.780> second<00:01:29.289> time<00:01:29.500> instead<00:01:30.220> of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.360 

as<00:03:29.090> earlier<00:03:29.570> we're<00:03:30.140> using<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.950> triplets

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
as earlier we're using all the triplets

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.220 
as earlier we're using all the triplets
one<00:03:32.060> should<00:03:32.240> live<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.540> trip<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.870> future<00:03:33.170> of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the fortune but now we're just using the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:49.050 
the fortune but now we're just using the
ends<00:03:35.630> 1<00:03:36.080> 2<00:03:36.460> 2<00:03:37.460> 2<00:03:37.490> 1<00:03:38.000> &amp;<00:03:38.450> 2<00:03:38.480> &amp;<00:03:38.990> 3<00:03:39.110> &amp;<00:03:39.440> 4

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
like that so only two parts and that's

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.830 
like that so only two parts and that's
it<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.760> way<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.000> works<00:03:55.180> is<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.480> after<00:03:55.780> you
