noticed<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.860> first<00:03:26.070> time<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.250> put<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.460> in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
noticed that the first time I put it in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.000 
noticed that the first time I put it in
and<00:03:26.820> blurred<00:03:27.120> my<00:03:27.450> peripheral<00:03:27.960> vision<00:03:28.010> so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and blurred my peripheral vision so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.950 
and blurred my peripheral vision so
every<00:03:29.340> time<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.520> turn<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.180> way<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:30.630> turn<00:03:30.750> that

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
every time I turn that way or turn that

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.440 
every time I turn that way or turn that
way<00:03:31.170> with<00:03:31.410> my<00:03:31.530> eyes<00:03:31.710> it's<00:03:32.190> kind<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.490> blurry<00:03:32.730> but

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
way with my eyes it's kind of blurry but

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.210 
way with my eyes it's kind of blurry but
once<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.080> wear<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.650> at<00:03:34.710> least<00:03:34.860> 30

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
once you wear it in for at least 30

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.910 
once you wear it in for at least 30
minutes<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.970> kind<00:03:36.270> of<00:03:36.330> had<00:03:36.480> justice<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
minutes it kind of had justice and it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250 
minutes it kind of had justice and it
just<00:03:38.160> blends<00:03:38.670> right<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
just blends right in and I like that a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.650 
just blends right in and I like that a
lot<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.920> noticed<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.430> does<00:03:41.700> dry<00:03:42.240> after

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
lot and I noticed that it does dry after

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
lot and I noticed that it does dry after
a<00:03:42.690> little<00:03:42.900> bit<00:03:43.080> over<00:03:43.350> eight<00:03:43.590> hours<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:44.250> work

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
people kind of you know they didn't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.880 
people kind of you know they didn't
really<00:04:12.690> notice<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.110> because<00:04:13.230> my<00:04:13.440> eyes<00:04:13.590> were<00:04:13.740> so

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
really notice it because my eyes were so

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.770 
really notice it because my eyes were so
dark<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.430> with<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.150> doesn't<00:04:15.540> stand

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
dark and with this on it doesn't stand

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.289 
dark and with this on it doesn't stand
out<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.109> back<00:04:16.290> which<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:17.310> enlarges<00:04:18.180> my

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
out as back which I like and enlarges my

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.000 
out as back which I like and enlarges my
eyes

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
eyes

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.240 
eyes
and<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:20.020> can<00:04:21.020> see<00:04:21.200> that<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.590> just<00:04:21.620> makes<00:04:22.010> me<00:04:22.220> look

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
and I can see that it just makes me look

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.480 
and I can see that it just makes me look
dolly<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:23.180> guess<00:04:23.630> you'd<00:04:23.870> call<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.140> dolly<00:04:24.560> but

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
dolly I guess you'd call that dolly but

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.250 
dolly I guess you'd call that dolly but
it<00:04:25.670> doesn't<00:04:25.970> want<00:04:26.120> just<00:04:26.240> my<00:04:26.390> eye<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.870> what<00:04:27.230> I

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
it doesn't want just my eye and what I

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.750 
it doesn't want just my eye and what I
notice<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.890> has<00:04:27.980> a<00:04:28.010> black<00:04:28.340> ring

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
notice is that it has a black ring

solution<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:20.870> use<00:05:21.170> is<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.620> optically

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
solution that I use is the optically

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.100 
solution that I use is the optically
pure<00:05:22.490> moist<00:05:22.850> this<00:05:23.450> one's<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:23.750> little<00:05:23.810> bit<00:05:23.990> more

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
pure moist this one's a little bit more

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.330 
pure moist this one's a little bit more
expensive<00:05:24.320> than<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.680> right<00:05:24.830> go<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.010> opt<00:05:25.190> it

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
expensive than the right go to opt it

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.190 
expensive than the right go to opt it
free<00:05:25.520> just<00:05:25.700> because<00:05:26.150> it's<00:05:26.450> pure<00:05:26.690> moist<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
free just because it's pure moist and

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.590 
free just because it's pure moist and
it's<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.740> new<00:05:27.950> formulation<00:05:28.370> it's<00:05:29.000> comfort<00:05:29.480> and

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
it's a new formulation it's comfort and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.180 
it's a new formulation it's comfort and
moisture<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:30.320> would<00:05:30.620> pay<00:05:30.800> three<00:05:31.160> dollars

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
moisture and I would pay three dollars

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.790 
moisture and I would pay three dollars
extra<00:05:31.670> to<00:05:31.790> have<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.210> bottle<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.870> I<00:05:33.140> love
