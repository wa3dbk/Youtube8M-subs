00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello friends today i am you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 I'll tell you how to most competently 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 measure fuel consumption on a scooter 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.980
 there are many different ways 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:25.109
 fuel metering method there is such 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.080
 when the carburetor turns off 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 gasoline float chamber 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.530
 and pour all the gasoline out of the gas tank then 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.960
 liter of gas is poured into the gas tank 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.450
 pump gas into the carburetor and we 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.660
 we are going until we have a cutter 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.690
 stall 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 the way is good but dangerous firstly well 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 it is possible and zaglohni somewhere on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.930
 crossroad busy crossroad we 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 block it we have a car knocks this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 uncomfortable in the second they always want 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.359
 by flushing gas from the tank burn it from 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.049
 carburetor 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.700
 it is long hemorrhagic and make it unpleasant 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.920
 especially 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.720
 I will now tell about the way how without 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.869
 excess hemorrhoids 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.970
 measure fuel consumption on a scooter 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.650
 I explain because we do not need anything 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 pour pour there clean 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.479
 burn gasoline from the carburetor way 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 very simple 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.049
 we need only and measuring 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.409
 glass cups here are approximately 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.390
 there are different sold in any store a 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.909
 painting materials that is, as in them 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 paint can be stirred 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.329
 any other to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.140
 and even with a measuring cup usually 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.100
 economy is a beer there who licked 500 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 grams would be up to 200 grams here 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:07.590
 proper gasoline explain the principle 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.319
 measurements on 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.010
 in particular on the funds in the gas tank 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.560
 there is such a limit 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.360
 wand limit and here on sticks out 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 high is that is we pour 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 gasoline at this limiter 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.810
 here's a fill so that he was behind hide 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 gasoline all closed to fun and recorded 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:45.970
 on the run let's say I will take the example 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.850
 on a piece of paper there is so let's say 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.150
 we run 44 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:57.040
 95 and 3 write this this all this just 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.340
 Elementary, I'll tell you what was all 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.470
 clear 4 495 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 and three gasoline models opened the tank we 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.500
 rode the scooter no matter how much sight 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.510
 on a hundred 3 it does not matter there 100-200 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 the belts traveled an hour the trains did not matter 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.130
 mileage we do n't care about temporary food not 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.829
 it is important to stop at all 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.370
 convenient place for you 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:28.269
 open and gas tank and start 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.519
 opilivat measured glass and gas to 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.760
 as long as we have 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.320
 the limiter will not hide the shore again 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 the river is given the same level 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.190
 Here we write how much and we filled 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 gasoline and tell we filled let's say 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.140
 one and a half liters of gasoline until the morning liters 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.359
 gasoline and mileage we have become 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.130
 Well, let's say after the trip, let the whole y 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.980
 let's say now 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:01.660
 from shit ashe take 4500 well let's say 20 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.829
 kilometers there 100 meters here and by 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:09.609
 simple calculations we drove 25 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:14.280
 kilometers kilometers cut in 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.800
 and the day is no longer read one and a half liters 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.250
 Now 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.460
 further what we do to us find out 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.780
 fuel consumption per liter for 100 kilometers 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:33.650
 we need to share liters these liters then 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.390
 there are 1 and 5 we divide by 0 25 we get 1 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.630
 fuel liters per 100 kilometers i.e. 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.690
 teach you consumption 6 liters per 100 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.670
 kilometers just all elementary way 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.870
 but the safe were the day and not stalled thread 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:54.200
 on the road you won't fall a day there i mean i 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.530
 I will give the custom carefree and after happy 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.530
 with him 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:04.700
 this way we already have 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.770
 clear fuel consumption understandable without 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.440
 excess hemorrhoids 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.290
 Now our calculation is just I took the numbers 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.020
 from the baldies therefore outraged consumption 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.580
 invasion of labor you saw yourself 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.190
 actually fuel times should 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.380
 leave 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.220
 anaconda for two stroke area with three 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.720
 half a liter on chinese quarter 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.990
 about two and a half liters like this 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.600
 that's just one of exceedances of fuel already 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.840
 may reflect well, that is, driving style 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.370
 may affect fuel consumption 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.030
 aggressive driving style is already more expense 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.700
 riding its more expense here's the principle 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.680
 I stopped right now, I will explain to you, I hope everything 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.820
 it was clear to everyone that you were maxim 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.820
 Azarov all bye
