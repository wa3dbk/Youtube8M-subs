00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi this is Albert with mainland cycle

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi this is Albert with mainland cycle
center<00:00:03.540> today<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.929> want<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.200> show<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.640> 2014

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640

KTM<00:00:06.470> 500<00:00:07.470> xcw<00:00:09.080> 500<00:00:10.080> x<00:00:10.320> DW<00:00:10.639> now<00:00:11.750> KTM's<00:00:13.519> if<00:00:14.519> you're

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
KTM 500 xcw 500 x DW now KTM's if you're

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.320 
KTM 500 xcw 500 x DW now KTM's if you're
familiar<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:15.900> KTMs<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.740> then<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.060> start

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
familiar with KTMs at all then you start

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.570 
familiar with KTMs at all then you start
to<00:00:18.480> learn<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> these

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to learn what some of this some of these

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
to learn what some of this some of these
numbers<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.180> letters<00:00:21.480> mean<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.500> name<00:00:22.680> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
numbers and letters mean in the name so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700 
numbers and letters mean in the name so
this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> 500<00:00:24.119> 500<00:00:24.689> CC<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> actually<00:00:25.500> five

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this is a 500 500 CC it's actually five

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.970 
this is a 500 500 CC it's actually five
hundred<00:00:26.039> ten<00:00:26.220> CCS<00:00:27.050> XC<00:00:28.050> means<00:00:28.380> cross<00:00:28.680> country

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
hundred ten CCS XC means cross country

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.330 
hundred ten CCS XC means cross country
and<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> W<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.119> wide<00:00:30.390> ratio<00:00:30.900> transmission<00:00:31.710> now

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and the W is wide ratio transmission now

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
and the W is wide ratio transmission now
most<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> KTM<00:00:33.600> s<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> KTM<00:00:35.899> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
most of the KTM s you can have a KTM you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
most of the KTM s you can have a KTM you
can<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.140> an<00:00:37.290> XC<00:00:37.739> without<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> w<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.850> can

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
can have an XC without the w you can

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650 
can have an XC without the w you can
have<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.210> X<00:00:39.360> CF<00:00:40.219> usually<00:00:41.219> an<00:00:41.399> XC<00:00:41.969> without<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> f

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
have an X CF usually an XC without the f

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
have an X CF usually an XC without the f
means<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.200> two<00:00:43.410> stroke<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.940> case

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
means it's two stroke but in this case

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
means it's two stroke but in this case
it's<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> 500<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:46.680> put<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> F

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's a 500 so they don't put the F

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's a 500 so they don't put the F
because<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:48.840> make<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> 500<00:00:49.500> CC

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because we don't make a 500 CC

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.549 
because we don't make a 500 CC
two-stroke<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.660> don't<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> tell<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
two-stroke so you don't need to tell you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.900 
two-stroke so you don't need to tell you
that<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> five<00:00:52.980> hundreds<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> four<00:00:53.670> stroke

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that a five hundreds of four stroke

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.260 
that a five hundreds of four stroke
because<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.730> 502<00:00:56.730> stroke<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
because they don't make a 502 stroke so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990 
because they don't make a 502 stroke so
it's<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> 500<00:00:58.410> x<00:00:58.620> cfw<00:00:59.460> although<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's not a 500 x cfw although it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's not a 500 x cfw although it
probably<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.050> could<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:02.039> not

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
probably would be here could be it's not

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
probably would be here could be it's not
what<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.520> called<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.480> 500<00:01:04.019> xew<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
what it's called it's a 500 xew but it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.630 
what it's called it's a 500 xew but it
is<00:01:05.040> four<00:01:05.339> stroke<00:01:06.710> maybe<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.799> confused<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
is four stroke maybe I confused you but

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200 
is four stroke maybe I confused you but
