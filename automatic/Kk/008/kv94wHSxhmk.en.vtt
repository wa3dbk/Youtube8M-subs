00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
background next we're going to use some

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.960 
background next we're going to use some
heart<00:00:28.530> shapes<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.340> those<00:00:29.610> are<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.850> to<00:00:29.910> be

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
heart shapes and those are going to be

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.940 
heart shapes and those are going to be
the<00:00:30.090> ears<00:00:30.360> on<00:00:30.540> the<00:00:30.630> side<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.290> that<00:00:31.560> square

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
the ears on the side of that square

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.650 
the ears on the side of that square
you're<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.700> kind<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> squish<00:00:33.330> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you're going to kind of squish the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.680 
you're going to kind of squish the
hearts<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.740> then<00:00:35.190> move<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
hearts and then move them over to the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
hearts and then move them over to the
edge<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.220> size<00:00:38.490> of<00:00:38.700> those

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
edge so that just the the size of those

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.730 
edge so that just the the size of those
are<00:00:38.970> showing<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> duplicate<00:00:40.230> those

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
are showing you want to duplicate those

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.490 
are showing you want to duplicate those
layers<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.600> color<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.990> green<00:00:43.260> color

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
layers and color them that green color

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
layers and color them that green color
and<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.790> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> edge<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and so you just kind of get the edge of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.220 
and so you just kind of get the edge of
the<00:00:47.010> ears<00:00:47.510> next<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.630> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.810> move<00:00:48.990> on<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the ears next we're going to move on to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
the ears next we're going to move on to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.420 
varying shapes and links and kind of put
them<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:46.049> places<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.189> tube

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
them in in places that are not a tube

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.510 
them in in places that are not a tube
uniform<00:01:48.320> next<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.409> start<00:01:49.650> using<00:01:49.860> some<00:01:50.130> circles

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
uniform next I start using some circles

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.640 
uniform next I start using some circles
for<00:01:50.729> her<00:01:50.850> mouth<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.299> drew<00:01:51.689> squash<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> circles

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
for her mouth I drew squash the circles

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.859 
for her mouth I drew squash the circles
down<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.040> read<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.280> oval<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.810> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
down to read an oval and then I kind of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
down to read an oval and then I kind of
across<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.400> that<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.880> they

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
across them you see that there they

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
across them you see that there they
almost<00:01:57.210> make<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.960> X<00:01:58.200> shape<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.100> lopsided<00:01:59.880> X

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
almost make an X shape and lopsided X

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.890 
almost make an X shape and lopsided X
and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> cover<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.920> those<00:02:02.189> circles<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.939> use

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and then to cover up those circles I use

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.800 
and then to cover up those circles I use
a<00:02:04.080> rounded<00:02:04.650> square<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:05.700> had<00:02:05.820> put<00:02:06.000> behind<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a rounded square that had put behind the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.509 
a rounded square that had put behind the
trunk<00:02:07.080> layers<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.830> top<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.340> mouth

to change the layers wish it to do is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.170 
to change the layers wish it to do is
click<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> shape<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.970> move

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
click on the shape that you want to move

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
click on the shape that you want to move
in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.630> layers<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.770> use<00:02:16.890> your

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
in the layers and then you use your

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.150 
in the layers and then you use your
d-pad<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.640> move<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.880> back<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.270> forth<00:02:19.160> next

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
d-pad to move it back and forth next

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.620 
d-pad to move it back and forth next
you'll<00:02:20.280> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.580> give<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.970> mouth<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.330> good

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
you'll want to give for a mouth a good

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.320 
you'll want to give for a mouth a good
dark<00:02:22.170> outline<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.030> you'll<00:02:24.210> just

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
dark outline and to do that you'll just

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330 
dark outline and to do that you'll just
duplicate<00:02:24.870> those<00:02:25.020> layers<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.650> expand<00:02:26.160> those

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
duplicate those layers and expand those

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
duplicate those layers and expand those
circles<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.570> color<00:02:27.810> those<00:02:28.020> black<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
circles out and color those black and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
circles out and color those black and
put<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> background<00:02:30.230> next<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.320> move<00:02:31.530> on

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
put it in the background next I move on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
put it in the background next I move on
to<00:02:31.860> our<00:02:31.890> teeth<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.270> used<00:02:33.570> some<00:02:33.690> half

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
to our teeth and I just used some half

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.770 
to our teeth and I just used some half
circle<00:02:34.830> shapes<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.700> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.300> make<00:02:36.540> more

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
circle shapes that I kind of make more

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.440 
circle shapes that I kind of make more
like<00:02:37.050> ovals<00:02:37.530> cut<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.920> half<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:39.240> want<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
like ovals cut in half you want to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.990 
like ovals cut in half you want to
shrink<00:02:39.870> those<00:02:40.050> down<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.430> order<00:02:41.850> them

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
shrink those down and then order them

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.810 
shrink those down and then order them
appropriately<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.020> layers<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
appropriately in the layers so that the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.200 
appropriately in the layers so that the
teeth<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.210> going<00:02:45.390> behind<00:02:45.660> her<00:02:46.020> trunk<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:47.210> so

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
teeth are going behind her trunk and so

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.120 
teeth are going behind her trunk and so
I'm<00:02:48.450> using<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.020> think<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.350> four<00:02:49.620> teeth<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
I'm using I think it's four teeth in

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.850 
I'm using I think it's four teeth in
total<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.580> put<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:50.910> there<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.710> two<00:02:52.710> of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
total that I put up there and two of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.470 
total that I put up there and two of
them<00:02:52.980> kind<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.430> are<00:02:53.550> going<00:02:53.820> behind<00:02:53.970> her<00:02:54.210> trunk

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
them kind of are going behind her trunk

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.300 
them kind of are going behind her trunk
so<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.780> gives<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.110> effect<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.830> illusion<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
so it gives the effect the illusion that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.540 
so it gives the effect the illusion that
there's<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:56.730> teeth<00:02:56.970> there<00:02:58.010> now<00:02:59.010> once<00:02:59.220> i<00:02:59.340> get

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
there's more teeth there now once i get

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.100 
there's more teeth there now once i get
her<00:02:59.700> mouth<00:02:59.850> all<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.300> together<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.810> kind<00:03:01.050> of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
her mouth all put together I kind of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.960 
her mouth all put together I kind of
feel<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.320> her<00:03:01.650> ears<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.070> crowding<00:03:02.640> her<00:03:02.730> face

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
feel like her ears are crowding her face

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.670 
feel like her ears are crowding her face
a<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.150> bit<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.540> lined<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.930> backing<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
a little bit so I lined up backing the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.920 
a little bit so I lined up backing the
ears<00:03:04.920> off<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> little<00:03:05.490> bit<00:03:05.640> more<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.480> there's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
ears off a little bit more so there's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.870 
ears off a little bit more so there's
just<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.470> little<00:03:07.710> bit<00:03:07.830> less<00:03:08.100> they're<00:03:08.400> showing

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
just a little bit less they're showing

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.720 
just a little bit less they're showing
and<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.570> wind<00:03:09.810> up<00:03:10.130> expanding<00:03:11.130> her<00:03:11.280> mouth<00:03:11.490> out<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
and I wind up expanding her mouth out a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.190 
and I wind up expanding her mouth out a
little<00:03:11.880> bit<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.270> tree<00:03:12.750> trunks<00:03:13.050> has<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
little bit because tree trunks has a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.699 
little bit because tree trunks has a
really<00:03:13.560> wide<00:03:13.950> long<00:03:14.430> mouth<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.230> didn't

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
really wide long mouth and so it didn't

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.199 
really wide long mouth and so it didn't
look<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.220> for<00:03:17.280> her<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:17.790> such<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> small

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
look right for her to have such a small

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.960 
look right for her to have such a small
mouth<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.080> stretch<00:03:20.010> everything<00:03:20.310> out<00:03:20.640> kind

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
mouth so I stretch everything out kind

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.000 
mouth so I stretch everything out kind
of<00:03:21.060> move<00:03:21.240> things<00:03:21.600> around<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:22.080> little<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.410> get

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
of move things around a little bit get

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.070 
of move things around a little bit get
it<00:03:23.160> looking<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.459> perfect<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.240> we're<00:03:24.780> almost

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
it looking just perfect and we're almost

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.520 
the mouth and I duplicate that and
extend<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.690> make<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.870> look<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.380> it

expands<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> other<00:03:45.270> side<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
expands over to the other side of the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.160 
expands over to the other side of the
trunk<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.739> well<00:03:47.090> now<00:03:48.090> for<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> final<00:03:48.660> steps

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
trunk as well now for the final steps

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.930 
trunk as well now for the final steps
there's<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.830> couple<00:03:50.070> layers<00:03:50.370> left<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.880> I'm

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
there's a couple layers left and I'm

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.100 
there's a couple layers left and I'm
thinking<00:03:51.150> what<00:03:51.390> do<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.510> want<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:51.959> this

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
thinking what do I want to do with this

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.250 
thinking what do I want to do with this
well<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> decided<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.520> duplicate<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.810> curved

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
well I decided to duplicate the curved

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.320 
well I decided to duplicate the curved
line<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:56.100> side<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.459> her<00:03:56.610> car<00:03:56.880> trunk

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
line on the right side of her car trunk

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.199 
line on the right side of her car trunk
and<00:03:57.570> then<00:03:58.260> change<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> opacity<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.060> looks

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
and then change the opacity so it looks

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.030 
and then change the opacity so it looks
more<00:04:00.360> like<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.570> shadow<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.170> then<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.800> with

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
more like a shadow and then I do with

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.370 
more like a shadow and then I do with
the<00:04:02.130> same<00:04:02.340> with<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.820> left<00:04:02.850> ear<00:04:03.540> i<00:04:03.600> duplicate

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the same with the left ear i duplicate

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.130 
the same with the left ear i duplicate
that<00:04:04.560> black<00:04:04.920> heart<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.550> then<00:04:06.300> change<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
that black heart and then change the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.540 
that black heart and then change the
opacity<00:04:07.260> down<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.010> don't<00:04:08.040> remember<00:04:08.430> how

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
opacity down if you don't remember how

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.490 
opacity down if you don't remember how
to<00:04:08.610> change<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.000> opacity<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:10.050> use<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
to change the opacity you use the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.880 
to change the opacity you use the
bumpers<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.850> then<00:04:12.260> after<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.410> we're<00:04:13.650> done

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
bumpers and then after that we're done

bumpers and then after that we're done
