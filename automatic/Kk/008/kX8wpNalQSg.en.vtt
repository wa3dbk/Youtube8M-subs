00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.420
 welcome to all 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.280
 I have prepared a new video tutorial 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.860
 to bring you a simple application in 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.889
 simple program 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.520
 which will be very useful if they are 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.619
 of those who discharge fires and see their 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 computer turned on every night 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 in a always record to turn off the pc 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.830
 in a certain time assigned time 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.280
 it automatically shuts down with a simple 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.949
 archive 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.530
 for all exportables can take it and 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.079
 place it on another computer and the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 other names called to pay owns 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.640
 some simple or person there is as a label 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.550
 if they are already downloaded very fast 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.180
 download as I want to lie a lot of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.200
 archive 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 let's open it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.120
 and when you know it, it's such a simple interface 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 certain programs with 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 simple 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.710
 option in the introductions we have 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.410
 Here we see that the section on 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 works of the section minutes will be separated 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.540
 the second we will follow the options that 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.340
 we want you to do the program we can 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.980
 turn off the paid computer the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.730
 computer restart suspend not 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.550
 can in internal mode finish some 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.170
 process start some process or to 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.220
 some process 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 then the to place suppose that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.950
 they are unloading an egg 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 let's say the game was missing in two 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.040
 hours so you know that they are going to be placed 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.140
 very good to treat it within three 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.600
 hours 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.450
 to place 3 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.469
 and now only minute 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.899
 three hours six minutes and with three 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.799
 seconds let's suppose then we talk 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.350
 here in this program we are going to go through it 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.660
 over time 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.660
 because we now 78 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.530
 it will automatically end 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.410
 I make very very simple now 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 as it indicates that it will show a warning 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 that the computer turns off 30 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940
 seconds before to be able to configure 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.990
 we can cancel until now how 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.990
 set the seconds 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.810
 I guess he wants us to want him to 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.140
 show 10 seconds before it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.849
 will turn off computer to specify 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.849
 now jump would oppose the time 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.080
 the chronometer so to speak we have 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.380
 well at the time you have in these 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.300
 moments for example people 10 and 51 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.030
 here they are going to be put to it to turn off 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.110
 between 10 hours 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.710
 22 hours 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.710
 at 22 hours 50 minutes 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.739
 and then automatically 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.980
 but if we give it on timer for 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.319
 power 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.690
 you will be able to use the program 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.940
 normally we are going to restart inside 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.860
 an opening prayer if we want it 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.420
 within 30 minutes so they are in 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.890
 130 minutes 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.650
 if we want it to restart inside 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.830
 suppose 30 seconds let's mark 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.950
 well and start running about 30 seconds 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.880
 to restart our computer 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.250
 then this is something very fast very 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.500
 easy but you liked it were very 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.360
 useful in my opinion to download games 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.280
 I am one of them 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.440
 and not wanting to the provenance and my life 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.940
 where all day then I wait for them 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.100
 have liked this little program 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.530
 we are subscribe, comment on me 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.870
 like 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.680
 I want to arise in this I want 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.580
 promise but I believe to be able to continue 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.470
 doing tutorials 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.859
 then see you in the next video and 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.859
 see you later
