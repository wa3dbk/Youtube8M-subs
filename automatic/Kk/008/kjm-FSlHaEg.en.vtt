00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
all flying at about 800 feet or below
and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> number<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.390> light

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and then there are a number of light

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500 
and then there are a number of light
planes<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> tremendous<00:00:50.730> amount<00:00:51.449> of

planes you see a tremendous amount of
air<00:00:51.690> traffic<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> wonder

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
air traffic and I just have to wonder

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.529 
air traffic and I just have to wonder
whether<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.210> might<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.360> been<00:00:54.449> another

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
whether there might have been another

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
whether there might have been another
aircraft<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> well<00:00:55.469> I'll<00:00:55.680> tell<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
aircraft and well I'll tell you what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.260 
aircraft and well I'll tell you what
we're<00:00:56.280> learning<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:56.910> we're<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
we're learning now and we're just

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
we're learning now and we're just
getting<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.840> crossing<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.559> our

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
getting this crossing it's our

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.930 
getting this crossing it's our
understanding<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.280> witnesses<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.910> the

where would I sit down set down because
you<00:04:57.729> look<00:04:58.030> around<00:04:58.590> Manhattan<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.740> even<00:04:59.950> on

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
you look around Manhattan and even on

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.409 
you look around Manhattan and even on
the<00:05:00.100> far<00:05:00.340> side<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.700> river<00:05:00.850> on<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.120> Jersey

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
the far side of the river on the Jersey

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.510 
the far side of the river on the Jersey
side<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.750> river<00:05:01.930> there<00:05:02.229> is<00:05:02.440> no<00:05:02.740> open<00:05:03.220> space

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
side of the river there is no open space

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.370 
side of the river there is no open space
knowing<00:05:03.970> normally<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.780> look<00:05:04.930> for<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> golf

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
knowing normally you look for a golf

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.170 
knowing normally you look for a golf
course<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.889> look<00:05:05.979> for<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.340> baseball<00:05:06.700> diamond

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
course you look for a baseball diamond

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.060 
course you look for a baseball diamond
anything<00:05:07.930> there's<00:05:08.290> nothing<00:05:08.620> like<00:05:08.740> that<00:05:08.919> in

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
anything there's nothing like that in

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.860 
anything there's nothing like that in
that<00:05:09.190> part<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.460> Manhattan<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.030> maybe<00:05:10.389> if<00:05:10.660> this

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
that part of Manhattan so maybe if this

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.270 
that part of Manhattan so maybe if this
pilot<00:05:11.080> had<00:05:11.350> some<00:05:11.590> kind<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.830> an<00:05:11.950> engine<00:05:12.160> problem

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
pilot had some kind of an engine problem

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.730 
pilot had some kind of an engine problem
he<00:05:13.120> figured<00:05:13.419> out<00:05:13.540> that<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.930> Hudson<00:05:14.500> River<00:05:14.680> was

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
he figured out that the Hudson River was

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.050 
he figured out that the Hudson River was
going<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.100> be<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.280> place<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.610> try<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.790> put<00:05:15.970> it

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
going to be the place to try to put it

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.730 
going to be the place to try to put it
down<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.570> guess<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.139> were<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.410> look

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
down and I guess if you were to look

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.330 
down and I guess if you were to look
west

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
west

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.010 
west
the<00:05:18.520> only<00:05:18.880> thing<00:05:19.150> over<00:05:19.419> there<00:05:19.540> anywhere<00:05:19.900> would

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
the only thing over there anywhere would

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.050 
the only thing over there anywhere would
be<00:05:20.139> the<00:05:20.229> Teterboro<00:05:20.680> Airport<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.460> that's<00:05:21.940> a

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
be the Teterboro Airport and that's a

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.370 
be the Teterboro Airport and that's a
long<00:05:22.300> way<00:05:22.660> from<00:05:22.720> where<00:05:22.990> we're<00:05:23.080> talking<00:05:23.169> about

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
long way from where we're talking about

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.990 
long way from where we're talking about
here<00:05:23.560> at<00:05:23.710> least<00:05:23.889> 15<00:05:24.460> miles

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
here at least 15 miles

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.080 
here at least 15 miles
yeah<00:05:25.210> if<00:05:25.510> in<00:05:25.870> fact<00:05:26.139> the<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.889> pilot<00:05:27.370> was<00:05:27.580> at<00:05:27.880> a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
yeah if in fact the this pilot was at a

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.590 
yeah if in fact the this pilot was at a
fairly<00:05:28.479> low<00:05:28.750> elevation<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.650> mean<00:05:29.830> typically

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
fairly low elevation I mean typically

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.570 
fairly low elevation I mean typically
air<00:05:31.600> traffic<00:05:31.900> control<00:05:32.320> will<00:05:32.500> have<00:05:32.650> me<00:05:32.919> fly<00:05:33.280> at

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
air traffic control will have me fly at

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.630 
air traffic control will have me fly at
1,500<00:05:34.360> feet<00:05:34.510> sometimes<00:05:34.810> 2,000<00:05:35.770> feet<00:05:35.950> because

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
1,500 feet sometimes 2,000 feet because

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.700 
1,500 feet sometimes 2,000 feet because
you<00:05:36.729> have<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:36.970> stay<00:05:37.150> under<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:38.169> air<00:05:38.350> traffic

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
you have to stay under the air traffic

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.070 
you have to stay under the air traffic
the<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.990> zone<00:05:41.410> for<00:05:42.070> Newark<00:05:42.729> Airport<00:05:43.270> which<00:05:43.930> is

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
the the zone for Newark Airport which is

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080 
the the zone for Newark Airport which is
fairly<00:05:44.289> close<00:05:44.560> so<00:05:44.800> this<00:05:44.950> this<00:05:45.220> pilot<00:05:45.640> may<00:05:45.850> have

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
fairly close so this this pilot may have

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.510 
fairly close so this this pilot may have
been<00:05:46.300> fairly<00:05:47.260> low<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.710> if<00:05:47.800> you<00:05:47.919> had<00:05:48.070> some<00:05:48.310> kind

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
been fairly low and if you had some kind

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.950 
been fairly low and if you had some kind
of<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.640> problem<00:05:48.850> hit<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.150> goose<00:05:49.390> or<00:05:49.600> something

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
of a problem hit a goose or something

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.450 
of a problem hit a goose or something
you<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.320> don't<00:05:50.590> have<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.010> much<00:05:51.039> time<00:05:51.400> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
you just don't have that much time to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.210 
you just don't have that much time to
make<00:05:51.910> correction<00:05:52.450> my<00:05:53.200> police<00:05:53.560> source<00:05:53.830> is<00:05:54.039> now
