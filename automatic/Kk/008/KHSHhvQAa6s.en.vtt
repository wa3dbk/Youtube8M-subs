00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.539 
I think the main advantage of autonomous
parking<00:01:55.510> is<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.930> added<00:01:56.290> convenience<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:57.280> not

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
parking is the added convenience of not

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.580 
parking is the added convenience of not
having<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.180> park<00:01:58.510> your<00:01:58.659> vehicle<00:01:59.049> by<00:01:59.200> yourself

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
having to park your vehicle by yourself

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.270 
having to park your vehicle by yourself
and<00:01:59.830> also<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:00.970> save<00:02:01.210> time<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:03.100> when

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
and also that you can save time so when

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.999 
and also that you can save time so when
you<00:02:03.369> arrive<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.140> parking<00:02:05.140> lot<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.799> leave

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
you arrive at a parking lot you leave

you arrive at a parking lot you leave
your<00:02:06.250> vehicle<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.090> designated<00:02:07.299> drop-off

once again gets into the vehicle and
then<00:02:47.980> drives<00:02:48.250> off<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.690> believe<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.959> self

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
then drives off I believe that the self

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.900 
then drives off I believe that the self
parking<00:02:50.500> car<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.890> much<00:02:51.100> more<00:02:51.310> than<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.610> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
parking car is much more than just a

step towards the self parking car by

step towards the self parking car by
