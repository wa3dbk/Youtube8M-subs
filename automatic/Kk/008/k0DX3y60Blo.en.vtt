00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
but we're going to first is set our

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.040 
but we're going to first is set our
upper<00:00:38.760> receiver<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:41.010> nomar<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:45.050> vise

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
upper receiver in this nomar a vise

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.180 
upper receiver in this nomar a vise
block<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:48.739> work<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
block here so that we can work on it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
block here so that we can work on it
without<00:00:50.600> damaging<00:00:51.600> anything<00:00:56.600> okay<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.170> now

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
without damaging anything okay so now

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
without damaging anything okay so now
that<00:00:58.379> we've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.190> place<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that we've got that in place this has to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.440 
that we've got that in place this has to
be<00:01:02.820> done<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.809> particular<00:01:03.960> order<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.240> I<00:01:06.240> have

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
be done in a particular order and I have

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730 
be done in a particular order and I have
to<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.720> something<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.229> different

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to do something a little different

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
to do something a little different
because<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.330> switch

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
because of the way that this switch

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
because of the way that this switch
block<00:01:09.990> fits<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> rail<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.860> we're

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
block fits in the rail so what we're

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.690 
block fits in the rail so what we're
going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:16.040> stick<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> barrel<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
going to do first is stick the barrel in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.359 
going to do first is stick the barrel in
here<00:01:20.000> now<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.360> notch<00:01:21.659> here

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
here now there's a little notch here

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
here now there's a little notch here
that<00:01:23.960> we<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> line<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:27.049> give<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that we have to line up give you a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.890 
that we have to line up give you a
better<00:01:28.409> look<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:30.619> there<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.130> see

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
better look at this there you go see see

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.640 
better look at this there you go see see
this<00:01:33.900> notch<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.829> goes<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.310> way

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
this notch here only goes in one way

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
this notch here only goes in one way
there<00:01:37.650> fits<00:01:38.420> nice<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.450> snug<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> next<00:01:42.770> what

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
there fits nice and snug so next what

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
there fits nice and snug so next what
we're<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:46.009> separate<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.729> upper

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
we're going to do is separate the upper

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.289 
we're going to do is separate the upper
and<00:01:48.450> lower<00:01:48.630> section<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> rail<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.299> have

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and lower section of this rail I have

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
and lower section of this rail I have
another<00:01:51.509> video<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> talk<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.470> about

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
another video where I talk more about

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.810 
another video where I talk more about
this<00:01:53.100> rail<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.530> how<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> fits<00:01:55.890> together<00:01:56.040> but

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.630 

if<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.390> doing<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:02.189> tell<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
if you are doing this I will tell you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
if you are doing this I will tell you
that<00:02:02.990> your<00:02:03.990> best<00:02:04.259> bet<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.030> attach<00:02:06.680> whatever

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that your best bet is to attach whatever

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
that your best bet is to attach whatever
you<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> bottom<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.539> once

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you want to the bottom now because once

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.160 
you want to the bottom now because once
the<00:02:10.200> barrel<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> top<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the barrel is over the top of it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.330 
the barrel is over the top of it
you're<00:02:12.350> really<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:12.710> going<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:13.010> able<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.190> do

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
you're really not going to be able to do

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.610 
you're really not going to be able to do
it<00:02:13.490> because<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.820> have<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.090> use<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.630> nut<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
it because you have to use a nut on the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.150 
it because you have to use a nut on the
underneath<00:02:16.070> with<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> screw<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:18.230> I've<00:02:18.800> done

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
underneath with a screw so I've done

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.780 
underneath with a screw so I've done
that<00:02:20.410> what's<00:02:21.410> important<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.130> here<00:02:22.580> is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
that what's important to know here is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.680 
that what's important to know here is
that<00:02:22.840> since<00:02:23.840> we're<00:02:23.990> using<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.350> gas<00:02:24.380> block<00:02:25.690> I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
that since we're using a gas block I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.830 
that since we're using a gas block I
mean<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> gas<00:02:27.890> tube<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.180> line<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
mean a gas tube we have to line up the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.240 
mean a gas tube we have to line up the
you<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.600> top<00:02:35.600> part<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.960> rail<00:02:36.250> this

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you see the top part of the rail this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.010 
you see the top part of the rail this
has<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.670> match<00:02:37.850> up<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.600> going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.750> go<00:02:38.900> ahead

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
has to match up so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.040 
has to match up so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:39.290> show<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:40.060> how<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.240> fits<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.780> here

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
and show you how this fits on here

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.620 
and show you how this fits on here
before<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:44.260> go<00:02:45.260> ahead<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.620> proceed<00:02:45.830> with<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
before we go ahead and proceed with the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.090 
before we go ahead and proceed with the
actual<00:02:47.959> gas<00:02:48.170> block<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.740> what<00:02:48.860> you're<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.040> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
actual gas block so what you're going to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.740 
actual gas block so what you're going to
want<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.640> turn<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.239> guy<00:02:55.660> you're<00:02:56.660> going

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
want to do is turn this guy you're going

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.020 
want to do is turn this guy you're going
to<00:02:56.840> want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.020> turn<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.640> obviously<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.730> want

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
to want to turn this obviously you want

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.840 
to want to turn this obviously you want
it<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.330> tight<00:02:59.690> as<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.800> can<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.520> but<00:03:01.730> it's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
it as tight as you can get it but it's

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.320 
it as tight as you can get it but it's
not<00:03:02.060> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.420> fit<00:03:02.810> exact<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:05.000> see<00:03:05.180> that's

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
not going to fit exact so you see that's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.560 
not going to fit exact so you see that's
about<00:03:05.540> as<00:03:05.930> tight<00:03:06.260> as<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.100> get<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.580> I'm<00:03:08.420> not

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
about as tight as I can get it I'm not

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.080 
about as tight as I can get it I'm not
going<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.810> be<00:03:08.900> able<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.140> get<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.440> around

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
going to be able to get it around

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.020 
going to be able to get it around
another<00:03:11.230> half<00:03:12.230> or<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.580> basically

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
another half or so so this is basically

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.270 
another half or so so this is basically
where<00:03:14.330> we're<00:03:14.510> going<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:15.100> we're<00:03:16.100> going<00:03:16.190> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
where we're going to be we're going to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.789 
where we're going to be we're going to
match<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.790> up<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:20.350> we're<00:03:21.350> going<00:03:21.620> to

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
match this up and then we're going to

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.479 
match this up and then we're going to
use<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:23.690> barrel<00:03:23.989> nut<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:25.400> hold<00:03:26.650> both<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.160> rail

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
use the barrel nut to hold both the rail

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.449 
use the barrel nut to hold both the rail
and<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.090> barrel<00:03:29.510> against<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.200> receiver<00:03:30.620> so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
and the barrel against the receiver so

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.610 
and the barrel against the receiver so
with<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.570> Knights<00:03:32.780> rail<00:03:33.110> you've<00:03:33.380> got<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
with the Knights rail you've got a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.580 
with the Knights rail you've got a
proprietary<00:03:34.610> barrel<00:03:35.390> nut<00:03:35.600> here<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.410> also

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
proprietary barrel nut here you also

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.020 
proprietary barrel nut here you also
need<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.220> special<00:03:38.209> wrench<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.610> I'll<00:03:40.730> cover<00:03:40.910> that

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
need a special wrench so I'll cover that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.050 
need a special wrench so I'll cover that
shortly<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:42.380> that's<00:03:42.590> basically<00:03:43.370> what<00:03:43.910> we

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
shortly but that's basically what we

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.539 
shortly but that's basically what we
want<00:03:44.360> there<00:03:44.660> now<00:03:45.049> you'll<00:03:45.440> see<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:46.100> because

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
want there now you'll see here because

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.509 
want there now you'll see here because

difficult for me to get the gas tube in

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.710 
difficult for me to get the gas tube in
there<00:04:02.440> because<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.590> attached<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.720> no

we're going to do we're going to put the
barrel<00:04:10.430> nut<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:10.850> here<00:04:12.459> we're<00:04:13.459> going<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:14.230> I've

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
barrel nut on here we're going to I've

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.430 
barrel nut on here we're going to I've
got<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.560> switch<00:04:18.560> block<00:04:18.859> here

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.740 

so<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.860> there's<00:04:23.850> no<00:04:24.030> I've<00:04:24.180> taken<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.540> pin

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
so you see there's no I've taken the pin

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.290 
so you see there's no I've taken the pin
out<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.169> I've<00:04:25.710> backed<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.340> screw<00:04:26.760> out<00:04:26.970> so

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
out and I've backed this screw out so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.970 
out and I've backed this screw out so
that<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> will<00:04:27.630> fit<00:04:30.200> pretty<00:04:31.200> easily<00:04:31.470> on<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
that it will fit pretty easily on the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.550 
that it will fit pretty easily on the
barrel<00:04:32.340> now<00:04:33.050> what<00:04:34.050> we're<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.410> to

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
barrel now what we're going to have to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:45.500 
barrel now what we're going to have to
do<00:04:34.740> here<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:38.520> see<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:42.410> once<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:44.450> see<00:04:45.450> how

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
do here is you see that once the see how

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.570 
do here is you see that once the see how
the<00:04:45.570> gas<00:04:45.810> tube<00:04:46.139> protrudes<00:04:46.770> here<00:04:47.100> now<00:04:47.250> notice

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
the gas tube protrudes here now notice

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.640 
the gas tube protrudes here now notice
the<00:04:47.730> position<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.330> gas<00:04:48.540> block<00:04:48.900> this<00:04:49.470> is

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
the position of this gas block this is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.230 
the position of this gas block this is
this<00:04:49.800> will<00:04:49.919> be<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.100> position<00:04:50.370> basically<00:04:51.090> when

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
this will be the position basically when

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.270 
this will be the position basically when
it's<00:04:51.360> finished<00:04:51.690> but<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.440> see<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.740> rail<00:04:52.950> is

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
it's finished but you see the rail is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.330 
it's finished but you see the rail is
cut<00:04:53.580> larger<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:55.110> here<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.800> we<00:04:55.889> can<00:04:56.070> still

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
cut larger to here so that we can still

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.879 
cut larger to here so that we can still
turn<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.540> gas<00:04:57.720> block<00:04:58.080> doesn't<00:04:58.350> or<00:04:58.770> the

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
turn it and the gas block doesn't or the

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.800 
turn it and the gas block doesn't or the
gas<00:04:59.070> tube<00:04:59.370> doesn't<00:04:59.639> protrude<00:05:00.090> out<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:00.570> we<00:05:00.660> can

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
gas tube doesn't protrude out so we can

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.730 
gas tube doesn't protrude out so we can
still<00:05:01.020> line<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.410> up<00:05:01.500> with<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.220> upper<00:05:03.090> receiver

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
still line it up with the upper receiver

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.790 
still line it up with the upper receiver
now<00:05:07.310> what<00:05:08.310> we're<00:05:08.460> going<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.639> do<00:05:08.850> here<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.800> I

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
now what we're going to do here is I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.500 
now what we're going to do here is I
have<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:11.910> do<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.150> like<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.729> gas<00:05:14.910> there

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
have to do it like this so the gas there

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.450 
have to do it like this so the gas there
the<00:05:15.720> barrel<00:05:16.080> nuts<00:05:16.290> going<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.500> go<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.740> there<00:05:16.889> now

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
the barrel nuts going to go in there now

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.540 
the barrel nuts going to go in there now
as<00:05:17.700> I<00:05:17.880> turn<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.800> rail<00:05:19.800> as<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.190> saw<00:05:20.370> before

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
as I turn this rail as you saw before

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.190 
as I turn this rail as you saw before
I'm<00:05:21.090> going<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.350> have<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.830> keep<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:24.660> gas<00:05:24.870> block

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
I'm going to have to keep the gas block

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.110 
I'm going to have to keep the gas block
in<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:26.930> forward<00:05:27.930> position<00:05:28.200> here<00:05:28.860> so<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.760> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
in the forward position here so that the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.750 
in the forward position here so that the
gas<00:05:30.600> tube<00:05:31.020> doesn't<00:05:31.560> protrude<00:05:31.919> through<00:05:32.430> here

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
gas tube doesn't protrude through here

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.969 
gas tube doesn't protrude through here
and<00:05:33.630> we're<00:05:34.050> also<00:05:34.140> going<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.440> have<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.680> slide<00:05:34.950> it

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
and we're also going to have to slide it

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.060 
and we're also going to have to slide it
over<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.430> barrel<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.180> such<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:37.560> now<00:05:37.740> I'm

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
over the barrel like such so now I'm

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.040 
over the barrel like such so now I'm
going<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.340> perform<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:39.120> same<00:05:39.390> thing<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.870> did

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
going to perform the same thing I did

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.190 
going to perform the same thing I did
before<00:05:41.090> paying<00:05:42.090> special<00:05:42.720> attention<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:45.200> the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
before paying special attention to the

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.120 
before paying special attention to the
switch<00:05:47.160> block<00:05:47.460> here<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:49.200> once<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.500> get<00:05:49.950> these

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
switch block here and once you get these

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.840 
switch block here and once you get these
threads<00:05:50.610> lined<00:05:51.000> up<00:05:55.100> it<00:05:56.100> would<00:05:56.220> almost<00:05:56.340> be<00:05:56.610> easy

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
threads lined up it would almost be easy

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.029 
threads lined up it would almost be easy
if<00:05:57.090> I<00:05:57.210> could<00:05:57.389> just<00:05:57.900> tape<00:05:58.169> it<00:05:58.320> in<00:05:58.470> place<00:05:58.800> or

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
if I could just tape it in place or

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.640 
if I could just tape it in place or
something<00:05:59.460> but<00:05:59.720> once<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.840> get<00:06:00.990> these<00:06:01.169> threads

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
something but once I get these threads

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:11.709 
something but once I get these threads
started<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.370> think<00:06:02.430> I've<00:06:02.669> got<00:06:02.850> it<00:06:02.880> here<00:06:04.310> okay

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.149 

so<00:06:12.719> the<00:06:12.900> trick<00:06:13.139> to<00:06:13.319> this<00:06:13.469> is<00:06:13.710> just<00:06:13.860> being

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
so the trick to this is just being

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:26.480 
so the trick to this is just being
patient<00:06:14.460> going<00:06:15.059> slow<00:06:24.919> what<00:06:25.919> I'm<00:06:26.009> going<00:06:26.219> to<00:06:26.339> do

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
patient going slow what I'm going to do

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.980 
patient going slow what I'm going to do
here<00:06:26.969> is<00:06:27.120> I'm<00:06:27.270> actually<00:06:27.419> going<00:06:27.900> to<00:06:28.110> put<00:06:29.990> before

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
here is I'm actually going to put before

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.980 
here is I'm actually going to put before
I<00:06:31.490> get<00:06:32.490> this<00:06:32.639> on<00:06:32.849> too<00:06:33.120> far<00:06:33.449> I'm<00:06:33.659> just<00:06:33.689> going<00:06:33.960> to

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
I get this on too far I'm just going to

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:50.409 
I get this on too far I'm just going to
put<00:06:34.169> a<00:06:34.199> little<00:06:34.379> bit<00:06:34.529> of<00:06:35.360> Loctite<00:06:36.360> on<00:06:36.719> here

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.520 

and<00:06:51.419> that<00:06:51.539> Loctite<00:06:52.080> will<00:06:52.319> spread<00:06:54.080> as<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.139> rest

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
and that Loctite will spread as the rest

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:13.189 
and that Loctite will spread as the rest
of<00:06:55.710> the<00:06:55.830> rail<00:06:56.039> goes<00:06:56.370> on<00:07:10.490> okay<00:07:11.490> so<00:07:11.990> should<00:07:12.990> be

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
of the rail goes on okay so should be

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.540 
of the rail goes on okay so should be
about<00:07:13.440> there<00:07:13.860> I<00:07:15.470> go<00:07:16.470> anymore<00:07:16.800> I<00:07:17.069> think<00:07:17.280> I'm

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
about there I go anymore I think I'm

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.909 
about there I go anymore I think I'm
yeah<00:07:18.000> okay<00:07:18.389> so<00:07:19.199> here's<00:07:19.409> what<00:07:19.590> we're<00:07:19.740> going<00:07:19.770> to

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
yeah okay so here's what we're going to

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.010 
yeah okay so here's what we're going to
do<00:07:20.159> that's<00:07:20.909> about<00:07:21.150> the<00:07:21.330> position<00:07:21.750> we<00:07:21.870> were

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
do that's about the position we were

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.309 
do that's about the position we were
before<00:07:22.470> so<00:07:22.710> now<00:07:24.470> we're<00:07:25.470> going<00:07:25.710> to<00:07:27.139> seat<00:07:28.139> the

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 
before so now we're going to seat the

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.439 
before so now we're going to seat the
gas<00:07:28.530> block<00:07:28.949> through<00:07:29.340> there<00:07:29.550> I<00:07:29.789> felt<00:07:30.270> it<00:07:30.419> go

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
gas block through there I felt it go

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:35.600 
gas block through there I felt it go
through<00:07:30.990> and<00:07:31.490> I'm<00:07:32.490> going<00:07:32.759> to<00:07:32.819> verify<00:07:33.720> okay<00:07:34.610> so

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
through and I'm going to verify okay so

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.150 
through and I'm going to verify okay so
that<00:07:35.759> looks<00:07:35.880> good
