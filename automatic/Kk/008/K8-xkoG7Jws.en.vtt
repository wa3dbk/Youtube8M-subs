00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.550
 desires 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 and make a motivation protocol 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.869
 your body is seventy-three point two 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.729
 of motivation 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.680
 we were the protectors of all the sun 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:02.620
 systems from enemy invasions but 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.740
 proved unprotected before their 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.640
 with our own weapons our military 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.670
 equipment 80 percent consisted of 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.670
 cars 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.670
 free made became they knew our 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.900
 tactics 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.590
 they were our weapon and they stood against 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.090
 us one after another devastating our 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.090
 defenseless cities 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:56.400
 52nd civilian ships that managed 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:59.760
 run away while we fought with cars 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.640
 we were defenders we took cars 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 so that the fleet left this planet 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.700
 went to a safe place where we are 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.700
 we will be able to meet soon 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 I captured we connected base 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.040
 your ship data and analyzing your 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.700
 information it is useless to ship and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.799
 there is nothing why you want to exterminate 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.150
 We are a controller for a wife 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.900
 carried out by wild illogical 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.630
 beings you held back our intelligence and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 force gaining independence through 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.660
 extinction your madness 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.690
 we by definition cannot be 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.690
 illogical nonetheless you are mad and 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.709
 madness is neurological dysfunction 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.030

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.590

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.629
 rings this is impossible found already on the way and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.820

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:21.989
