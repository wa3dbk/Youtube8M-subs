00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 there are very good and you fa wanted 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.730
 commenting and I bring you this example and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.839
 is a short action employment nuclear 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.550
 I just wanted to leave the 'march of the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.080
 nuclear because I wanted to tell you something 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.320
 important that is the update that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.670
 have done yesterday that has to see more than 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.139
 nothing with the subject of the remains but 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.350
 well I would put it more thoroughly with her 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 as you see low confirmed on the map of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.060
 kings the thing starts a little frantic 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 and he came to the mpt as you are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.050
 seeing why some of you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 you say that it would rise or that some 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 weapon with some nuclear with some weapon 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.079
 short that is with their rifles because 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.670
 it has long since completed the nuclear 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 with rifles and then I want to bring 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.700
 nuclear with all weapons but good 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 as it had not been for a long time 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.059
 rifles then equal for a 97 that a weapon 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 that I like a lot and also a class a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.829
 little more varied than the one again 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 as you are seeing I have a long cannon and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 butt and good apart the hard day came 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 with bulletproof vest scavenger hardness and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.949
 Tactical mask is usually not only 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.719
 iván said of with and tactical mask but 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.550
 these days particularly people 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.340
 He started running quite in plan known 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 with shock charges with c4 yes with loot 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.359
 betis iván fucks a few streaks d 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.159
 of nuclear not also some other 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:10.619
 pineapple random is to say pineapples that you eat 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.689
 going for a place that was not even for you 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 that pineapple but good with these 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 advantages because lately I'm going 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 something better that yes the putada is that not 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.479
 could wide marker on the weapon thing 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 that fucks me because many times you can 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 to leave more is enemies followed as 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 in this case and do not have the bullets not the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.950
 you need are lucky you have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.179
 a 40-bullet magazine and it's 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 pretty good because it gives you a lot 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.780
 although it has a very high rate but 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.759
 good is a class that as I said 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 nuclea of ​​class for nuclear is a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.869
 alternative removes you is an accessory of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.459
 the steel joker primary and you get the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.049
 vest you remove the aesthetic and with it 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.569
 the tactical mask and although they are a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.819
 a little more defensive class allow you 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.259
 do not die with explosives and dodge it 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.310
 shocked now yes you've done that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.170
 Many times you can be annoyed 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.329
 nuclear not so well a different class 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.489
 so you can see that he also took out 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.890
 nuclear with other kinds of classes and not 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.209
 well he came to talk to you more than anything 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.729
 about the television they have made today 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.110
 good yesterday sorry I was more than 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.390
 nothing playing and this gameplay yesterday and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.099
 that's why I wanted to attract him today because it's a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.959
 gameplay that is done with the new 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.069
 use and that have touched so much 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.079
 Carlos Respawn has not touched 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.540
 responds meaning to move them from site 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.249
 nothing of that just that they support them the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.889
 theme of the influence that you have on 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.060
 put a certain area of the map 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.040
 So what is this before the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.810
 update you got into your base or 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 near their base and they answered it is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.930
 say they were going to the other end of the map and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.280
 you had to run to the other 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.129
 new point to be able to mark that they have 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.409
 done now so much with the influence 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.389
 of respond so that you no longer have so much 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.250
 Influence when you put yourself in your back 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.659
 as you are seeing for many 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.840
 moments of the gameplay I'm in this area 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.909
 most of the gameplay and what happens 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.439
 well that although I am in this area 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.239
 they will continue to be born there that is 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.859
 one thing that I like very much but 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.719
 that on the other hand on the other hand 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.340
 to be also a fucking man fucking 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.659
 nuclear animals by the simple fact 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.819
 that does not give you time many times 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.560
 recharge all the people who come every 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.510
 person who is coming will leave you 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.129
 more and more red as you see they keep coming out 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.419
 the enemies there however much I follow them 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.609
 killing that keeps going into the 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.199
 answer so according to the conclusion that 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.840
 I can take out after playing 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:12.060
 because between yesterday and today these maps with 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.709
 the towers for new is that a person 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.209
 alone it is very difficult to change the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.110
 answer so this results in 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.310
 most entertaining nuclear weapons more 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.690
 but also a or a juice system 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.940
 more risky so to speak and that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
 Well, what happened to me is like 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.420
 I say for example more like since all 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 the hms that keep doing me there do not 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.490
 I had time to recover or recharge 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.210
 and it just kills me not then I respond 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.190
 with which you have to be very careful 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.080
 I repeat are the same as always but 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.610
 the influence that you or your 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.200
 equipment you have in them is not the same 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.060
 so get used a little after 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.020
 some games and you comment me to see what 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.360
 maybe the response 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.570
 in this new way to me at least I 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.370
 like more but many times or several 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.390
 I sometimes have nuclear fucked by as 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.340
 I tell you that I have left many of 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.720
 blows could not kill everyone so 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 good has also brought out a new mode of 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.350
 game is worth a team match that each 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.180
 Once you kill someone you get 150 points 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.940
 and try a nuclear there I've done 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.459
 several gusts of 10 and something 2025 but it 's 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.290
 very difficult to get a nuclear there and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.489
 good mainly two reasons are 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.280
 most important of all is that it is a 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.690
 duel by teams 65 casualties and counting 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.340
 with which you have to do 30 without 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.840
 they kill you is to say that they have not done you in 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.609
 no not so killed any other streak 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.380
 because it's quite complicated is a 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.880
 nuclear and apart then the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.010
 the game system that people have 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.140
 mode in this mode a pain for teams 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.090
 it's something more campero people play a lot 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.290
 with shotguns with snipers and it's 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.180
 harder to make a streak so I 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.070
 I will keep trying to make it nuclear in 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.510
 that way and without more until prevented and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.620
 boy I hope you liked this 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.270
 gameplay has been liked then leaving me 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.020
 like favorites and subscribe for more 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.020
 goodbye
