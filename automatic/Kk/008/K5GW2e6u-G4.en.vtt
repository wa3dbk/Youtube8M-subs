00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.600
 so look at my job to grow 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:15.730
 my dragon here I go and now I can 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:18.970
 notice here I went in if you already played 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:29.009
 then you know everything and for beginners is about 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:29.009
 press yes oh table only tasks 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:42.730
 here yes then your friend your dragon has become 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.680
 more in direct see it was smaller and 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.920
 I almost like his video when 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.920
 glitchy so choose color 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.519
 asking him is not close and did not interfere so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.519
 I don't understand what's here 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 and so now for a time in type 1 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.430
 I will erase 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.890
 no, now I have my dragon 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.000
 Well, in general, if it looks like five days in a row 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.039
 who don't know something on the fifth day you can 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.450
 get in this diamond and if you accumulate 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:45.380
 I'll see now for the money you can 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.940
 1200 buy became 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 and if you can still 250 some super 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.700
 steep 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.880
 saddle that adds plus 5 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.310
 percent speed your dragon her 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.860
 scepter of 87 crystals worth it 10 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.450
 days to save 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:14.030
 it is important how it looks like this is true 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 familiar color I know that are familiar to us 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.859
 generally it is necessary to go here 3 times first 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.859
 time you take the egg to hatch 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.500
 second time will be able to fly away now 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:27.859
 show what's the catch 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.320
 Now I will show what's funny and so 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.019
 watch our dragon can't lie 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:42.100
 very far 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:47.329
 example fly fly away wait wait i'm here 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.060
 see did nothing declines see 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.769
 i say i do nothing i tell you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.730
 I swear because my hands are busy 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 she's free and that's what's so funny 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.000
 that you fly anywhere 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.640
 Only have to fly so I can still 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.079
 show one tricky tick push 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:17.079
 space is inconvenient so you never 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.079
 happened 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:28.800
 Well, something like that hold 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:33.090
 and now try again now 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.570
 pick it up by the way I can show you 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 secret places to find 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.870
 shorter chaining see we quickly 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.680
 fly and using this may not 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.780
 to fly 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:53.280
 embroider you do not hold holes 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:58.290
 problems can now if you click down 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.910
 to beautifully'll show you what is 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.910
 on the other side of the mountain 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.820
 just about to touch these land 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.750
 ram I am honest without mount 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:24.900
 I did not mount it and by the way, who cares ? 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.390
