00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.800
 yea 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.559
 v 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.230
 it's a principle that we the team tricolor 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.020
 the couple, however, differently 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.570
 the soap opera 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.240
 So we'll use the check, right? 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 I asked for homicide 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.929
 on the Internet 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.869
 always this I'm going to justify that the people that he had with her have 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.680
 a pretty extra pigments in there 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 so I'm going to open and I'll press 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 until the ink starts to come down to tell 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.420
 renata and priscilla 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.150
 min 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.620
 Santo André 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.970
 I already hit the whole tip 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 so I can not work 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.590
 at the other end of the table 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.660
 so we're going to work here in the americanopolis garden this from here that I 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.900
 I cut into the life I bought with 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.800
 It has not been lonely and prince. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.670
 adopt with a canvas can be a cotton cloth 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.880
 and here and the traffic in that 31 squares 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 concierge inter three ice stones talk to think 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.159
 A person 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.159
 this is the part that she looks like an embroidery 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.909
 so here I will go inside the regime twice to make a mini 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.259
 abal trim 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.380
 the arbitration stays a little less 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.980
 and here i will start 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.540
 is counting the squares as if and I will do with the space point 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.540
 cross that cross stitch 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.299
 2 3 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.569
 the third square and seeing 5 squares to cacb two three four 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.729
 five initials in the sixth square 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.079
 and tried to make the point 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.699
 cruise only as a bench I'm going to make the folded cross 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.909
 I passed 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.259
 in regional economies 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 if it were vertical and there is no intention 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:47.250
 It's a bunch of fish here at the waterfront, kind of guy. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.579
 usually grows against the colonel 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.159
 the kingdom of god 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.930
 Let's see if the shirt and cap always made it tight. 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.329
 from there his 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.399
 We have these things. 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.619
 the new things are not 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.739
 cel 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.019
 the organ 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.349
 with a pina shed so much that we had 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.349
 in a great science center alive and well 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.590
 it's good coverage when we try not to stay here 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 until that final point 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.379
 in the last program we did 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.019
 so I'm doing so aware of this measure that I said 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.009
 I was 15 points of this desire 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.419
 point to speak on the tip because it imitates the starting point of the movie the cost per 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.830
 equal 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.830
 the perception 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:47.589
 black red evil beginning of this year our personal ambition to live and to 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.619
 lose 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:50.789
 barred 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:55.219
 false a false tip néstor kirchner glasses can think 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.819
 if they speak German 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.969
 I do not get along very well with embroidery I do not have much common skill 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.899
 the embroidery can escape no right 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:12.309
 there with the launch pen famous for a false cross stitch then create pigs 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.879
 Above you already see some pfizer 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.940
 it is also important to do some detail though the administration 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.180
 so the bank 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.159
 I made this point we have folded 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.170
 now 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.170
 well during the week I'm going to do as he is mean 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.699
 we're here 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.319
 d black with white in the plot gives some india so i make use with cross stitch 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.879
 free is the bar I was doing they came 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.960
 Not so then I made one more carreirinha leave the cross stitch 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.849
 and continued 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 the folded cross stitch that teaches 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.749
 the traffic is a little 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.419
 more advanced 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.919
 and I'll get it 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.839
 Tite admitted 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.449
 Come on then, I'll tell you to pay attention in the clinton corner. 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.550
 so I did the same thing right 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.030
 and leave a space here that I'm going to put a little flower of Palestinians 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.379
 a little button to explain why this how we stop playing 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.849
 yes from there 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.419
 he eats when these goods and how he can hold on to what alone 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.990
 It happened 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.800
 we love it here simple 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 Then I work with Tim 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.259
 I will try 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.900
 this fruit behaving 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.189
 and doing the same 5 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.189
 - yea 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.079
 my job is a little bit with the paint without time 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 have 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.819
 no detail 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.400
 so the spaces 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.900
 its black time first I'm going to use paint in this thermometer movement I go 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.710
 make this move because the ink is the circular ink under penalty 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.319
 newly created 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.559
 this weekend a little piece of paper 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:19.800
 and I'll do 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 so penguins 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.789
 in the case here British denied you had large with white sparkling 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.240
 pearly white looks very cute so the technique still for the enclosure 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.710
 in the end it becomes very scandal if you stay 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.449
 it's the mission 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.899
 and then I spoke with the red paint is another detail 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.149
 another detail that combines with suellen line 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.460
 yea 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 no minho 

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.899
 are 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.899
 read more coming soon 

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.989
 I'm making the spaces even with a black cloth and office boy white girls 

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:17.649
 dead 

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:18.849
 is easy 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.849
 the penguins 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.610
 the 15 names 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.439

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.489
 ae
