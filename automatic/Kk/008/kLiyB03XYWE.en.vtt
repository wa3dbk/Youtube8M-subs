00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.330 
so now I'm just starting by tying up one
of<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.049> sections<00:01:35.289> so<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.799> stays<00:01:35.979> out<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.219> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
of the sections so it stays out of the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.219 
of the sections so it stays out of the
way<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.880> then<00:01:37.359> i'm<00:01:37.450> going<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.689> start<00:01:37.899> braiding

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
way and then i'm going to start braiding

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.840 
way and then i'm going to start braiding
you<00:01:38.770> want<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.009> make<00:01:39.130> sure<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> braid

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
you want to make sure that the braid

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.880 
you want to make sure that the braid
starts<00:01:40.329> at<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.600> very<00:01:40.810> bottom<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.380> your<00:01:41.619> head

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
starts at the very bottom of your head

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.919 
starts at the very bottom of your head
and<00:01:42.069> try<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.759> make<00:01:42.969> it<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.270> tight<00:01:43.299> as<00:01:43.810> possible

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
and try to make it as tight as possible

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.779 
and try to make it as tight as possible
if<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.829> layers<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.520> your<00:01:45.670> hair

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
if you have layers in your hair

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.029 
if you have layers in your hair
especially<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.450> prevent<00:01:46.810> them<00:01:47.020> from<00:01:47.049> flicking

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
especially to prevent them from flicking

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.779 
especially to prevent them from flicking
out<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:51.810> suggest<00:01:52.810> using<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.409> clear<00:01:53.799> elastic<00:01:53.950> to

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
out I suggest using a clear elastic to

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.090 
out I suggest using a clear elastic to
secure<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.270> ponytail<00:01:55.750> but<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.259> didn't<00:01:56.950> have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
secure the ponytail but I didn't have

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.380 
secure the ponytail but I didn't have
any<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.579> couldn't<00:01:57.819> find<00:01:58.000> them<00:01:58.179> at<00:01:58.270> my

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
any and I couldn't find them at my

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.569 
any and I couldn't find them at my
pharmacy<00:01:58.899> so<00:01:59.109> i'm<00:01:59.439> using<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.979> next<00:02:00.340> best

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
pharmacy so i'm using the next best

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.699 
pharmacy so i'm using the next best
option<00:02:00.700> which<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.329> this<00:02:01.659> thinner<00:02:02.079> elastic

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
option which is this thinner elastic

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.859 
option which is this thinner elastic
which<00:02:02.920> matches<00:02:03.340> my<00:02:03.459> hair<00:02:03.670> color<00:02:03.939> but<00:02:04.780> if

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
which matches my hair color but if

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.149 
which matches my hair color but if
you're<00:02:05.020> able<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:05.649> your<00:02:05.770> hands<00:02:06.039> on<00:02:06.099> some

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
you're able to get your hands on some

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.889 
you're able to get your hands on some
clear<00:02:06.610> elastic<00:02:07.179> i<00:02:07.299> would<00:02:07.509> definitely

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
clear elastic i would definitely

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.809 
clear elastic i would definitely
recommend<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.160> now<00:02:09.280> moving<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
recommend that so now moving on to the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.850 
recommend that so now moving on to the
next<00:02:10.090> side<00:02:10.360> i'm<00:02:10.660> first<00:02:10.899> going<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.319> flipping

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
next side i'm first going to be flipping

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.710 
next side i'm first going to be flipping
my<00:02:12.010> bangs<00:02:12.250> over<00:02:12.730> again<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.329> keep<00:02:13.540> those

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
my bangs over again just to keep those

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.839 
my bangs over again just to keep those
out<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.170> way<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.160> exactly<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
out of the way and then do exactly the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.520 
out of the way and then do exactly the
same<00:02:15.879> thing<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.599> making<00:02:16.810> sure<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.319> braid

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
same thing so making sure the braid

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.589 
same thing so making sure the braid
starts<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.370> very<00:02:18.549> bottom<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.060> your<00:02:19.209> head<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
starts the very bottom of your head and

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.480 
starts the very bottom of your head and
making<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.079> as<00:02:20.230> tight<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.680> possible

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.000 

so<00:02:25.480> once<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:25.960> done<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.770> should<00:02:26.950> look

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
so once that's done it should look

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.030 
so once that's done it should look
something<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:28.230> peopie<00:02:29.230> Longstocking

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
something like this peopie Longstocking

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.010

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
at the very top just really started to

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.000 
at the very top just really started to
annoy<00:03:55.810> me<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> took<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.680> pair<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:56.950> scissors
