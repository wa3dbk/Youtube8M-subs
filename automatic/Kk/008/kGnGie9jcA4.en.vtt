00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
of information about that go to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.049 
of information about that go to
wavelength<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> user<00:01:00.930> wishes<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.469> see

so<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.270> let's<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so now let's take a look at how we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
so now let's take a look at how we
manipulate<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.880> customize<00:01:06.630> some<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> these

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
manipulate and customize some of these

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.250 
manipulate and customize some of these
data<00:01:07.320> boxes<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> gained

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
data boxes in what have you gained

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
data boxes in what have you gained
customized<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.070> data<00:01:11.280> boxes<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.970> now

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
customized in my data boxes I'm now

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
customized in my data boxes I'm now
transitioning<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> system<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:14.250> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
transitioning from the system which is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
transitioning from the system which is
where<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.760> before<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> data<00:01:16.140> box<00:01:16.320> right

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
where I was before to the data box right

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.700 
where I was before to the data box right
in<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:18.000> case<00:01:18.210> has<00:01:18.689> simply<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.350> rotor
