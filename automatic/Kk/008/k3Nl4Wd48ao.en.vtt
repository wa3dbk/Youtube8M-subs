00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
 talk about an animated series 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.219
 nickelodeon the magical godfathers since 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 It was one of the best animated series 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.440
 of our childhood and of all 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 the episodes were very funny 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 they broadcast in disney and jetix 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.539
 currently disney xd since already 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.150
 began to broadcast on nickelodeon and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 even when it appeared x had a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.309
 controversy between the fans since there was 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 negative criticism because of them 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.739
 changed the voices of the characters 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 says that the program does not work well and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 others say that they are not as funny as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 it was before the cause of the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.180
 negative reviews are the users of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 the internet more than everything youtube with its 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.120
 critics 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 some understandable ones and ones that are 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.890
 assholes that this part I do not like that

 but harman wanted to introduce us to his 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.330
 dog new magic practitioners 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.380
 addition to the cast of godparents 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.060
 magical 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 talk about the mysterious character 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.420
 dark past and how he hopes to bring the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.369
 show 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.550
 one step closer to the simpsons with 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.410
 on March 23 sparky episode it 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.230
 introduce in this week's episode 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.330
 of July when the worst of the world team and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.430
 owner of the pet is prohibited in 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.410
 all local pet stores 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.569
 jealous that everyone else in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.090
 city ​​has a pet but wishes him 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.100
 a herd of cats later have 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.190
 that adopt a dog to scare away 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.470
 the felines the previous attempts to 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 introduce magical creatures of the series 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.519
 have failed in the past for the series 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.800
 of hero team and they usually have 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.630
 your magical guardians evoke some kind 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.760
 of animal that would simply wreak havoc 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.769
 in the whole episode before having to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.560
 be gone along with all the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.780
 other unfortunate impulsive desires 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.330
 the most important thing with the godparents 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.530
 magic is that with magic you can 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.450
 have anything 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 armand reflects on the issue of 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.819
 series but once you have it which is 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.220
 the drawback what is the problem is 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.040
 as superman you almost have to give him a 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.720
 kryptonite harman says for his series that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.489
 kryptonite is the fact that it is 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.410
 possessed by foolish people whose 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.320
 magical efforts tend to turn 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.090
 of control I love the addition of 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.670
 new characters for godparents 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.860
 magical since it really expands the show 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.570
 tells me art man saying that when 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.520
 initially created the series of 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.740
 nickelodeon his dream was for him to 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.720
 become something like the simpsons 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.700
 where the parcels could cover a 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.340
 Increasing cast of characters 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.260
 secondary now is park is great 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.690
 because children love animals 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.240
 timmy turner loves animals 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.430
 they love animals and obviously not 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.490
 we have magical animals in the program 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.290
 like the simpsons the focus of the 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.210
 series has gradually changed from a 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.610
 main character team and one of the 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.950
 secondary characters cosmo and dad 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.380
 of timmy turner sir so much the actor of 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.750
 voice will give norris armand laughs when 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.940
 says that both characters form a trio 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.190
 of idiocy with crocker carlos alazraki 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.950
 of the Lord giving the series his heart 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.350
 of crazy of little lights comedy although 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.300
 we have a magic show all the 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.160
 the world can do what they need 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.200
 as dad you can get me a 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.720
 gun says arm about the meaning 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 surrealist of the humor series how much 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.709
 more clueless of the character 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.380
 he tells me they put together the comedy more than he can 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.270
 come from him armand says he does not wait 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.070
 change the magical world according to 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 the chaotic wish mastering of cosmo and 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.300
 wanda but will possess spark and magic 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.840
 dog which allows him to evoke the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 bones fire hydrants and similar 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.139
 some of his misadventures include 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.360
 afflicts Tim's hometown and with fleas 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.100
 magical and wishing oneself in a child 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.530
 really jealous that children 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.449
 they seem to have all the attention in 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.940
 does not really add much magic 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.280
 wise but it adds a lot of character to it 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.110
 refers the character is the model of 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.360
 lewis rick moranis character tul and in 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.490
 ghost hunter a beaten dog without 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.889
 word game type of bad luck 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.930
 that has good intentions but is a 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.850
 kind of bobo voice actor taylor mad 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.940
 he was even inspired by moranis for his 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.220
 acting we also wanted to give him something 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.960
 of a murky past says art man no 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.449
 matter where we go from or what 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.250
 let 's make part is already been there or 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.380
 done or know someone who has done it 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.509
 armand joking about a line of a 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.160
 next episode implying that if 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.800
 you need to make a move 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.470
 fast to mexico sparky could connect 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.440
 and that's the reason they arm it 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.539
 it happened to add a new character 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.960
 after that I'm going to tell you the truth 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.810
 I already saw the chapter and it was called 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.539
 ferriol pe according to what I would call a pet 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.940
 magical x of equal is not known how 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.270
 will call in Latin America since not yet 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.759
 They have been transmitted to me, it seemed to me 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.669
 as a good chapter despite its 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.069
 language without subtitles I do not know how you guys 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.500
 this chapter will seem to see more 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.020
 Forward, I hope that the 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 grace of this series and let's hope the 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.449
 episodes that will come out later 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.330
 if you are fanatical of the magical godfathers 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.729
 good for you or you like it 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.490
 all episodes regardless yes 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.190
 be funny or not if they are not 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.770
 fans or do not like this series not 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.590
 matter if they want to make a video 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.930
 with a negative criticism do them but 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.360
 make it more consistent to include why 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.939
 reason you do not like the series 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.219
 the reason I did the video because I did not 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.560
 I had the fucking desire to do and almost no 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.960
 I had college assignments and when 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.819
 I connected on the facebook I found a 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.219
 image they posted on a dog's 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.949
 magic that was going to come out in the series and 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:45.439
 I started to investigate about that since the 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.500
 magical godfathers was the best series 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.689
 from my childhood and I still like it 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.180
 xd every time I investigated until when 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.539
 the chapter went on air on the 23rd 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.550
 March at 7:30 at night in the USA 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.310
 from America 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.650
 other reason is just a warning that 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.319
 I was going to come out later in the godparents 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.509
 magical in case you are interested that is going to see 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.460
 what do you think xd 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.279
 I imagine they thought that there was already 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.110
 finished or canceled the series but that 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.810
 will not happen the magical godfathers 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.000
 will be on air until the decision of 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.550
 good creator that's all 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.229
 comment score if you were interested in the video
