in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> melee<00:01:21.960> stance<00:01:22.259> position<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.009> up

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
in the melee stance position and up

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
in the melee stance position and up
until<00:01:23.520> recently<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.000> thought<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> combo

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
until recently I thought that this combo

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
until recently I thought that this combo
was<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> useless<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.580> could

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
was kind of useless because you could

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.100 
was kind of useless because you could
just<00:01:26.880> throw<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.210> glaive<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.570> normally<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
just throw your glaive out normally and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.999 
just throw your glaive out normally and
then<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.770> close<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then when you want to get up close to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
then when you want to get up close to
enemies<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.119> melee<00:01:30.420> stance

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
enemies you go into your melee stance

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
enemies you go into your melee stance
and<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> combos<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> shred<00:01:31.890> enemies<00:01:32.220> up

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and use the combos to shred enemies up

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.010 
and use the combos to shred enemies up
but<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> turns<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> use<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
but as it turns out if you use this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
but as it turns out if you use this
combo<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> means<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.040> throw<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.460> glaive

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
combo as a means to throw your glaive

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
combo as a means to throw your glaive
out<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.900> an<00:01:37.020> AoE<00:01:37.380> explosion

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
out you can actually do an AoE explosion

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
out you can actually do an AoE explosion
at<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.280> time<00:01:38.610> by<00:01:38.790> pressing<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.270> left<00:01:39.479> click

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
at any time by pressing the left click

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
at any time by pressing the left click
button<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.409> besides<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.829> getting<00:01:41.009> AoE

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
button but besides just getting AoE

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
button but besides just getting AoE
damage<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.119> awesome<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.049> actually

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
damage which is awesome you can actually

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469 
damage which is awesome you can actually
use<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> double<00:01:44.549> damage<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
use this to get double damage what I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
use this to get double damage what I
mean<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> target<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
mean is you can hit the target first and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
mean is you can hit the target first and
then<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.430> any<00:01:47.579> time<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.000> proc<00:01:48.240> an

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
then at any time you can proc an

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
then at any time you can proc an
explosion<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:48.930> after<00:01:49.350> creating<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
explosion right after creating kind of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
explosion right after creating kind of
like<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> double<00:01:50.579> strike<00:01:51.000> effect<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like a double strike effect now the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
like a double strike effect now the
interesting<00:01:52.110> thing<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.979> though<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
interesting thing about it though is

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
interesting thing about it though is
that<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.119> channel<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> glaive

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that you can actually channel the glaive

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
that you can actually channel the glaive
during<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> starla<00:01:55.680> combo<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.219> once<00:01:56.430> it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
during the starla combo but once it's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
during the starla combo but once it's
released<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.509> doesn't<00:01:57.899> seem<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> proc<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
released it doesn't seem to proc the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
released it doesn't seem to proc the
channeling<00:01:59.070> damage<00:01:59.460> effect<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.540> your

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
channeling damage effect at all so your

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.090 
channeling damage effect at all so your
energy<00:02:01.079> won't<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.829> hits<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
energy won't go down when it hits the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
energy won't go down when it hits the
enemy<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> proc<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
enemy and even when you proc the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
enemy and even when you proc the
explosion<00:02:04.049> you'll<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> channeling

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
explosion you'll get the channeling

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
explosion you'll get the channeling
death<00:02:05.610> animation<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.420> energy<00:02:06.570> won't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
death animation but your energy won't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.199 
death animation but your energy won't
drain<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:08.280> also<00:02:08.550> tested<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.149> by

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
drain at all I've also tested this by

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880 
drain at all I've also tested this by
switching<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:09.959> killing<00:02:10.319> blow<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
switching out killing blow with just

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.680 
switching out killing blow with just
regular<00:02:11.069> damage<00:02:11.610> mods<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> elemental<00:02:12.569> mods

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
regular damage mods and elemental mods

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
regular damage mods and elemental mods
and<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.050> seemed<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> would

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and it seemed that I would

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.230 
and it seemed that I would
more<00:02:14.100> damage<00:02:14.370> when<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> didn't<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
more damage when I didn't have the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.090 
more damage when I didn't have the
killing<00:02:15.570> blow<00:02:15.660> equipped<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> seen<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
killing blow equipped so it seen the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.560 
killing blow equipped so it seen the
chalene<00:02:17.460> currently<00:02:17.790> doesn't<00:02:18.090> affect<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
chalene currently doesn't affect the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.450 
chalene currently doesn't affect the
glaives<00:02:18.810> charge<00:02:19.110> attack<00:02:19.380> only<00:02:19.590> its<00:02:20.010> basic

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
glaives charge attack only its basic

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.310 
glaives charge attack only its basic
attacks<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.660> last<00:02:21.870> thing<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.080> want<00:02:22.200> to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
attacks the last thing I just want to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.420 
attacks the last thing I just want to
mention<00:02:22.470> about<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> weapon<00:02:23.040> too<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
mention about the weapon too is that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.130 
mention about the weapon too is that
even<00:02:23.730> though<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.880> only<00:02:24.030> has<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.420> 5%<00:02:24.660> crit

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
even though it only has the 5% crit

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
even though it only has the 5% crit
chance<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> 1.5<00:02:26.190> multiplier<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.850> his

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
chance and the 1.5 multiplier to his

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
chance and the 1.5 multiplier to his
damage<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.900> rare<00:02:28.110> instance<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.740> do

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
damage in the rare instance that you do

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.730 
damage in the rare instance that you do
crit<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.520> was<00:02:29.850> getting<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.180> regions<00:02:30.570> of

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
crit I was getting in the regions of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.650 
crit I was getting in the regions of
25,000<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:31.980> sometimes<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.000> even<00:02:33.600> though

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
25,000 and up sometimes so even though

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.850 
25,000 and up sometimes so even though

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it doesn't really make a lot of sense to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.500 
it doesn't really make a lot of sense to
me<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.580> lot<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.850> fun<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.300> pretty

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.720 
about how to mato the glaive prime and
this<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> little<00:02:41.190> bit<00:02:41.280> different<00:02:41.640> because

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this was a little bit different because

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
this was a little bit different because
it's<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.420> first<00:02:42.630> melee<00:02:43.260> weapon<00:02:43.740> I've<00:02:43.830> covered

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's the first melee weapon I've covered

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.470 
it's the first melee weapon I've covered
where<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> haven't<00:02:44.490> included<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:45.120> killing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
where I haven't included like killing

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.950 
where I haven't included like killing
blow<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.050> corrupt<00:02:46.320> charge<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.770> any<00:02:47.040> kind<00:02:47.640> of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
blow or corrupt charge like any kind of

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.850 
blow or corrupt charge like any kind of
application<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:48.990> channeling<00:02:49.350> damage<00:02:49.620> because

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
application to channeling damage because

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.620 
application to channeling damage because
shelling<00:02:50.430> damage<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.300> strong

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
shelling damage is really really strong

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.050 
shelling damage is really really strong
but<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.590> mentioned<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> video<00:02:53.130> when

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
but like I mentioned in the video when

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.550 
but like I mentioned in the video when
you<00:02:54.150> throw<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> glaive<00:02:54.959> out<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.320> when<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
you throw the glaive out or when you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.860 
you throw the glaive out or when you
proc<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.830> explosion<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.390> effected<00:02:57.840> by

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
proc the explosion it's not effected by

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.120 
proc the explosion it's not effected by
channeling<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.530> don't<00:02:58.650> get<00:02:58.770> any<00:02:58.950> extra

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
channeling so you don't get any extra

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.230 
channeling so you don't get any extra
damage<00:02:59.550> there<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.910> they're<00:03:00.090> basically

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
damage there so they're basically

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.050 
damage there so they're basically
useless<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:01.890> terms<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.520> bill<00:03:02.790> because

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
useless in terms of this bill because

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.550 
useless in terms of this bill because
you're<00:03:03.240> basically<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.020> putting<00:03:04.470> everything

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you're basically just putting everything

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're basically just putting everything
in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.950> charge<00:03:05.280> attack<00:03:05.810> basically<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.560> what

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
in the charge attack basically so what

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.900 
in the charge attack basically so what
I've<00:03:07.800> done<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.310> kind<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.550> went<00:03:08.730> raw

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
I've done is just kind of went raw

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
I've done is just kind of went raw
damage<00:03:09.240> like<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:10.230> pressure<00:03:10.470> point<00:03:10.830> under

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
damage like with pressure point under

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.490 
damage like with pressure point under
20%<00:03:11.490> extra<00:03:11.760> damage<00:03:12.030> spoils<00:03:12.630> strike<00:03:12.870> 100%

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
20% extra damage spoils strike 100%

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
20% extra damage spoils strike 100%
damage<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:14.190> course<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.459> get<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.580> minus<00:03:14.850> 20%

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
damage of course you get the minus 20%

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.500 
damage of course you get the minus 20%
attack<00:03:15.570> which<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> mitigate<00:03:16.140> with<00:03:16.470> fury<00:03:16.770> um

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
attack which you mitigate with fury um

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.090 
attack which you mitigate with fury um
if<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.660> don't<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.140> fury<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.769> really

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
if you don't have the fury on you really

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
if you don't have the fury on you really
feel<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.730> weapon<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.390> slow<00:03:21.750> that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
feel it like the weapon is so slow that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
feel it like the weapon is so slow that
it<00:03:22.080> takes<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.440> forever<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.160> throw

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it takes like forever to get your throw

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.570 
it takes like forever to get your throw
off<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.450> even<00:03:25.410> though<00:03:25.560> you're<00:03:25.769> focusing<00:03:26.130> on

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
off so even though you're focusing on

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.860 
off so even though you're focusing on
that<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.850> definitely<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.330> you're<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.600> also

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that you definitely if you're and also

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.390 
that you definitely if you're and also
you<00:03:28.080> get<00:03:28.230> around<00:03:28.530> faster<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.220> like

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
you get around faster you can do like

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.390 
you get around faster you can do like
the<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.120> Copts<00:03:30.390> ring<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.810> stuff<00:03:30.989> so

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
the the Copts ring and stuff so

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.650 
the the Copts ring and stuff so
regardless<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.640> definitely<00:03:33.030> need<00:03:33.150> Fury<00:03:33.480> even

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
regardless you definitely need Fury even

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.320 
regardless you definitely need Fury even
though<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.870> got<00:03:34.019> nerfed<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.910> after<00:03:36.239> that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
though it got nerfed and then after that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.759 
though it got nerfed and then after that
though<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.780> added<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.140> smite<00:03:37.440> Grenier

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
though I just added this smite Grenier

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.310 
though I just added this smite Grenier
for<00:03:38.010> 30%<00:03:38.310> damage<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.970> faction<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.540> that's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
for 30% damage to the faction and that's

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.170 
for 30% damage to the faction and that's
it<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.280> core<00:03:41.519> mods<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> guess

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
it just for the the core mods I guess

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000 
it just for the the core mods I guess
after<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.290> though<00:03:43.410> for<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> elemental

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
after that though for the elemental

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.340 
after that though for the elemental
combos<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.670> combined<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.390> focus<00:03:45.690> energy<00:03:46.050> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
combos I combined it focus energy and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.140 
combos I combined it focus energy and
molten<00:03:46.860> impact<00:03:47.220> which<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.430> electric<00:03:47.880> fire

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
molten impact which is electric fire

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.610 
molten impact which is electric fire
that<00:03:48.360> will<00:03:48.420> give<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.660> radiation<00:03:49.350> which<00:03:49.590> is

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
that will give you radiation which is

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.250 
that will give you radiation which is
great<00:03:50.010> against<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:51.239> Bombers<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.810> napalm<00:03:52.050> is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
great against the Bombers and napalm is

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870 
great against the Bombers and napalm is
basically<00:03:52.500> heavy<00:03:52.830> units<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> faction<00:03:53.730> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
basically heavy units of the faction and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.350 
basically heavy units of the faction and
I<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:54.870> focus<00:03:55.170> energy<00:03:55.320> on<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:55.769> still

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
I have focus energy on here still

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.180 
I have focus energy on here still
because<00:03:57.360> one<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.290> gives<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> same<00:03:58.920> amount

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
because one it gives you the same amount

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.990 
because one it gives you the same amount
of<00:03:59.310> damage<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.970> shocking<00:04:00.780> touch<00:04:01.110> gives<00:04:01.380> you

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
of damage that shocking touch gives you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.840 
of damage that shocking touch gives you
but<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:04.140> also<00:04:04.170> gives<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.040> 40%<00:04:05.370> channeling

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
but it also gives you the 40% channeling

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.400 
but it also gives you the 40% channeling
efficiency<00:04:06.209> which<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.420> still<00:04:06.810> good<00:04:07.019> if<00:04:07.260> you're

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
efficiency which is still good if you're

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.590 
efficiency which is still good if you're
doing<00:04:08.040> your<00:04:08.220> mailing<00:04:08.580> up<00:04:08.790> close<00:04:09.090> you'll<00:04:09.390> still

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
doing your mailing up close you'll still

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.030 
doing your mailing up close you'll still
be<00:04:09.750> pretty<00:04:10.080> good<00:04:10.230> damage<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.769> your<00:04:10.799> regular

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
be pretty good damage with your regular

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.880 
be pretty good damage with your regular
combos<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:11.820> instead<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.390> five<00:04:12.570> energy<00:04:12.750> b3<00:04:13.410> it's

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
combos so instead of five energy b3 it's

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.120 
combos so instead of five energy b3 it's
still<00:04:14.070> great<00:04:14.310> mod<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.090> basically<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
still great mod to have on basically and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.500 
still great mod to have on basically and
then<00:04:17.250> after<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.760> combined<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.120> north<00:04:18.299> wing

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
then after I just combined in north wing

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.150 
then after I just combined in north wing
with<00:04:18.720> fever<00:04:19.019> strike<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.799> gives<00:04:19.919> me<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
with fever strike that it gives me the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.159 
with fever strike that it gives me the
viral<00:04:20.459> combination<00:04:21.120> which<00:04:21.570> affects<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
viral combination which affects the

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.810 
viral combination which affects the
entire<00:04:22.410> faction<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> Grenadiers<00:04:23.580> well

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
entire faction of the Grenadiers well

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.240 
entire faction of the Grenadiers well
really<00:04:24.150> really<00:04:24.240> good<00:04:24.539> combo<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:26.070> it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
really really good combo and that's it

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.770 
really really good combo and that's it
for<00:04:26.370> them<00:04:26.520> pretty<00:04:26.820> straightforward

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
for them pretty straightforward

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.660 
for them pretty straightforward
move<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.170> corpus<00:04:28.560> though<00:04:28.770> corpus<00:04:29.460> what<00:04:29.610> I

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
move on the corpus though corpus what I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.730 
move on the corpus though corpus what I
did<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.030> built<00:04:30.330> focus<00:04:31.260> energy<00:04:31.530> with

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
did is I built focus energy with

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.379 
did is I built focus energy with
Northwind<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.340> will<00:04:32.430> give<00:04:32.550> me<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.820> magnetic

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
Northwind that will give me the magnetic

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.720 
Northwind that will give me the magnetic
which<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.990> basically<00:04:34.860> damage<00:04:35.280> against<00:04:35.610> their

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
which is basically damage against their

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.760 
which is basically damage against their
shields<00:04:36.180> which<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.450> really<00:04:36.660> good<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.530> also

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
shields which is really good and I also

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.409 
shields which is really good and I also
added<00:04:38.100> in<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.460> volt<00:04:38.730> voltage<00:04:39.180> strike<00:04:39.840> and

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
added in a volt voltage strike and

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.720 
added in a volt voltage strike and
basically<00:04:42.419> this<00:04:42.600> is<00:04:42.660> still<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.080> Cicero<00:04:43.770> event

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
basically this is still a Cicero event

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.240 
basically this is still a Cicero event

mod exclusive so if you're new to the
game<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.550> won't<00:04:47.669> have<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.090> mod

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
game you won't have this mod

unfortunately<00:04:49.650> these<00:04:49.800> haven't<00:04:50.160> added<00:04:50.430> into

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
unfortunately these haven't added into

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
unfortunately these haven't added into
the<00:04:50.700> game<00:04:50.730> Jenna<00:04:51.060> I'm<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.360> hoping<00:04:51.510> they

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
the game Jenna I'm really hoping they

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.140 
the game Jenna I'm really hoping they
can<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.800> basically<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.820> reason<00:04:54.030> why<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
can do so but basically the reason why I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.190 
can do so but basically the reason why I
have<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:56.240> like<00:04:57.240> if<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.080> don't

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
have this is like if you if you don't

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.600 
have this is like if you if you don't
have<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.710> would<00:04:58.800> use<00:04:58.950> shocking<00:04:59.370> touch

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
have it you would use shocking touch

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.320 
have it you would use shocking touch
which<00:04:59.850> is<00:04:59.880> basically<00:05:00.240> 11<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:00.840> 60%<00:05:02.180> but<00:05:03.180> this

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
which is basically 11 for 60% but this

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.150 
which is basically 11 for 60% but this
one<00:05:03.540> just<00:05:03.750> gives<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.110> 60%<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:04.980> also

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
one just gives you the 60% but also

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.690 
one just gives you the 60% but also
gives<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.460> 60<00:05:05.730> percent<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.090> 2<00:05:06.419> status<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:07.700> so

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
gives you 60 percent of 2 status so so

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.770 
gives you 60 percent of 2 status so so
yeah<00:05:08.820> that's<00:05:09.030> why<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> use<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.480> but<00:05:09.630> if<00:05:09.720> you

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
yeah that's why I use it but if you

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.270 
yeah that's why I use it but if you
don't<00:05:09.900> have<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.140> use<00:05:10.290> shocking<00:05:10.710> touch<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:11.100> guess

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
don't have it use shocking touch I guess

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.850 
don't have it use shocking touch I guess
after<00:05:11.700> that<00:05:12.120> smite<00:05:12.510> corpus<00:05:12.930> for<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.380> faction

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
after that smite corpus for the faction

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.480 
after that smite corpus for the faction
and<00:05:14.730> then<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.450> have<00:05:15.630> poison<00:05:16.200> on<00:05:16.320> here<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:17.190> give

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
and then I have poison on here to give

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.070 
and then I have poison on here to give
give<00:05:17.820> some<00:05:18.000> poison<00:05:18.360> damage<00:05:18.600> which<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:18.840> really

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
give some poison damage which is really

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.570 
give some poison damage which is really
good<00:05:19.200> against<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.560> corpus<00:05:19.950> as<00:05:20.100> well<00:05:20.280> like<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
good against the corpus as well like the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.370 
good against the corpus as well like the
flesh<00:05:20.790> units<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.270> stuff<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:22.140> that's<00:05:22.260> how

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
flesh units and stuff so that's how

though so for infested now basically
what<00:05:33.690> I've<00:05:33.780> done<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.370> focus<00:05:35.370> energy<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:36.090> fever

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
what I've done is focus energy and fever

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.760 
what I've done is focus energy and fever
strike<00:05:36.660> will<00:05:36.810> give<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.020> your<00:05:37.169> corrosive

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
strike will give you your corrosive

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
which is good against the ancients and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.960 
which is good against the ancients and

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
of the damage mods though I actually

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.710 
of the damage mods though I actually
added<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.430> jagged<00:05:50.910> edge<00:05:51.030> here<00:05:51.300> because<00:05:51.450> the

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
added in jagged edge here because the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.719 
added in jagged edge here because the
weapon<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.080> high<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.680> slash<00:05:52.979> so<00:05:53.250> this<00:05:53.430> will

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
weapon is high in slash so this will

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.940 
weapon is high in slash so this will
give<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.060> really<00:05:54.870> good<00:05:55.020> damage<00:05:55.560> against

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
the cold damages for the shielded

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.550 
the cold damages for the shielded
targets<00:06:21.450> like<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.780> fusion<00:06:21.990> moans<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.470> the
