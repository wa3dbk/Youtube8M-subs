00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 is 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.849
 Hello this year, I want to show you how to file in Gemen 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 can curb or 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.179
 why it would be useful to add endings to this file 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.310
 to show 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.140
 our own recent time again and again Malysz percent are due 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 have shown on our video how they can use the desktop 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.699
 Come back in the desktop viewing icon 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.800
 and there you can sing the files and the FC Memmingen Runs 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 In any case, that would be written with the editor and the titleholder 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.530
 befitting TXT as file extension 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.500
 Neubauer at SF 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130
 or SCF times SVC I think so 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.560
 No matter now we are a different team in any case children themselves 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.900
 to always a text fal 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.940
 The percentage of founders is actually quite simple the Dirt 3 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.050
 changes 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.230
 Waldmann is wrong, that's not wrong, everything could change that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.680
 rename but is not so far 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 Show an example to a pool I'll get her the one he conducts 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.470
 we just got in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.850
 I'm going to save it on «File» 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 says Desktop without 10 Sion once RTF format 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.650
 that means it is in rtf- 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.080
 saved Bente files and RCF unit just put them in 12 instead of document 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.660
 OK does not mean saying mate 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 Save appears on the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.740
 RTF document 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450
 now without healing but not counting why Oliver Wyman standard 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.350
 According to the winning US, they are hidden in Windows Vista 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 are they in Essex b or are they of course also in Windows 7 or Suter 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 I also do not know why this is so in the future versions 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.770
 Isny 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.330
 all in my opinion 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.670
 are mere 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.610
 unique 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.240
 go right-click and then seen as here 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.040
 he has the current he has 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.930
 and that is in principle also our Andoni 10 I do not have the ending 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.550
 Szczecin Linz where one moves in there 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.810
 that is not set that is displayed 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.530
 and that without him soon show they can change or I want them 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 say Rome is useful to change that is explorer 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.489
 and in Windows experts also had the advantage that they are up 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.710
 the menu bar trunk akvis should be embedded 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.629
 at XP 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.620
 Bold at Vista and up to 7 but you have to press the alt key so this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.759
 Solution probably ice cream parlor comes refer to the menu bar 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.759
 and we must definitely look into the options 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.629
 under extras who this is whether nations 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.279
 Dan under view 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.769
 gives the point extensions known 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.649
 or with known lasting effects 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.769
 The squat end must be at Schechter one of the data must not be a green hook 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.939
 his 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.729
 then he does not call it all 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.759
 concluded that the file types are displayed but not displayed 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.039
 if now all self-confidence and say yes I want all the scenes 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.109
 they can then remove me then even then everything will be 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.959
 displayed or want to remove 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.009
 comes and the message 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.689
 The country has poured system files as system and offer 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.499
 Stands hideout marked 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.499
 were or will be displayed in six blocks 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.459
 you can now pull it with yes 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.370
 to confirm 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.299
 that knows us one is then but 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.069
 at no risk that you changed something 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.389
 we say take over and now one thing stands out when he returns to ours 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.639
 Dock will not look more testy with them 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.749
 but test comes RTF 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.689
 Now we have our file change 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.089
 PS my naked look in the properties and we see also behind 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.049
 this separation is clearly the filename 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.140
 if you want to rename a file now rename right-click 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.839
 and lo and behold, XP is writing because it's expensive in the text 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.189
 want to have 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.349
 say okay then and here messages settled Thayer will change changes 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.499
 the three millionth unusable with lush nonetheless year on year 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.459
 and now we have a tête-à-tête document in the Veiel gates 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.809
 if I do it the normal way 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.339
 what texts but 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.679
 Under Extras autopsy view and you left the hook of the known parts 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.729
 hide irritated says take over there so logically disappears 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.829
 Animal party extension again 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.969
 if rename now says 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.840
 Point RTF 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 how was scrolling the case then that does not work it just shows off 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.010
 the name Isele Muckle but not just renamed 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.590
 with Dr 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.520
 File extension 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.189
 a door with the attractive ads 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.090
 now must be set under view 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.650
 then she does not realize where the mistake lies 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.449
 we do not have the file ending Gander here for the poor only 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.590
 and 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.250
 that is also the big mistake the neighbor man makes and if they are here 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.319
 Iran has somehow wanted to change things 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.849
 I have with the video I have shown him now 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.930
 what they have to do if the mistake comes up 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.750
 and I'm sure I've saved me some emails that I called 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.050
 has been 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.400
 Keeps that was should there be questions because it seems to us at the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.720
 Winter testing areas live or in our forum or simply via YouTube message 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.639
 send 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.659
 there you have to 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.059
 Morten Olsen 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.080
 the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.650
