actually<00:00:16.660> show<00:00:16.900> you<00:00:16.960> LEGO<00:00:17.410> sets<00:00:17.680> tell<00:00:18.640> you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
actually show you LEGO sets tell you

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.360 
actually show you LEGO sets tell you
about<00:00:18.850> them<00:00:19.180> tell<00:00:19.420> you<00:00:19.480> what<00:00:19.510> we<00:00:19.720> think<00:00:19.990> and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
about them tell you what we think and

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.040 
about them tell you what we think and
hopefully<00:00:21.370> we<00:00:21.730> all<00:00:21.880> learn<00:00:22.210> something<00:00:22.240> as<00:00:22.900> we

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
hopefully we all learn something as we

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
hopefully we all learn something as we
look<00:00:23.200> at<00:00:23.380> it<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:25.300> today<00:00:25.660> we<00:00:25.870> got<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.070> orient

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.110 
featured on Lego element a li in the
future<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:12.010> let's<00:01:12.220> take<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.430> closer<00:01:12.730> look<00:01:12.850> at

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
future so let's take a closer look at

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.020 
future so let's take a closer look at
this<00:01:13.270> set<00:01:14.160> alright<00:01:15.160> first<00:01:15.400> we'll<00:01:15.610> look<00:01:15.790> at<00:01:15.910> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
this set alright first we'll look at the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.240 
this set alright first we'll look at the
box<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.780> instructions<00:01:17.380> which<00:01:17.590> typically

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
box and the instructions which typically

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.030 
box and the instructions which typically
on<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.520> adventurer<00:01:19.180> sets<00:01:19.480> they<00:01:19.720> have<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.770> map

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
on the adventurer sets they have the map

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.200 
on the adventurer sets they have the map
found<00:01:21.760> here<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.650> shows<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.890> river<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:25.000> does

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
found here and shows the river that does

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.050 
found here and shows the river that does
not<00:01:25.360> come<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.870> jungle<00:01:26.260> River<00:01:26.440> sit<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.910> on

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
not come in the jungle River sit and on

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
not come in the jungle River sit and on
the<00:01:28.150> back<00:01:28.330> again<00:01:28.810> we<00:01:28.960> see<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> map<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.870> main

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
the back again we see a map and the main

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.340 
the back again we see a map and the main
model<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.920> some<00:01:33.160> other<00:01:33.310> little<00:01:33.550> things<00:01:33.670> built

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
model and some other little things built

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.600 
model and some other little things built
from<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> main<00:01:35.620> model<00:01:35.860> I<00:01:36.160> should<00:01:36.460> say

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
from the main model I should say

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.260 
from the main model I should say
and<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.960> instructions<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.740> similar<00:01:41.370> you're

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and the instructions are similar you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.550 
and the instructions are similar you're
looking<00:01:42.660> at<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> map<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.900> then<00:01:45.900> map<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
looking at a map and then map on the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.230 
looking at a map and then map on the
back<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:47.100> Johnny<00:01:47.310> Thunder<00:01:47.730> and<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.910> different

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
back with Johnny Thunder and a different

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.540 
back with Johnny Thunder and a different
outfit<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.350> shows<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:50.010> some<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
outfit and it shows you some of the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.490 
outfit and it shows you some of the
different<00:01:50.880> sets<00:01:51.120> which<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.780> most<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.260> sets

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
different sets which so most of the sets

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
different sets which so most of the sets
came<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.130> game<00:01:53.340> cards<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.540> being<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.080> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
came with game cards this being one the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.960 
came with game cards this being one the
smaller<00:01:55.500> sets<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.100> did<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.340> come<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.640> game

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
smaller sets it did not come with game

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.180 
smaller sets it did not come with game
cards<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.110> shows<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.830> on<00:01:59.010> this

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
cards it actually shows you here on this

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.700 
cards it actually shows you here on this
map<00:01:59.610> in<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.480> instruction<00:02:00.930> manual<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> sets

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
map in the instruction manual the sets

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.250 
map in the instruction manual the sets
that<00:02:01.830> have<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> game<00:02:02.460> cards<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.360> they're
