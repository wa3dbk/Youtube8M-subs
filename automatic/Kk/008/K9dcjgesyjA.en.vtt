00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.530
 hello today we are going to make these pretty 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.500
 lamps and we're going to use a shooter 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.960
 of door and we will use accounts 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 transparent but at home if so 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 they wish they can also use accounts 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.280
 of colors or also covers I go to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.040
 put a little bit of glue and then 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 I'm going to use an account, or in my case 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.430
 I'm going to use three accounts to make 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 my lamp since I'm going to make a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 small lamp but the number of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.050
 accounts that you are going to use depends 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.600
 clear of the size of your wrist and also 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.780
 of the type of lamp you want to make and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 after this I will put the lining of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.190
 cupcake on top of the lamp and that's it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.740
 all 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.370
 here we have photos of the lamps already 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.370
 completed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 and good the doll that they just saw in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 screen is this fashionista barbie that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.759
 it's a new barbie that went on the market 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.920
 and I bought it since it looked a lot like 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.310
 to cleo and it also looks a little bit like 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 me and that's why I liked it so much and so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 I'm going to show you a little bit more closely 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
 it's the doll here in the middle but there 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 in that line different types of doll 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 with different kinds of colors shoes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.360
 etc. here we have the doll and how 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.659
 can see has a little face a little 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.880
 Asian and also has the arms that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.220
 they have joints and legs that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 they have joints too and that's why 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.649
 I liked it a lot because it's so easy 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.259
 to lay it down and put them in different 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.200
 poses already when you're not taking pictures and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.200
