00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
problem is I think with most people it's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
problem is I think with most people it's
mindset<00:00:33.680> they<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:34.890> approach<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
job they don't approach it like a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.440 
job they don't approach it like a
business<00:00:36.899> opportunity<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.090> because<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.329> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
business opportunity and because in this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
give it a try for six months and see if

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.800 
give it a try for six months and see if
it<00:01:32.549> works<00:01:32.790> where<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> saying<00:01:33.659> obviously

it works where what you saying obviously

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
it works where what you saying obviously
his<00:01:34.140> people<00:01:34.470> wouldn't<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
his people wouldn't do that in a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
his people wouldn't do that in a
franchise<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> wouldn't<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.479> i'll<00:01:36.960> put

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
franchise you wouldn't say i'll put

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
franchise you wouldn't say i'll put
fifty<00:01:37.770> thousand<00:01:38.159> dollars<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.490> i'll<00:01:38.610> try<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
fifty thousand dollars then i'll try it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
fifty thousand dollars then i'll try it
for<00:01:39.030> six<00:01:39.180> months<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.500> are

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
for six months and so they really are

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560 
for six months and so they really are
setting<00:01:41.430> themselves<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:41.970> failure<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
setting themselves up for failure in a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
themselves up for failure and again it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.389

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
style of multi-level marketing you would

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.220 
style of multi-level marketing you would
sign<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.819> as<00:02:33.000> many<00:02:33.330> people<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> could<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
sign up as many people as you could and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
sign up as many people as you could and
hope<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.769> one<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.040> them<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.910> out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
hope that one of them would then go out

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.540 
hope that one of them would then go out
and<00:02:36.360> make<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.140> incredibly<00:02:37.440> wealthy<00:02:38.220> which

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
it's not like that now I think how he

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960 
it's not like that now I think how he
put<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.380> when<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.590> sponsor<00:02:41.099> someone<00:02:41.580> now

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
put it was when you sponsor someone now

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.199 
put it was when you sponsor someone now
you<00:02:42.959> actually<00:02:43.410> go<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> work<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.069> them<00:02:44.250> exactly

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
you actually go to work for them exactly

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.080 
you actually go to work for them exactly
and<00:02:45.530> that's<00:02:46.530> again<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.430> has<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and that's again that has to do with the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.199 
and that's again that has to do with the
training<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.630> has<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> mentoring

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
training it has to do with the mentoring

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.370 
training it has to do with the mentoring
that<00:02:51.209> that's<00:02:51.630> some<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.989> stuff<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.170> we
