a<00:00:08.099> different<00:00:08.429> story<00:00:08.670> if<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.059> south

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
a different story if you're in the south

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.690 
a different story if you're in the south
coast<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> interior<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.040> hot<00:00:11.370> we're

coast and the interior it is hot we're

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.100 
coast and the interior it is hot we're
looking<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.059> temperatures<00:00:12.480> into<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> mid<00:00:12.990> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
looking at temperatures into the mid to

upper 30s especially interior sections
of<00:00:15.150> BC<00:00:15.450> you'll<00:00:15.570> cool<00:00:15.780> down<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.020> little<00:00:16.379> bit<00:00:16.590> as

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
of BC you'll cool down a little bit as

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769 
of BC you'll cool down a little bit as
we<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.279> closer<00:00:17.550> towards<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> weekend<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
we get closer towards the weekend and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
we get closer towards the weekend and
then<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.140> an<00:00:19.560> upper-level<00:00:20.130> trough<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
then we do have an upper-level trough in

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.000 
then we do have an upper-level trough in
place<00:00:21.029> across<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.990> Eastern<00:00:22.410> Canada<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
place across really Eastern Canada and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.080 
place across really Eastern Canada and
that's<00:00:23.160> why<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.490> seeing<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.970> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that's why we're seeing all this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330 
that's why we're seeing all this
activity<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.840> parts<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.529> Ontario<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.160> let's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
activity in parts of Ontario so let's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.130 
activity in parts of Ontario so let's
just<00:00:26.550> zoom<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.570> cold<00:00:27.810> front<00:00:28.050> has

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
just zoom it right in the cold front has

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
just zoom it right in the cold front has
passed<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.609> still<00:00:29.849> looking<00:00:29.910> at

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
within all this rain and unfortunately

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.130 
within all this rain and unfortunately
especially<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.570> us<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.809> southern<00:00:40.050> Ontario

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
especially for us in southern Ontario

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
especially for us in southern Ontario
Cheryl<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.370> didn't<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:42.030> rain<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.420> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
Cheryl we didn't get as much rain as we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
Cheryl we didn't get as much rain as we
thought<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.489> see

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
thought we would but we are going to see

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
thought we would but we are going to see
more<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.210> off<00:00:45.420> showers<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> day

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
more on off showers through the day

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
more on off showers through the day
tomorrow<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.770> hopefully<00:00:47.579> it'll<00:00:48.059> give<00:00:48.270> all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
tomorrow so hopefully it'll give all

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
tomorrow so hopefully it'll give all
that<00:00:48.629> brown<00:00:48.930> grass<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.770> opportunity<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.670> turn

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that brown grass an opportunity to turn

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
that brown grass an opportunity to turn
green<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.320> would<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.590> great<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.340> know

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
green that would be great and you know

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.799 
green that would be great and you know
that<00:00:53.610> front<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.270> came<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> little

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that front actually came in a little

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
that front actually came in a little
sooner<00:00:55.469> than<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.920> thought<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
sooner than we thought as well with the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
sooner than we thought as well with the
forecast<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.050> largely<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.070> are

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
forecast so I think that largely we are

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
forecast so I think that largely we are
through<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.730> thunderstorm<00:01:00.030> risk<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
through with that thunderstorm risk in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
through with that thunderstorm risk in
southern<00:01:01.379> Ontario<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> north
