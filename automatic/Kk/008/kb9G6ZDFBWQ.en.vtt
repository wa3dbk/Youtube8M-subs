this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.840> quick<00:00:01.260> tutorial<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.740> how<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:02.070> fill

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
this is a quick tutorial on how to fill

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.650 
this is a quick tutorial on how to fill
the<00:00:03.270> fisher-price<00:00:04.040> aquarium<00:00:05.359> when<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.450> first

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
the fisher-price aquarium when we first

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.169 
the fisher-price aquarium when we first
received<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.140> as<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.410> gift<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.490> water<00:00:08.849> level

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
received this as a gift the water level

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.390 
received this as a gift the water level
was<00:00:09.360> about<00:00:09.630> Oh<00:00:09.900> almost<00:00:10.860> at<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.070> top<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
was about Oh almost at the top of the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.370 
was about Oh almost at the top of the
fish<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.790> then<00:00:12.090> after<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> little<00:00:12.690> while<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
fish and then after a little while I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.839 
fish and then after a little while I
guess<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.830> water<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.190> evaporated<00:00:14.730> and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
guess the water just evaporated and

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.689 
guess the water just evaporated and
ended<00:00:15.150> up<00:00:15.179> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> bottom<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> fish<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.250> um

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
ended up at the bottom of the fish so um

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.150 
ended up at the bottom of the fish so um
I<00:00:18.359> figured<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.770> haven't<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
I figured you know we haven't had it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.410 
I figured you know we haven't had it
that<00:00:20.279> long<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.640> don't<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.060> rid<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
that long I don't want to get rid of it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.700 
that long I don't want to get rid of it
so<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:23.160> took<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.670> apart<00:00:26.060> okay<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.590> what

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so I took it apart okay this is what

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
so I took it apart okay this is what
you're<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> back<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.539> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you're going to see in the back when you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.170 
you're going to see in the back when you
take<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> apart<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.009> basically<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.969> over

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
take it apart so basically this over

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.500 
take it apart so basically this over
here

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
here

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.160 
here
that's<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> pump<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
that's the pump and that's what is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
that's the pump and that's what is
taking<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> air<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.829> putting<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> through<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
taking the air and putting it through so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
taking the air and putting it through so
you<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> bubbles<00:00:39.809> come<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.500> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you have the bubbles come up when it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.170 
you have the bubbles come up when it's
playing<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
playing so what you're going to want to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
playing so what you're going to want to
do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.629> want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.840> disconnect

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
do is you're going to want to disconnect

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
do is you're going to want to disconnect
the<00:00:43.350> hose<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> top<00:00:44.579> side

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the hose here which is on the top side

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
the hose here which is on the top side
of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> pump<00:00:45.170> I'm<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> take<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> glass<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of the pump I'm going to take a glass of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.729 
of the pump I'm going to take a glass of
water<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.050> you're<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> take

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
water and then you're just going to take

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
water and then you're just going to take
the<00:00:50.010> hose<00:00:50.690> once<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.870> disconnected<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.710> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the hose once it's disconnected put in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
the hose once it's disconnected put in
the<00:00:52.920> water<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> turn<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> on

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the water you're going to turn it on

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
the water you're going to turn it on
with<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> hose<00:00:55.649> inside<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.370> basically<00:00:56.760> you're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
with the hose inside so basically you're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
with the hose inside so basically you're
going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> turn<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.039> like<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.340> you're

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to turn this like a lot you're

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
going to turn this like a lot you're
going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> press<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:01.289> blue<00:01:01.829> button

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
going to press that little blue button

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
going to press that little blue button
at<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> bottom<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.789> turns<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> when

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
at the bottom which turns it on so when

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.840 
at the bottom which turns it on so when
you<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.360> hold<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.860> when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you do that hold on when you do that you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.719 
you do that hold on when you do that you
can<00:01:09.030> hear<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> music<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> pump<00:01:10.229> going

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
can hear the music and the pump going

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
can hear the music and the pump going
basically<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.570> full<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.930> vision<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically if this was full of vision you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
basically if this was full of vision you
could<00:01:13.710> feel<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.159> suction<00:01:14.369> heat<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.119> air

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
could feel the suction heat little air

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
could feel the suction heat little air
being<00:01:15.750> sucked<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.430> glass<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
being sucked in so when the glass is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
being sucked in so when the glass is
brought<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> suck<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.350> water

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
brought up it's going to suck in water

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
brought up it's going to suck in water
now<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.610> sure<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.759> you're<00:01:21.000> filling<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> up

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
now make sure when you're filling it up

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.929 
now make sure when you're filling it up
that<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.049> fill<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.470> too<00:01:22.890> much

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
that you don't fill it up too much

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
that you don't fill it up too much
reason<00:01:23.939> being<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.840> need<00:01:24.990> air<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
reason being is you do need air at the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770 
reason being is you do need air at the
top<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.880> needs<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> grab<00:01:27.390> air<00:01:27.630> from

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
top because it needs to grab air from

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
top because it needs to grab air from
somewhere<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.710> blow<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> bubbles<00:01:29.430> inside<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
somewhere to blow the bubbles inside and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
somewhere to blow the bubbles inside and
then<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.220> done<00:01:32.250> you're<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
then once you're done you're just going

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
then once you're done you're just going
to<00:01:33.090> take<00:01:33.270> some<00:01:34.049> all-purpose<00:01:34.470> silicon<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to take some all-purpose silicon and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
to take some all-purpose silicon and
silicon<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.939> it'll<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
silicon this back up and it'll do the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
silicon this back up and it'll do the
job<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.049> basically<00:01:40.560> how<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.920> fill<00:01:42.950> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
job so that's basically how you fill it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.139 
job so that's basically how you fill it
this<00:01:44.130> basically<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.700> feel

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
this basically how you feel
