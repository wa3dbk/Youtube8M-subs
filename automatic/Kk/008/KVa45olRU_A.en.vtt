we're going to be talking about the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.799 
we're going to be talking about the
Nikon<00:00:12.630> speed<00:00:13.230> light<00:00:13.790> sb-700<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.420> right

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Nikon speed light sb-700 and it's right

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
Nikon speed light sb-700 and it's right
here<00:00:16.230> now<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.920> speed<00:00:17.220> light<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
here now this speed light is one of the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.170 
here now this speed light is one of the
newest<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> Nikon's<00:00:19.289> lineup<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.939> made

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
newest in Nikon's lineup and it is made

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.300 
newest in Nikon's lineup and it is made
to<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> fully<00:00:21.810> functioning<00:00:22.439> pro<00:00:22.830> speed

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
to be a fully functioning pro speed

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.620 
to be a fully functioning pro speed
light<00:00:23.519> that's<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> break<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> bank

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
light that's not going to break the bank

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.509 
light that's not going to break the bank
so<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> three<00:00:25.949> hundred<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.310> thirty

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so this is a three hundred and thirty

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 
so this is a three hundred and thirty
dollar<00:00:26.820> speed<00:00:27.359> light<00:00:27.599> which<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> an

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
dollar speed light which is an

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
dollar speed light which is an
exceptional<00:00:29.189> value<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.330> let<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.510> go

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
exceptional value and so let me go

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.820 
exceptional value and so let me go
through<00:00:30.660> some<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> features<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.710> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
through some of the features of this so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.870 
through some of the features of this so
I'm<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> slide<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.610> camera

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I'm going to slide this on my camera

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
I'm going to slide this on my camera
here<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.180> lock<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.600> now<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> has<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
here and lock it on now this has a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
here and lock it on now this has a
normal<00:00:35.219> flash<00:00:35.820> head<00:00:36.090> positioning<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
normal flash head positioning that you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.030 
normal flash head positioning that you
would<00:00:36.870> expect<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.559> bounce<00:00:37.770> things

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
would expect so you can bounce things

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
would expect so you can bounce things
off<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.670> ceiling<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> rotate<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
off the ceiling and you can rotate this

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.130 
off the ceiling and you can rotate this
and<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:41.070> anything<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.460> need<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.930> bounce

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and do anything you need to do to bounce

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.049 
and do anything you need to do to bounce
the<00:00:43.379> light<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.950> functionality<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> there

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the light so that functionality is there

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
the light so that functionality is there
just<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.780> expect<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.289> even<00:00:46.559> has

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
just as you would expect and it even has

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
just as you would expect and it even has
this<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.039> trick<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.760> pop<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this little trick where you can pop this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
this little trick where you can pop this
down<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.200> step<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.860> tell<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> flash<00:00:50.399> hey

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
down a little step to tell the flash hey

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.069 
down a little step to tell the flash hey
I'm<00:00:50.789> shooting<00:00:51.059> something<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.629> close<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I'm shooting something really close and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
I'm shooting something really close and
so<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.379> blast<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.489> you've<00:00:53.699> got

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so don't blast it out so you've got

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
so don't blast it out so you've got
things<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> would<00:00:54.899> expect

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
things like that that you would expect

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
things like that that you would expect
in<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> speedlight<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.370> caliber<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> also

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
in a speedlight of this caliber and also

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
in a speedlight of this caliber and also
it<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.020> used<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> transmitter<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it can be used as a transmitter or a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.080 
it can be used as a transmitter or a
receiver<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:01.469> control<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> two<00:01:02.430> groups<00:01:02.820> if

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
receiver to control up to two groups if

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.910 
receiver to control up to two groups if
it's<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> commander<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.439> part<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's in a commander or it can be part of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
it's in a commander or it can be part of
three<00:01:05.159> groups<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
three groups if it's one of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
three groups if it's one of the
receivers<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:07.890> you've<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.250> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
receivers so over here you've got this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
receivers so over here you've got this
little<00:01:08.610> switch<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.180> says<00:01:09.360> remote<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.080> master

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
little switch that says remote or master

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.620 
little switch that says remote or master
and<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> master<00:01:11.580> mode<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.090> control<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and so in master mode you can control to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.359 
and so in master mode you can control to
two<00:01:12.780> groups<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> remote<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
two groups or if it's in a remote you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
two groups or if it's in a remote you
can<00:01:14.430> join<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.390> groups<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.960> speed

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
can join one of three groups of speed

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
can join one of three groups of speed
lights<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.090> nice<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.360> those

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
lights and so it's really nice for those

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
lights and so it's really nice for those
of<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.320> need<00:01:19.680> something<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.310> an

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of you that just need something as an

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.609 
of you that just need something as an
additional<00:01:21.030> remote<00:01:21.780> speed<00:01:22.110> light<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
additional remote speed light this is a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
additional remote speed light this is a
great<00:01:23.100> option<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> other

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
great option for that now the other

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
great option for that now the other
thing<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.830> switch<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.850> on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
thing is there is a switch right here on

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
thing is there is a switch right here on
the<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.259> allows<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> do

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the side and what that allows you to do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
the side and what that allows you to do
is<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> choose<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.670> three<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:29.970> light

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is to choose from three different light

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
is to choose from three different light
distribution<00:01:31.380> patterns<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.030> little

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
distribution patterns and so this little

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
distribution patterns and so this little
switch<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> slider<00:01:34.590> allows

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
switch over here on the slider allows

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
switch over here on the slider allows
you<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> choose<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> three<00:01:36.990> things

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you to choose from one of three things

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
you to choose from one of three things
so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> standard<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.630> general

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so you can have standard for general

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
so you can have standard for general
illumination<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
illumination which is right there or you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
illumination which is right there or you
can<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.630> center-weighted<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
can have a center-weighted which is this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.380 
can have a center-weighted which is this
next<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.090> great<00:01:45.329> for

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
next one down and that's great for

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
next one down and that's great for
portraits<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.390> down

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
portraits and then we have this one down

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
portraits and then we have this one down
here<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.399> great<00:01:50.729> for

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here which is even and that's great for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
here which is even and that's great for
groups<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.810> interiors<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.040> sort<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> tells

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
groups or interiors so it sort of tells

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.830 
groups or interiors so it sort of tells
you<00:01:53.729> how<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> light<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> be

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you how the light is going to be

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
you how the light is going to be
distributed<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.340> nice

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
distributed which is a really nice

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.679 
distributed which is a really nice
feature<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.479> go

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
feature and again you can just just go

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.910 
feature and again you can just just go
right<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.140> flip<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.469> switch<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
right in there and flip that switch and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
right in there and flip that switch and
get<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.759> setting<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> want

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
get right to the setting that you want

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.300 
get right to the setting that you want
without<00:02:01.140> having<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> dig<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.950> bunch<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
without having to dig into a bunch of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.889 
without having to dig into a bunch of
menus<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.299> nice<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> helps<00:02:03.840> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
menus which is really nice and helps you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.020 
menus which is really nice and helps you
do<00:02:04.020> things<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:04.469> quickly<00:02:04.979> now<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> other

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
do things really quickly now the other

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730 
do things really quickly now the other
thing<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.600> flash<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.680> in

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
thing that this flash has and it's in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
thing that this flash has and it's in
the<00:02:07.860> bag<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.000> all

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the bag here that I really like all

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
the bag here that I really like all
these<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.810> goodies<00:02:10.170> right<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.920> let's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
these little goodies right here so let's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.380 
these little goodies right here so let's
say<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.310> example<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.360> need<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> balance

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
say for example that you need to balance

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.030 
say for example that you need to balance
you<00:02:13.450> flash<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.200> color<00:02:14.410> temperature<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.890> this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
you flash the color temperature of this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.820 
you flash the color temperature of this
flash<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.480> nice<00:02:16.990> tungsten<00:02:17.470> light<00:02:17.650> well

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
flash to a nice tungsten light well

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.190 
flash to a nice tungsten light well
here's<00:02:18.100> an<00:02:18.400> Amber<00:02:18.760> gel<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.750> will<00:02:19.959> just

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
here's an Amber gel and that will just

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.559 
here's an Amber gel and that will just
pop<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> front<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.450> like

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
pop right on the front of this just like

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.199 
pop right on the front of this just like
that<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.410> trick<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.120> this

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
that now the trick with this is and this

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.180 
that now the trick with this is and this
is<00:02:25.270> something<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.750> really<00:02:25.959> love<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.860> bottom

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
is something I really love on the bottom

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.400 
is something I really love on the bottom
of<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.430> flash<00:02:27.850> there<00:02:28.810> are<00:02:28.990> these<00:02:29.140> little

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
of this flash there are these little

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.130 
of this flash there are these little
tabs<00:02:29.860> down<00:02:30.220> here<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.330> when<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.570> pops<00:02:31.870> on

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
tabs down here and so when this pops on

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.800 
tabs down here and so when this pops on
it<00:02:32.470> pushes<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.160> certain<00:02:34.090> combination<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.720> those

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it pushes a certain combination of those

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.380 
it pushes a certain combination of those
tabs<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:35.680> tells<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.160> flash<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.270> has

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
tabs and it tells the flash that it has

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.510 
tabs and it tells the flash that it has
an<00:02:37.600> Amber<00:02:37.959> gel<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.010> tells<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
an Amber gel and then it tells the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.910 
an Amber gel and then it tells the
camera<00:02:40.209> well<00:02:40.570> hey<00:02:40.780> my<00:02:40.989> color<00:02:41.260> temperature<00:02:41.739> of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
camera well hey my color temperature of

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.820 
camera well hey my color temperature of
this<00:02:42.010> flash<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:42.850> 3800<00:02:43.600> Kelvin<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.709> it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
this flash is now 3800 Kelvin and so it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.800 
this flash is now 3800 Kelvin and so it
makes<00:02:45.010> sure<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.459> white<00:02:45.670> balance<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.209> set

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
makes sure that the white balance is set

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
makes sure that the white balance is set
to<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.140> correct<00:02:47.440> color<00:02:47.860> temperature<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.489> so

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to the correct color temperature and so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
to the correct color temperature and so
everything<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.800> looking<00:02:50.800> good<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.340> you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
everything is looking good and so you

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.770 
everything is looking good and so you
can<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:51.580> do<00:02:51.910> all<00:02:51.940> your<00:02:52.180> color<00:02:52.360> management

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
can just do all your color management

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.180 
can just do all your color management
that<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.350> same<00:02:53.560> thing<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:54.040> you're

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that way the same thing is if you're

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.520 
that way the same thing is if you're
shooting<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.630> maybe<00:02:55.630> florescent<00:02:56.140> lights<00:02:56.320> it

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
shooting with maybe florescent lights it

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.900 
shooting with maybe florescent lights it
tells<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.100> color<00:02:57.310> temperature<00:02:57.790> is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
tells it what the color temperature is

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.310 
tells it what the color temperature is
and<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.600> stuff<00:02:58.930> happens

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
and so all of that stuff happens

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.050 
and so all of that stuff happens
automatically<00:02:59.890> effect<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.580> lot<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.850> people

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
automatically effect a lot of people

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.979 
automatically effect a lot of people
don't<00:03:01.150> even<00:03:01.239> know<00:03:01.390> what's<00:03:01.600> happening<00:03:01.930> they

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
don't even know what's happening they

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.050 
don't even know what's happening they
just<00:03:02.140> flip<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.620> their<00:03:02.800> flash<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
just flip this on their flash and the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
just flip this on their flash and the
pictures<00:03:04.450> turn<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:04.810> looking<00:03:05.200> great<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.709> so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
pictures turn out looking great and so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.229 
pictures turn out looking great and so
you<00:03:06.459> don't<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.730> know<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> lot<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.030> stuff

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
you don't have to know a lot of stuff

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.430 
you don't have to know a lot of stuff
you<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.480> sort<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.660> stick<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:08.140> on<00:03:08.260> there

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
you just sort of stick stuff on there

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.750 
you just sort of stick stuff on there
and<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> takes<00:03:09.010> care<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> rest<00:03:09.610> yourself

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and it takes care of the rest yourself

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.310 
and it takes care of the rest yourself
and<00:03:10.090> then<00:03:10.450> you've<00:03:10.600> got<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> normal<00:03:11.080> diffusion

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
and then you've got a normal diffusion

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.140 
and then you've got a normal diffusion
that<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.430> pop<00:03:12.610> on<00:03:12.760> there<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.000> really

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
that you can pop on there to really

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.370 
that you can pop on there to really
soften<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.690> light<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.110> will<00:03:14.230> go<00:03:14.350> over

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
soften the light and that will go over

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.520 
soften the light and that will go over
those<00:03:15.070> gels<00:03:15.489> as<00:03:15.730> well<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.780> all<00:03:16.930> comes<00:03:17.230> as

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
FX or DX format sensor so depending on

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.490 
FX or DX format sensor so depending on
the<00:03:28.329> sensor<00:03:28.630> size<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.049> want<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> different

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
this there's a element in the back of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.250 
this there's a element in the back of
this<00:04:34.120> that's<00:04:34.330> going<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.660> be<00:04:34.780> zooming<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.170> and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
this that's going to be zooming in and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.500 
this that's going to be zooming in and
out<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:36.310> knows<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:37.180> angle<00:04:37.450> of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
out and so it knows that the angle of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.270 
out and so it knows that the angle of
view<00:04:37.750> of<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.140> camera<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.710> getting<00:04:38.890> narrower

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
view of the camera is getting narrower

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.100 
view of the camera is getting narrower
and<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:40.060> your<00:04:40.210> subject<00:04:40.630> is<00:04:40.720> getting<00:04:40.930> farther

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and that your subject is getting farther

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.140 
and that your subject is getting farther
away<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.650> it's<00:04:41.800> narrowing<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.850> angle<00:04:43.060> of

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
away and so it's narrowing the angle of

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.090 
away and so it's narrowing the angle of
view<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.570> flash<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.170> making<00:04:44.740> sure<00:04:44.950> that

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
view of the flash and making sure that

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.830 
view of the flash and making sure that
it<00:04:45.220> can<00:04:45.400> go<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.820> travel<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.540> farther

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
it can go and travel in a farther

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.320 
it can go and travel in a farther
farther<00:04:47.770> distance<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:48.850> that's<00:04:49.090> all

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
farther distance and so that's all

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.650 
farther distance and so that's all
lining<00:04:49.810> up<00:04:50.020> automatically<00:04:50.890> as<00:04:51.190> well<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:52.150> one

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
lining up automatically as well and one

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.790 
lining up automatically as well and one
other<00:04:52.840> thing<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.230> really<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.650> about

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
other thing that I really like about

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.110 
other thing that I really like about
this<00:04:54.040> flash<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.640> can<00:04:54.760> see<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:54.970> there's

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
this flash and you can see that there's

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.520 
this flash and you can see that there's
a<00:04:55.180> long<00:04:55.330> list<00:04:55.570> of<00:04:55.720> things<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.050> like<00:04:56.200> about<00:04:56.350> this

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
a long list of things I like about this

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.900 
a long list of things I like about this
flash<00:04:56.710> but<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.250> one<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.550> they've<00:04:57.880> really

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
flash but this one is they've really

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.180 
flash but this one is they've really
streamlined<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.750> menu<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.320> so<00:04:59.830> what<00:05:00.040> they've

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
streamlined the menu and so what they've

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
streamlined the menu and so what they've
done<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.670> that<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.120> really<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.750> things

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
done and that I really like is things

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.050 
done and that I really like is things
like<00:05:02.140> changing<00:05:02.680> from<00:05:02.830> TTL<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.340> manual<00:05:03.880> or<00:05:04.000> if

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
like changing from TTL to manual or if

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.400 
like changing from TTL to manual or if
you<00:05:04.120> want<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.300> use<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.450> guide<00:05:04.720> number<00:05:05.080> or

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
you want to use a guide number or

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.970 
you want to use a guide number or
control<00:05:05.950> things<00:05:06.850> in<00:05:07.030> zones<00:05:07.620> well<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:08.830> get

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
control things in zones well you can get

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.410 
control things in zones well you can get
to<00:05:09.070> almost<00:05:09.310> all<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:10.000> by<00:05:10.120> flipping

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
to almost all of that just by flipping

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.510 
to almost all of that just by flipping
these<00:05:10.660> switches<00:05:11.110> here<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:12.010> they've<00:05:12.370> done

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
these switches here and so they've done

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.360 
these switches here and so they've done
is<00:05:12.760> Nikon<00:05:13.120> is<00:05:13.210> allowed<00:05:13.510> just<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.620> very<00:05:14.830> bare

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
is Nikon is allowed just the very bare

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.610 
is Nikon is allowed just the very bare
minimum<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:16.140> functionality<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.320> really

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
minimum of functionality that you really

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.710 
minimum of functionality that you really
have<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.950> get<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.220> through<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.940> menus<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.600> so

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
have to get to through the menus and so

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.690 
have to get to through the menus and so
all<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:19.930> major<00:05:20.140> stuff<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:20.890> a<00:05:21.070> click<00:05:21.430> or<00:05:21.610> a

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
all the major stuff is just a click or a

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.270 
all the major stuff is just a click or a
dial<00:05:22.090> away<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.290> it's<00:05:23.680> just<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.950> advanced

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
dial away and so it's just the advanced

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.920 
dial away and so it's just the advanced
stuff<00:05:24.520> for<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:24.760> custom<00:05:25.060> configurations<00:05:25.840> that

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
stuff for the custom configurations that

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.030 
stuff for the custom configurations that
you<00:05:25.990> have<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.170> dive<00:05:26.320> into<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.710> menus<00:05:27.010> to

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
you have to dive into the menus to

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.940 
you have to dive into the menus to
control<00:05:27.640> except<00:05:28.600> for<00:05:28.870> if<00:05:29.110> you're<00:05:29.530> using<00:05:29.740> this

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
control except for if you're using this

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.730 
control except for if you're using this
flash<00:05:30.250> in<00:05:30.520> master<00:05:31.120> mode<00:05:31.300> then<00:05:32.170> you<00:05:32.200> can<00:05:32.440> go<00:05:32.560> and

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
flash in master mode then you can go and

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.620 
flash in master mode then you can go and
use<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:33.100> select<00:05:33.520> button<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.970> choose<00:05:34.240> which

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
use the select button to choose which

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.060 
use the select button to choose which
group<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.260> you're<00:05:35.410> increasing<00:05:35.980> or

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
group that you're increasing or

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.860 
group that you're increasing or
decreasing<00:05:36.190> power<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.120> or<00:05:37.240> turning<00:05:37.540> on<00:05:37.690> or<00:05:37.840> off

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
decreasing power to or turning on or off

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.960 
decreasing power to or turning on or off
or<00:05:38.230> changing<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> way<00:05:38.800> it's<00:05:38.950> behaving<00:05:39.340> but

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
or changing the way it's behaving but

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.510 
or changing the way it's behaving but
it's<00:05:40.090> so<00:05:40.330> intuitive<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.380> again<00:05:42.250> it's<00:05:42.430> not

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
it's so intuitive that again it's not

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.550 
it's so intuitive that again it's not
like<00:05:42.670> setting<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.300> watch<00:05:43.510> from<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.930> 70s<00:05:44.410> where

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
like setting a watch from the 70s where

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.420 
like setting a watch from the 70s where
you<00:05:44.620> had<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.830> know<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.130> different

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
you had to know the different

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.010 
you had to know the different
combinations<00:05:45.970> of<00:05:46.120> button<00:05:46.390> clicks<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:46.870> hold

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
combinations of button clicks and hold

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.390 
combinations of button clicks and hold
this<00:05:47.170> for<00:05:47.230> five<00:05:47.500> seconds<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.040> none<00:05:48.250> of<00:05:48.280> that

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
this for five seconds and none of that

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.130 
this for five seconds and none of that
is<00:05:48.670> in<00:05:48.700> this<00:05:49.000> flash<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.420> just<00:05:49.600> push<00:05:50.020> the

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
is in this flash you just push the

select button roll the style hit OK for
almost<00:05:52.720> all<00:05:52.930> of<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.230> features<00:05:53.560> it's<00:05:53.740> really

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
almost all of the features it's really

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.440 
almost all of the features it's really
intuitive

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
intuitive

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.420 
intuitive
now<00:05:56.050> this<00:05:56.230> flash<00:05:56.440> also<00:05:56.800> has<00:05:56.920> something<00:05:57.400> that

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
now this flash also has something that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.850 
now this flash also has something that
is<00:05:58.000> found<00:05:58.360> on<00:05:58.540> higher<00:05:58.840> price<00:05:59.140> flash<00:05:59.500> it's

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
is found on higher price flash it's
