00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.380
 things about mortal kombat simple to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.529
 Who does not know the deadly kombat 10 was 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 announced and we already know a lot 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 His thing already has a game play trailer. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.390
 tv day is from fatalities new character to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.140
 People already know it's going to have the daughter of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.030
 johnny cage with sÃ´nia so this is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 very cool because the story of mk 10 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.460
 In this new mkx he will be 25 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.649
 years after this story mk 9 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 and did you know that mortal kombat has a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.000
 simple story for those who do not know 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.410
 mortal kombat he has a history that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.409
 has a really cool story 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.770
 Actually this 1.9 engine is kind of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.390
 rebellion of the history of mortal kombat 1 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 2 and 3 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 and it's not just the rebound without the team's 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.299
 from here start again they no longer have a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 link between the end of the story 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.360
 say original and the beginning of this new 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.970
 story 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.290
 I thought I found it very cool to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.000
 balcony of them and I wanted to not only bring 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.159
 this mp to you talk a little bit 6 to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 10 but also ask you guys 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.130
 know the history of the new music you 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.590
 they knew that a mortal kombat has a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 story many of you knew but I 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 I may have some who did not know and I 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 Back I want to know if you want 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:49.680
 see you want to see the story of 69 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 here is a story mode of ethanol is 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.570
 various ethnic groups and in the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.799
 time to face the other roll the fight 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.880
 It 's really cool, I really liked that. 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 I like fashion history very nice 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.729
 shape but you know it but if you do not 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.229
 knows 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.270
 it would be good for you to know 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.560
 history and how are you watching the game? 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.379
 all in Portuguese 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.660
 so of course the caption is not the dubbing 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.600
 but I'm not mistaken in dubbing the world 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.320
 fittings or mk 10 is also come in 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.270
 Portuguese because there are injustices enjoy 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.400
 that is the fight game of adc da 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.160
 warner and the spill that also made a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.260
 mortal kombat it's all translated is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.700
 both the legend dubbing account in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.690
 Portuguese and I think this is cool 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.010
 A nice thing to score and score x in 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.950
 Portuguese 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.360
 So I wanted to hear from you guys. 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.400
 want to see a story that if people 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:52.820
 make a story mode of the mortal 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:03:01.620
 kombat here together the story is a bit 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:03.720
 complicated playing but then it was going to be 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.360
 Nice I think many of you already 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 know the story and is a story that 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 deserves to be seen 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
 even for those who do not like the game of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.140
 The fight itself only learns a little about 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.850
 story that has a really cool story 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.720
 behind this bloody game that the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.570
 own speaking game developers 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.060
 here is a type of art i agree this 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.290
 violence is not a violence she 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.360
 There is a pure violence that only has 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.120
 most blood in the area has a 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.510
 creativity in the middle so I think it's cool and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.890
 taking the violence aside throws in the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.739
 Side violence has a very 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.650
 nice to be told 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.140
 If you want to see it, let's 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.570

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.840

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.060

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.020

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.690
 even the most famous mode of mortal kombat 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.220
 under the exchange of an idea with you and 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.600
 also put the character that you 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.790
 play right 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.390
 he is very good the character is very 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.130
 cool and his story in the midst of mortal 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.670
 kombat he appears dead as of 3 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.820
 huh 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.830
 It's really cool how he turns this 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.579
 animal with this mask is actually a 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.939
 human galera but there is the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.699
 I'll ask you guys though a 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.439
 Deadly kombat story for us to stay 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.990
 knowing what this story was like 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:35.379
 Let's end this fight here and we'll 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.659
 This video ends three fights okay 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.280
 the drug even more with jack appealing 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.430
 Holy crap on the machine to play. 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.900
 is not there these things but it is very worth it 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.479
 let's start one of the skills of the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.430
 than ozone. 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.159
 For those who do not know their father, damn it. 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.870
 who does not know the fighting games they have 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.919
 various styling nomenclatures 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.770
 games right 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.960
 and this style of appeal to the people 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.849
 Speak that you stand your image in the corner 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.400
 in fact it is a very play style 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.219
 used in championships and everything else 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.590
 zone style that is the one you keep 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:18.400
 your comfort zone as well as the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.849
 own name of this is r attack zone 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.419
 you attack from afar and you have the 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:29.229
 your attack guaranteeing your defense 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.610
 also , too , and the full 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.259
 despite being a recital that is 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.599
 precisely the opposite is actually a 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.669
 dream but the elements of his management 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.259
 are very powerful that is the face of the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.900
 hearing the opposite of the men you 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:45.819
 Up and hit everything. 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.089
 his zone is very efficient so it gives 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.639
 It's so much for you to stay in June while 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:06:02.500
 in removing his original almost this 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:06:05.400
 here is very potent drug shot takes 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400

 fatality to end it already was then it is 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.880
