00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
got diseased was all dead so that when I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
got diseased was all dead so that when I
had<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> cut<00:00:14.849> down<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.690> other<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.020> here

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
had to cut down and this other one here

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980 
had to cut down and this other one here
the<00:00:16.890> top<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.460> broke<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:18.029> from<00:00:18.060> previous

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
the top was broke off from previous
storms<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.460> all<00:00:20.699> bent<00:00:21.029> over<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.970> now<00:00:23.970> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
storms and it was all bent over so now I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.189 
storms and it was all bent over so now I
put<00:00:24.330> down<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.779> grass<00:00:25.050> seed<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.490> lets

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
put down some grass seed here so lets

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:38.950 
put down some grass seed here so lets
water<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> hopefully

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.680 

hopefully<00:00:39.950> we'll<00:00:40.160> get<00:00:40.370> lucky

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:01:07.470 

that's<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.199> property<00:00:48.359> boundary<00:00:49.359> there

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:17.370 

keep<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.560> moist<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.570> key<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:17.290> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
keep it moist that's the key I want to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.020 
keep it moist that's the key I want to
soak<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.860> too<00:01:18.040> much<00:01:18.280> because<00:01:18.460> then<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.850> make

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
soak it too much because then you make

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.890 
soak it too much because then you make
the<00:01:19.060> grassy<00:01:20.160> run<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.780> just<00:01:22.810> soak<00:01:23.290> up<00:01:24.900> nice

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
the grassy run but just soak up nice

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.400 
the grassy run but just soak up nice
warm<00:01:26.200> weather<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:28.540> schooler<00:01:29.170> though

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
warm weather so they schooler though

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.570 
warm weather so they schooler though

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
it's in the probably high 60s but it's
