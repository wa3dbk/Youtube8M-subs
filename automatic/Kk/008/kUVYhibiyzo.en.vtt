00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.080
 very important question for motorists 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.059
 gas impact on the engine in this respect 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.039
 There are several stereotypes for example 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.019
 there is an opinion that when driving on gas can 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.369
 burn out the valves we asked for 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.929
 clarification in beauty 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.560
 it all depends on correctness 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.829
 settings from the correct settings here 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.109
 this system is powered 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:34.250
 liquefied gas particular i think that 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.699
 if well we have a terminal oil and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.039
 gas 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.530
 they set up this system father back 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.609
 or foreign, on occasion not 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.829
 interference with this system in principle 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.839
 That this should not be observed that is 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.210
 no need to interfere in 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.839
 Adjusted second system 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.850
 stereotype 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.030
 reduced engine life 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.699
 working on gas they say it dries in 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.940
 engine rings wear everything else 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.340
 but judging by the oil consumption rings 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 here I do not see this all the oil is not 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.080
 topped up and how was it on my probe such 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.580
 during normal engine operation on gas 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.340
 you can even increase the service life 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.040
 engine oil and the engine itself but for 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.920
 due to which liquefied gas evaporates better 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 gasoline therefore does not thin the oil easily 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.990
 mixed with air and burned 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.580
 evenly and completely the combustion process 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.120
 proceeds less intensity 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.710
 build up pressure so the load on 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.860
 cranksetting parts 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.660
 there will be less engine oil pollution 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.550
 and liquefy the engine oil which is very 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.500
 essential for gasoline engine 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.730
 there will be less therefore a work resource 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.250
 engine oil 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.110
 a half to two times you can raise the most 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 engine 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 there is a need to watch but if you comply with all 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.130
 conditions 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.220
 under our some data to z resource 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.710
 can also be upgraded up to 1.5 times 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.540
 gas does not contain a series of lead which 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.300
 chemical level destroy parts 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.060
 combustion chamber and catalyst ignition 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.340
 gas does not form carbon deposits on the pistons 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.200
 spark plugs and so that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 understand enough imagine household 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.280
 gas stove clean burning without smoke and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.290
 soot 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.600
 even if you stand in the box ready car 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.790
 can not suppress something that acrid smell 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.010
 oral non-toxic with gasoline i.e. 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.859
 Well, roughly addicts bond pipe 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.049
 do nothing besides, octane gas 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.730
 the number is higher than gasoline 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.950
 octane number determines how much 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.689
 you can compress the fuel in the cylinder to not 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.590
 there was a knock that can 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.049
 damage the engine 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.819
 usually with such a thing say fingers 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.590
 bang for example this can happen 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.329
 if the car is designed to work 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.750
 on 92 petrol 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.389
 pour 80, but if you pour 95 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.549
 phenomena will not happen octane gas 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.530
 ranges from 100 to 105 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.900
 That is why the car is calculated 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.959
 Ride only on gasoline may be 98 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.180
 Detonation fill gas at 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.980
 using gas fuel but 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.359
 never observed in modern 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.239
 engines because the engines for their 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.000
 designs are designed to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.409
 gasoline coarse liquid fuel 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.989
 octane number which is natural on 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.049
 order but by 10 20 units 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.419
 here is an investigator su method below therefore 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.340
 no detonation unnecessarily observed 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.319
 by the way engines specifically 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.840
 designed to work on gas have 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.849
 increased compression ratio 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.510
 hence the gas engine efficiency is higher 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.510
 gasoline
