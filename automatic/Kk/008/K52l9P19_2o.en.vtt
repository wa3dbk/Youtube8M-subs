00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
guy that now lets embed the code okay so

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.890 
guy that now lets embed the code okay so
now<00:02:40.650> let's<00:02:41.099> grab<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.459> code<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.510> embed

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
now let's grab the code that will embed

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.740 
now let's grab the code that will embed
our<00:02:43.049> game<00:02:43.290> into<00:02:43.739> our<00:02:43.940> into<00:02:44.940> our<00:02:45.030> web<00:02:45.209> page<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
our game into our into our web page I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.470 
our game into our into our web page I
have<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.830> code<00:02:47.099> right<00:02:47.819> here<00:02:47.849> I'm<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.390> gonna

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
have the code right here I'm just gonna

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.750 
have the code right here I'm just gonna
copy<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.019> paste<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.620> I'm<00:02:50.069> gonna<00:02:50.220> put<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.459> link

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
copy and paste it I'm gonna put a link

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400 
copy and paste it I'm gonna put a link
to<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.120> github<00:02:51.450> account<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> description

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
to my github account in the description

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.880 
to my github account in the description
and<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.370> where<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.610> code<00:02:53.910> will<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.769> it's<00:02:55.769> a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and that's where the code will be it's a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.009 
and that's where the code will be it's a
simple<00:02:56.280> object<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.480> code<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.870> really

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
simple object all this code is really

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.270 
simple object all this code is really
standard<00:02:58.530> that's<00:02:58.680> why<00:02:58.769> I'm<00:02:58.829> not<00:02:58.950> really<00:02:59.010> gonna

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
standard that's why I'm not really gonna

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.300 
standard that's why I'm not really gonna
go<00:02:59.459> over<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.030> um<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.260> code<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.590> provided<00:03:01.769> by

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
go over it um the code is provided by

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.880 
go over it um the code is provided by
unity<00:03:02.910> I'm<00:03:03.299> not<00:03:03.480> sure<00:03:03.660> where<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.019> found<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.799> but

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
unity I'm not sure where I found it but

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.559 
unity I'm not sure where I found it but
that's<00:03:05.010> kind<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.459> why<00:03:05.819> I'm<00:03:06.060> doing<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
that's kind of like why I'm doing this

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.330 
that's kind of like why I'm doing this
video<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:07.410> because<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.829> was<00:03:07.950> having<00:03:08.220> trouble

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
video is because I was having trouble

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.150 
video is because I was having trouble
embed<00:03:08.819> in<00:03:08.940> my<00:03:09.030> video<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:10.380> embedding<00:03:10.680> my<00:03:10.799> game

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
embed in my video or embedding my game

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.850 
embed in my video or embedding my game
into<00:03:11.880> my<00:03:12.060> web<00:03:12.269> page<00:03:12.569> but<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.110> found<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.590> code

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
into my web page but I found this code

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.270 
into my web page but I found this code
it<00:03:14.250> works<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.900> standard<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.799> there's<00:03:17.190> gonna

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it works it's standard and there's gonna

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.170 
it works it's standard and there's gonna
be<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.670> link<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.690> link<00:03:19.670> directly<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
be a link to it a link directly to the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.140 
be a link to it a link directly to the
github<00:03:21.450> page<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.170> has<00:03:22.350> it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
github page that has it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.840 
github page that has it
so<00:03:24.150> anyways<00:03:24.630> all<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.920> worry<00:03:26.160> about<00:03:26.310> is

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
so anyways all we have to worry about is

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.559 
so anyways all we have to worry about is
this<00:03:27.329> source<00:03:27.690> file<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.980> take<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.730> now<00:03:30.120> we

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
this source file we take it and now we

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.720 
this source file we take it and now we
basically<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.109> input<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.650> path<00:03:32.069> on<00:03:32.400> where

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
basically just input the path on where

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.809 
basically just input the path on where
our<00:03:32.850> unity<00:03:33.269> 3d<00:03:33.510> file<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.230> where<00:03:35.069> is<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.459> let's

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
our unity 3d file is where is that let's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.379 
our unity 3d file is where is that let's
find<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.640 

let<00:03:39.389> me<00:03:39.510> close<00:03:39.900> out<00:03:40.170> some<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:42.560> let's<00:03:43.560> go

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
let me close out some of this let's go

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.479 
let me close out some of this let's go
back<00:03:43.680> into<00:03:44.040> our<00:03:44.220> web<00:03:44.400> folder<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.780> unity3d

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
back into our web folder the unity3d

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.590 
back into our web folder the unity3d
file<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.819> found<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.810> MLP<00:03:49.170> beta<00:03:49.799> folder<00:03:50.310> and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
file is found in the MLP beta folder and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.680 
file is found in the MLP beta folder and
then<00:03:51.600> it's<00:03:51.870> MLP<00:03:52.440> beta<00:03:52.709> dot<00:03:53.280> unity3d<00:03:53.760> let's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
then it's MLP beta dot unity3d let's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:03.699 
then it's MLP beta dot unity3d let's
input<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:58.670> MLP<00:03:59.670> beta<00:03:59.940> folder<00:04:01.790> MLP<00:04:02.790> beta

unity3d that's the path now let's launch

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.759 
unity3d that's the path now let's launch
it<00:04:08.630> okay<00:04:09.630> let's<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.930> ahead<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.200> open<00:04:10.290> our<00:04:10.560> file

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
it okay let's go ahead and open our file

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.069 
it okay let's go ahead and open our file
and<00:04:11.639> open<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.030> chrome<00:04:12.510> let's<00:04:12.810> have<00:04:12.900> some

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
and open it with chrome let's have some

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.589 
and open it with chrome let's have some
problems<00:04:13.440> with<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.709> safari<00:04:14.669> earlier<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.180> it's

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
problems with a safari earlier but it's

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.759 
problems with a safari earlier but it's
