00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 it leads so far 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 for the program yes know that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 but I had his signs 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.650
 some markets dim 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.660
 all the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
 especially growth 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.850
 in total there are not 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.210
 apple does not dictate 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.240
 green 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 but we have to go for that anyway 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.210
 there will of course 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 in the quarterfinals where then equals 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 however, carpenter 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.070
 determined last week 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 just 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.180
 as long as a role 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 you notice immediately in action 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 we went to type them 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.439
 just like on a contract 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
 it made me less 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.579
 masters are 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 getting exciting 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.369
 the position at 2 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 the starting line 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.659
 I long for the south 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.989
 I've been a few times 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.679
 for the timing 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.129
 of course see in shorts 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.129
 we are not complaining 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:44.219
 afterwards but you have
