00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
saw in the first pump she wasn't just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.539 
saw in the first pump she wasn't just
comic<00:01:39.299> relief<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.750> mater<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.470> cars<00:01:40.710> it

comic relief like mater was in cars it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.710 
comic relief like mater was in cars it
depends<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.180> direction<00:01:42.450> they're<00:01:42.659> going

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
depends on what direction they're going

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
depends on what direction they're going
to<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> take

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to take this in if they're going to take

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
to take this in if they're going to take
it<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> similar<00:01:44.909> country<00:01:45.210> direction<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it in a similar country direction to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
it in a similar country direction to
cars<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:45.990> yeah<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> suck<00:01:47.250> but

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
cars too yeah it's going to suck but

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
cars too yeah it's going to suck but
they<00:01:47.640> could<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.299> another<00:01:48.540> direction

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
they could take it in another direction

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
they could take it in another direction
and<00:01:49.110> sort<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> better<00:01:49.740> explore<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.490> character

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and sort of better explore the character

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
and sort of better explore the character
and<00:01:51.090> her<00:01:51.869> background<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.890> logical

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and her background the logical

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
and her background the logical
conclusion<00:01:53.369> obviously<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> she's<00:01:54.810> going

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
conclusion obviously is that she's going

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
conclusion obviously is that she's going
to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> main<00:01:55.350> character<00:01:55.829> given<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> her

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to be the main character given that her

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.959 
to be the main character given that her
name<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> title<00:01:57.560> however<00:01:58.560> nima<00:01:59.520> wasn't

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
name is in the title however nima wasn't

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
name is in the title however nima wasn't
exactly<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.570> main<00:02:00.840> character<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> finding

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
exactly the main character to finding

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.300 
exactly the main character to finding
nemo's<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.570> who<00:02:03.570> knows<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.710> bigger<00:02:05.130> thing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
nemo's so who knows the bigger thing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.380 
nemo's so who knows the bigger thing
actually<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> bugs<00:02:06.090> me<00:02:06.210> actually

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
actually that kind of bugs me actually

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.919 
actually that kind of bugs me actually
about<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.380> title<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.670> finding<00:02:09.239> part<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
about this title is the finding part of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.029 
about this title is the finding part of
it<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> suggests<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> me<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it that kind of suggests to me that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400 
it that kind of suggests to me that
maybe<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.610> maybe<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> basic<00:02:12.870> plot<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
maybe this is maybe the basic plot is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.920 
maybe this is maybe the basic plot is
just<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
just going to be

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.530 
just going to be
rehash<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.069> first<00:02:15.640> film<00:02:15.909> but<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.150> just

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
rehash of the first film but it's just

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
rehash of the first film but it's just
during<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.439> has<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.739> rescued<00:02:18.099> rather

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
during that has to be rescued rather

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
during that has to be rescued rather
than<00:02:18.609> Nemo<00:02:18.939> to<00:02:19.299> get<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.689> the<00:02:20.019> actual<00:02:20.140> reason<00:02:20.439> I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
than Nemo to get to the actual reason I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.030 
than Nemo to get to the actual reason I
wanted<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> make<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.980> video<00:02:21.189> today<00:02:21.540> um<00:02:22.540> I

wanted to make the video today um I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.140 
wanted to make the video today um I
recently<00:02:24.040> found<00:02:24.310> out<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.969> they're

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
recently found out so that they're

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.209 
recently found out so that they're
actually<00:02:25.480> going<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.689> set<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.109> in<00:02:26.349> California

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
actually going to set this in California

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.580 
actually going to set this in California
which<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.239> interesting<00:02:28.959> seeing<00:02:29.260> as<00:02:29.379> how<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
which is interesting seeing as how the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.459 
which is interesting seeing as how the
original<00:02:30.400> film<00:02:30.670> takes<00:02:31.540> place<00:02:31.629> on<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.290> Great

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
Barrier Reef and Sydney Harbour so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.860 
Barrier Reef and Sydney Harbour so
assuming<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:37.150> film<00:02:37.389> is<00:02:37.480> going<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.719> feature

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
assuming this film is going to feature

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.479 
assuming this film is going to feature
the<00:02:38.109> same<00:02:38.290> characters<00:02:38.859> you<00:02:39.099> know<00:02:39.159> and<00:02:39.400> not

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
the same characters you know and not

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.179 
the same characters you know and not
just<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.969> no<00:02:40.150> alternate<00:02:41.079> universe<00:02:41.469> versions

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
just and no alternate universe versions

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.309 
just and no alternate universe versions
of<00:02:42.280> them<00:02:42.459> or<00:02:42.549> something<00:02:42.670> they<00:02:43.180> will<00:02:43.420> either<00:02:44.019> at

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
of them or something they will either at

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.319 
of them or something they will either at
some<00:02:44.500> point<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:44.889> film<00:02:45.010> or<00:02:45.370> perhaps<00:02:45.909> have

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
some point in the film or perhaps have

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.839 
some point in the film or perhaps have
in<00:02:46.659> between<00:02:46.989> films<00:02:47.349> traveled<00:02:48.129> seven<00:02:48.669> and<00:02:48.819> a

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
in between films traveled seven and a

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.879 
in between films traveled seven and a
half<00:02:48.879> thousand<00:02:49.569> miles<00:02:49.900> across<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> Pacific

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
half thousand miles across the Pacific

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.490 
half thousand miles across the Pacific
Ocean<00:02:51.400> basically<00:02:52.389> so<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> don't<00:02:53.079> really<00:02:53.260> know

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
Ocean basically so I don't really know

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190 
Ocean basically so I don't really know
her<00:02:53.889> how<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:54.519> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.760> happen<00:02:54.909> or<00:02:55.720> why

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
her how that's going to happen or why

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440 
her how that's going to happen or why
they<00:02:56.379> would<00:02:56.530> choose<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.889> do<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.220> or<00:02:57.489> even<00:02:58.299> how

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
they would choose to do that or even how

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.629 
they would choose to do that or even how
they<00:02:58.480> would<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:59.049> capable<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.680> doing<00:02:59.919> that<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
they would be capable of doing that the

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.979 
they would be capable of doing that the
idea<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:00.909> it's<00:03:01.180> taking<00:03:01.750> place<00:03:01.780> in

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
idea that it's taking place in

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.720 
idea that it's taking place in
California<00:03:02.439> that<00:03:02.500> has<00:03:02.889> me<00:03:03.069> more<00:03:03.310> concerned

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
California that has me more concerned

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.520 
California that has me more concerned
really<00:03:04.060> later<00:03:04.389> then<00:03:05.049> maybe<00:03:05.230> don't<00:03:05.469> know

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
really later then maybe don't know

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.770 
really later then maybe don't know
really<00:03:06.280> where<00:03:06.459> they're<00:03:06.639> going<00:03:06.849> with<00:03:06.879> this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
really where they're going with this

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.530 
really where they're going with this
film<00:03:08.439> but<00:03:08.950> sir<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.579> am<00:03:10.000> interested<00:03:10.209> in

film but sir I am interested in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.539 
film but sir I am interested in
