00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello everyone here I left 88 and it's good 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.869
 I come to talk a little about the keyboards 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.340
 mechanical and membrane keyboards 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.200
 the differences are the pros and the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.420
 cons of each one let's start with 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.890
 the mechanical keyboards compared to 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.010
 the membrane keyboards are much more 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.320
 expensive make more noise last longer and weigh 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.210
 more but that's not the main 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.949
 difference the main difference between 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.470
 a membrane keyboard and keyboard 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.280
 mechanical is that a mechanical keyboard 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.710
 has a switch is worth a mechanism in 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 each key instead the keyboard of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.550
 membrane has a membrane throughout 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.830
 of the entire surface of the keyboard that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.890
 connect all the keys and all the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 keys are connected to that membrane 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.220
 this makes generally the keyboards 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.530
 mechanics are more robust because 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.049
 each key goes separately and have 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.850
 much better touch the mechanical keyboards 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.680
 they also tend to be much more precise 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.260
 that the membrane keyboards because of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.790
 that mechanical keyboards sound before 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.110
 that the membrane keyboards that I want 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.479
 say with this then that when you like 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 a key on a mechanical keyboard sounds 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.670
 more or less half of the pulsation 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.150
 maximum you can do on this key in 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.790
 change on a keyboard 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.950
 you have to press until the bottom is worth 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.930
 to sound the key this basically 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.550
 that you can write much faster 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.380
 mechanical keyboard compared to a 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.880
 membrane keyboard all this are the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.710
 advantages of a mechanical keyboard but 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.360
 Of course the disadvantages are several 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 first is that it weighs a lot for example I 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 the one that I have here the rapper black widow 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.620
 of 2013 edition I think it's pretty much 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.390
 weighs around two or three kilos worth 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.220
 it's quite on the keyboard instead of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.720
 membrane weighs almost nothing weighs neither 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.830
 half a kilo then also worth as it has already 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.930
 said at the beginning of the video the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.030
 mechanical keyboards cost a lot more 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.850
 they are much more expensive, a keyboard is worth 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.800
 Mechanical can cost you much more than 100 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.700
 euros worth usually cost you more 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.290
 of 100 euros 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.510
 On the other hand , the membrane keyboard is normal 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.520
 it can cost you 15 or 20 euros worth that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.990
 it's a brutal difference and it's the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.280
 main reason why the greatest 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 part of front has keyboards of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 membrane instead of mechanical keyboards 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.950
 I recommend a mechanical keyboard the truth 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.540
 is that yes I recommend it because of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.070
 that I carry with one for more than six 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.020
 months and I do not regret at all the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.640
 buy to write faster and it's 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.530
 much more comfortable than a keyboard 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.580
 window and nothing up there the first 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.650
 differences inside the keyboards 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.930
 mechanical and membrane keyboards 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.390
 I leave you with a small timelapse of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 when you remove the keypad keys 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 mechanics to clean it and nothing we 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 let's go to the next video so far 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.400
 how
