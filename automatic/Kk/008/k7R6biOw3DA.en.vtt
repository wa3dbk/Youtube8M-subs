00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello welcome on how do we do 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 today I will show you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.750
 how to carve a pear tree 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.160
 so to start we will cut all 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.529
 the little tips the ends where there are 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 buds here we cut 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 here we see that it's a bit dry in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 cutting by then we see that c 'is that it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 cut every time we cut by 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 after that it will be a little bit 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 bud that will grow back and you will see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 there will be new buds and so 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.809
 new fruits then all these 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 little balls to these little ones 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.940
 excrescences that we do not touch 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 because next year it will be two 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.239
 pretty fruits 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.539
 so if you want your art 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.670
 grow up and just cut you off 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 the trinities if you want history to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.199
 your height obviously cut you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 lower then me there I just want one 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 branch so I cut this one his 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 hike only one and you do 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.930
 this until the end so here we see I 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.119
 you do have a few branches there 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 goes directly into the tree the one 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.470
 I do not like it so I find it at 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 its end here the same we see that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.439
 a branch that goes directly into 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.450
 the tree also end the day 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 one that I let grow and that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 I will attach after which the barbed wire 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.759
 this one I do not touch here we see that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.259
 it's anarchy 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:48.229
 so here we will do a little bit of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 household we will cut the one we go 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.140
 cut this one there are two there we see 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.829
 you had one coming here is a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 who just next door so both of 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.990
 one next to the other tÃ©treault so 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.750
 we will remove those we keep 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160
 obviously the little bits like that and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.370
 here 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.980
 here we realize that she is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.150
 maybe a little too much 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.280
 we go the cut is also here we are 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.690
 do the same for the rest and the other 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 side and your focus is cut out see 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.519
 it's really very simple and we have a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.430
 weight was cut ten times pretty 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.260
 fruit next year see you soon 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.560
 for new videos on how 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.560
 does one
