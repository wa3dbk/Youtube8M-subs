00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.130
 so now he comes again the time of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.519
 warm jackets and I am by accident 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 come in two patterns on it 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.410
 probably they exist 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 probably they have some 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.690
 names 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 I really wanted something different 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.999
 knit out there are two very 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.279
 I did not have to interesting you 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.819
 I want to withhold knit 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 namely a very thick jacket and 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:32.250
 the first pattern that I show you where 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.000
 she has to be there, of course 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 she is terribly annoying at the moment 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 first pattern reminds me of one 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 quilted down jacket 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 that is extremely tick it almost makes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 the first look is spectacular 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.980
 but extremely thick and is actually a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.720
 double knitted but no smooth 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 patient and no hose that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.780
 just had to try himself strictly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 Simply a piece of music 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 right and then a bit of this 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.609
 pattern then you see clearly that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 difference 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:17.310
 I use the miele kolarik here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.429
 has great colors with one 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 Knitting needle number 8 so take pretty much 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.759
 the stretched uneasy ticker as 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 specified otherwise it is in fact such a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.579
 Bisserl during brad and nice fluffy 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.899
 but still it gets along with body 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.899
 relatively thick needles 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.410
 you need an odd number mesh 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.320
 and I'll show you the return or first 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 the second had to be in line that we too 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.890
 the return journey after a stop is 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.740
 the edge mesh I stretch right and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 then alternately a stitch 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:13.800
 on the right a stitch on the left a stitch 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:17.010
 on the right a stitch on the left a stitch 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.320
 turn right at the left and so on 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.350
 until the end of the row there such a 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.560
 odd mesh number have you die 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.660
 then there is a mesh right on 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.550
 end that was the second had to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.520
 or the return journey to 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.110
 a stitch stop the first pattern 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.530
 line 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:45.690
 the front edge stitch stretch me 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.940
 right and now a mesh right me 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 Wrongly put a stitch right 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.040
 and a stitch lift a stitch right 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.030
 a hoist always lift the lift 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.269
 right a sting thread remains behind 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.670
 a stitch on the right lift a stitch 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.680
 So knit the left machine on the right 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.260
 because that's a horrible thing to the right 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.830
 arises and lift off the right ground 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 the left stitch on the right stretch the 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.510
 lift off the right ground 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.140
 that's the front page, respectively 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.570
 the first one had to be rey and those two 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.280
 Reinsch you always trick in turns 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.650
 So really quite simple is kind of 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.110
 big difference to a smooth one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.750
 right or to a rip pattern it 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.420
 will be at least twice as thick all over 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.810
 meaty and as if it were one 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.050
 a bit padded or as if it were his 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.329
 style hose strictly so if anyone 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.650
 you know how this pattern is called 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.870
 if I'm grateful for that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.569
 I have called it plummer plummer 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.709
 means take 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.739
 is Latin for the mood and 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.620
 It 's as soft as a down jacket 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.749
 is very very nice elastic rolls 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.980
 but not so it does not pull it 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:10.750
 it does not stay that way either 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.010
 and most beautiful you see the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.139
 difference if you are a bit smooth 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.930
 strictly right and then a bit in 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.199
 this pattern then you know how 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.690
 Much thicker this material is 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.410
 really great for winter hunting not strictly 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.599
 me just one and of course for caps 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.229
 or other things that are compliant 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.930
 have to 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.900
 I have another whole thing with me 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.150
 Knitted you see, there I have 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.889
 a piece just smooth right penetrated 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.229
 Knitted and you can see that completely 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.229
 clearly the difference to a smooth 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.449
 on the right this is very thin and very thin 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.970
 rolls in 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.180
 this pattern is at least twice as 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.300
 thick very soft and rolls naturally 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.919
 not a 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.940
 So that means you can do it of course 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.940
 also work with thinner yarns and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.770
 for a thick pullover or for 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.099
 Children's jackets is also right 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.199
 good thing and in a second video show 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.159
 I'll give you a minuteness 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.159
 changed 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.289
 comes out a completely different pattern and 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.860
 that would be very nice to find loop a lot 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.860
 enjoy it
