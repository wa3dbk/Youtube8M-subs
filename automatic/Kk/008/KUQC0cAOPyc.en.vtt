00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the charger and then the system itself

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.630 
the charger and then the system itself
it's<00:03:18.810> right<00:03:18.960> here<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.560> put<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.830> charger

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.960 
on the inside like like other system
like<00:04:21.660> no<00:04:22.109> other<00:04:22.290> system<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.340> you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
like no other system is but that you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.540 
like no other system is but that you
might<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.240> helped<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.630> less<00:04:24.800> but<00:04:25.800> this

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
might have helped it's one less but this

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.020 
might have helped it's one less but this
is<00:04:26.669> probably<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.240> simplest<00:04:28.340> design<00:04:29.340> for<00:04:30.000> a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
is probably the simplest design for a

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.529 
is probably the simplest design for a
limited<00:04:30.569> edition<00:04:30.780> model<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:32.120> let<00:04:33.120> me<00:04:33.210> do<00:04:33.389> some

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
limited edition model and let me do some

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.869 
limited edition model and let me do some
up<00:04:33.659> close<00:04:33.690> shots<00:04:34.139> here<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.800> see<00:04:34.879> see

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
up close shots here so you can see see

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.309 
up close shots here so you can see see
it<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.090> person<00:04:36.300> or<00:04:36.690> see<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.990> through<00:04:37.199> this

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
it in person or see it through this

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.159 
it in person or see it through this
video<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:39.210> silver<00:04:39.629> is<00:04:39.810> really<00:04:39.840> nice<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
video the silver is really nice the the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.300 
video the silver is really nice the the
Mario<00:04:43.470> Luigi<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:44.840> there<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:46.080> kind<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.560> cool<00:04:46.740> but

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
Mario Luigi on there is kind of cool but

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.950 
Mario Luigi on there is kind of cool but
yeah<00:04:47.490> very<00:04:47.699> simple<00:04:48.180> they<00:04:48.330> didn't<00:04:48.599> really<00:04:48.750> go

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
yeah very simple they didn't really go

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.540 
yeah very simple they didn't really go

comparison's<00:05:07.560> sake<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:07.949> is<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.400> japan<00:05:08.759> won

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
comparison's sake this is the japan won

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.899 
comparison's sake this is the japan won
a<00:05:09.719> lot<00:05:10.259> of<00:05:10.440> lot<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.889> weegee's<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:11.400> that<00:05:11.550> one<00:05:11.729> a

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
a lot of lot of weegee's on that one a

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
XL will be a I don't think a very

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.010 
XL will be a I don't think a very
popular<00:05:31.169> system<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.659> might<00:05:33.659> be<00:05:33.810> work

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
popular system so might be work

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.040 
popular system so might be work
something<00:05:34.529> probably<00:05:35.279> not<00:05:35.460> though<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:35.969> a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
something probably not though this is a

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.779 
something probably not though this is a
just<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.169> very<00:05:37.440> simple<00:05:37.620> last<00:05:38.069> of<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.370> year<00:05:38.580> kind

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
just a very simple last of the year kind

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.089 
just a very simple last of the year kind
