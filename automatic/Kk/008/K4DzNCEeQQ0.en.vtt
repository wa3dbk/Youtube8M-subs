00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and it's pretty simple it just once you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.229 
and it's pretty simple it just once you
like<00:02:50.660> at<00:02:50.810> first<00:02:51.019> if<00:02:51.320> like<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:53.030> learn

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
like at first if like you learn

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.910 
like at first if like you learn
something<00:02:53.540> brand-new<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.350> hard<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:54.769> once

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
something brand-new it's hard but once

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.410 
something brand-new it's hard but once
you<00:02:55.070> get<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> know<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:55.820> really<00:02:56.120> it's

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420
