00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
together a little longer and then a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.569 
together a little longer and then a
little<00:00:36.200> more<00:00:37.200> movement<00:00:37.680> i<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.920> say<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:38.129> can't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
little more movement i would say i can't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.720 
little more movement i would say i can't
i<00:00:38.940> haven't<00:00:39.210> wrapped<00:00:39.329> my<00:00:39.450> head<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
i haven't wrapped my head around it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.850 
i haven't wrapped my head around it
and<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.149> lot<00:00:41.329> of<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.540> burden<00:00:41.899> goes<00:00:42.530> on<00:00:42.680> me

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
and a lot of the burden goes on me

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.850 
and a lot of the burden goes on me
obviously<00:00:43.040> being<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.640> point<00:00:43.910> cars<00:00:44.120> so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
obviously being the point cars so

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.290 
obviously being the point cars so
somewhere<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:46.309> gotta<00:00:46.430> go<00:00:46.610> back<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.030> film

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
somewhere you gotta go back to the film

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.650 
somewhere you gotta go back to the film
and<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:47.989> see<00:00:48.579> see<00:00:49.579> when<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:49.850> did<00:00:50.059> sport<00:00:50.420> you

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
and just see see when we did sport you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.210 
and just see see when we did sport you
know<00:00:50.720> what<00:00:50.989> those<00:00:51.140> musicians<00:00:51.440> look<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.010> and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
know what those musicians look like and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.450 
know what those musicians look like and
I<00:00:52.250> think<00:00:53.500> passing<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.860> cutting<00:00:55.160> through

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
I think passing and cutting through

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.030 
I think passing and cutting through
playing<00:00:56.030> off<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.270> big<00:00:56.600> men<00:00:56.809> getting<00:00:57.559> pick<00:00:58.010> a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
playing off the big men getting pick a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.660 
playing off the big men getting pick a
roles<00:00:58.339> in<00:00:58.610> two<00:00:58.790> weeks<00:00:59.239> I've<00:00:59.449> swings<00:01:00.670> hitting

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
roles in two weeks I've swings hitting

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.579 
roles in two weeks I've swings hitting
the<00:01:01.699> open<00:01:01.879> guy<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.449> closeout<00:01:02.839> situations<00:01:03.080> I

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
the open guy and closeout situations I

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.350 
the open guy and closeout situations I
think<00:01:03.769> those<00:01:03.920> are<00:01:03.949> all<00:01:04.220> positive<00:01:04.699> for<00:01:04.940> us<00:01:05.089> and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
think those are all positive for us and

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.210 
think those are all positive for us and
you<00:01:06.259> know<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.710> those<00:01:06.770> things<00:01:06.890> that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
you know it's one of those things that

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.609 
you know it's one of those things that
when<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:08.240> came<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:08.600> our<00:01:08.780> first<00:01:08.990> two<00:01:09.200> games<00:01:09.380> a

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
when we came out our first two games a

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.170 
when we came out our first two games a
great<00:01:10.040> job<00:01:10.250> at<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.640> ball<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
great job at the ball and now the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.990 
great job at the ball and now the
defenses<00:01:11.720> are<00:01:11.869> adjusting<00:01:12.380> my<00:01:12.500> silver<00:01:12.880> back<00:01:13.880> to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
defenses are adjusting my silver back to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.609 
defenses are adjusting my silver back to
the<00:01:14.090> drawing<00:01:14.300> board<00:01:14.450> figure<00:01:14.990> out<00:01:15.110> what<00:01:15.229> kind

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.670 
the hall it is that a difficult
transition<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> big<00:01:27.830> transition<00:01:28.190> ah<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:30.530> it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.220 
than what we've shot why do you think
you<00:03:06.940> guys<00:03:07.060> getting<00:03:07.389> it<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.600> website<00:03:08.079> or

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you guys getting it on website or

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.680 
you guys getting it on website or
something<00:03:08.500> about<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:09.329> why<00:03:10.329> are<00:03:10.389> we<00:03:10.540> getting

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
something about that why are we getting

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.319 
something about that why are we getting
ruts<00:03:11.079> yeah<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.060> way<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.239> game

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
ruts yeah that's just the way the game

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.069 
ruts yeah that's just the way the game
can<00:03:13.720> go<00:03:13.900> up<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.290> down<00:03:14.440> sometimes<00:03:14.769> but<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:16.079> think

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
can go up and down sometimes but I think

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.140 
can go up and down sometimes but I think
it<00:03:17.230> goes<00:03:17.530> back<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.069> where<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.639> solution<00:03:19.120> is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
it goes back to where the solution is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.370 
it goes back to where the solution is
getting<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.630> these<00:03:19.720> rest<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.230> just

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
getting out of these rest is just

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.430 
getting out of these rest is just
putting<00:03:20.980> your<00:03:21.160> head<00:03:21.310> down<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:22.109> out<00:03:23.109> working

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
putting your head down and out working

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.379 
putting your head down and out working
the<00:03:23.560> other<00:03:23.709> team<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.700> usually<00:03:24.910> gets<00:03:25.209> you

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
the other team and that usually gets you

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.829 
the other team and that usually gets you
out<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.569> there<00:03:25.780> that's<00:03:26.380> over<00:03:26.650> you
