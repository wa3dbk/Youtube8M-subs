00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.819
 yes 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.080
 you are as important to me as I 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 it was for his mother and father and I swore to them 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 that I would protect it and I have not done it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.930
 the mayor is going to fire him in the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 spring seriously 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 how they thought they could live so 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.890
 luxuriously mind and leave either for the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.890
 rest of us 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.650
 what does this rebellion mean 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.430
 You will have my permission to die 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.600
 ah
