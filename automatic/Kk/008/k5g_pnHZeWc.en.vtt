00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
there as well so there's a possibility

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.540 
there as well so there's a possibility
we'll<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> wig<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.160> it'd<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.370> cool

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
we'll get the wig and so it'd be cool

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.710 
we'll get the wig and so it'd be cool
because<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.360> we're<00:02:18.480> kind<00:02:18.660> of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
because the one thing that we're kind of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.420 
because the one thing that we're kind of
missing<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.200> game<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.500> far<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.890> Vegeta's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
missing in this game so far is Vegeta's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.820 
missing in this game so far is Vegeta's
hair<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.660> looking<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:21.990> least<00:02:22.170> through<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> wig

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
hair so looking at least through the wig

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.200 
hair so looking at least through the wig
even<00:02:23.280> person<00:02:23.490> super<00:02:23.640> saying<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> Super<00:02:24.180> Saiyan

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
even person super saying a Super Saiyan

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.610 
even person super saying a Super Saiyan
will<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.510> pretty<00:02:24.780> cool<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> guess<00:02:25.440> we'll

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
will be pretty cool so I guess we'll

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.440 
will be pretty cool so I guess we'll
have<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.160> wait<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:27.210> soon<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.390> I
