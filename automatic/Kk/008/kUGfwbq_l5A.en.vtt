in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.659> clip<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:00.989> gonna<00:00:01.079> be<00:00:01.260> talking

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
in this clip we're gonna be talking

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.320 
in this clip we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:01.770> what<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.250> do<00:00:02.399> when<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.850> don't<00:00:03.000> have<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
about what to do when you don't have a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.780 
about what to do when you don't have a
real<00:00:03.689> Hammond<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.200> stage<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.100> lot<00:00:05.670> of

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
real Hammond on stage with you a lot of

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.400 
real Hammond on stage with you a lot of
times<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.270> just<00:00:06.299> don't<00:00:06.480> have<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> size<00:00:07.109> or

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
times you just don't have the size or

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.890 
times you just don't have the size or
the<00:00:07.500> stage<00:00:07.799> or<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.389> capability<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.660> a

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
the stage or the capability to have a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.749 
the stage or the capability to have a
real<00:00:10.320> organ<00:00:10.679> there<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.130> want<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.370> sound

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
real organ there but you want that sound

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
real organ there but you want that sound
so<00:00:12.120> we're<00:00:12.809> gonna<00:00:12.929> talk<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> couple<00:00:13.559> ways

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
so we're gonna talk about a couple ways

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.039 
so we're gonna talk about a couple ways
that<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:15.420> first<00:00:15.660> option

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that you can get that the first option

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
that you can get that the first option
is<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.980> play<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> keyboard<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.090> organ

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
is to just play a keyboard with an organ

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.570 
is to just play a keyboard with an organ
patch<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.900> typically<00:00:19.619> you'll<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.859> three

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
patch on it typically you'll have three

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
patch on it typically you'll have three
or<00:00:20.699> four<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.029> organ<00:00:21.600> sounds<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.289> now

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
or four different organ sounds and now

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.170 
or four different organ sounds and now
that<00:00:22.710> you've<00:00:22.830> seen<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> ways<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that you've seen some of the ways that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580 
that you've seen some of the ways that
you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.600> different<00:00:24.750> sounds<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.410> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you can get different sounds off that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.900 
you can get different sounds off that
you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.740> start<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.519> kinds<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you can start to see what kinds of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
you can start to see what kinds of
drawbar<00:00:27.359> settings<00:00:27.750> they're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> be

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
drawbar settings they're going to be

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
drawbar settings they're going to be
emulating<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> problem<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
emulating but the problem with that is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
emulating but the problem with that is
you<00:00:30.420> typically<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.080> can't<00:00:31.320> change<00:00:31.590> those

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you typically you can't change those

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.680 
you typically you can't change those
drawbar<00:00:32.340> settings<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
drawbar settings you just it's take this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.190 
drawbar settings you just it's take this
patch<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> next<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.960> that's<00:00:36.960> not

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
patch or take the next one so that's not

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.540 
patch or take the next one so that's not
recommended<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.219> want<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
recommended if you really want it to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
recommended if you really want it to
sound<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> Hammond<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.350> stage

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
sound like a like a Hammond on on stage

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430 
sound like a like a Hammond on on stage
that's<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> best<00:00:41.790> way<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that's that's not the best way to go the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's that's not the best way to go the
other<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> take<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> play

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
other way is to take you know is to play

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
other way is to take you know is to play
what<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.870> call<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.280> Hammond<00:00:47.280> simulator<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
what they call a Hammond simulator or a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.650 
what they call a Hammond simulator or a
tone<00:00:48.390> wheel<00:00:48.600> simulator<00:00:50.270> basically<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.390> organ

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
tone wheel simulator basically an organ

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.880 
tone wheel simulator basically an organ
simulator<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> another<00:00:52.500> type<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
simulator and it's another type of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
simulator and it's another type of
keyboard<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.730> type<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.180> called<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> Nord

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
keyboard this type is called a Nord

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.920 
keyboard this type is called a Nord
electro<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> ton<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> different

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
electro there are a ton of different

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
electro there are a ton of different
brands<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.680> different<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.850> know

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
brands out there and different you know

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.529 
brands out there and different you know
different<00:01:00.329> types<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:01.879> generators<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
different types of generators but this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
different types of generators but this
they<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.100> basically<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
they you know they all basically do the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
they you know they all basically do the
same<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
same thing they're gonna all going to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
same thing they're gonna all going to
have<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.619> sort<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> drawbar<00:01:08.460> simulator

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
have some sort of drawbar simulator

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
have some sort of drawbar simulator
which<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.510> case<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.990> pushing<00:01:10.350> buttons

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
which in this case it's pushing buttons

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850 
which in this case it's pushing buttons
down<00:01:10.920> instead<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.200> instead<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> moving<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
down instead of instead of moving the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.859 
down instead of instead of moving the
drum<00:01:14.189> bars<00:01:14.400> themselves<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.330> see

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.990 

you<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> same<00:01:25.320> effect<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:26.700> even<00:01:26.880> got

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you get the same effect it's even got

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
you get the same effect it's even got
the<00:01:27.030> percussion<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the percussion so you can put that in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
the percussion so you can put that in
there<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> hear<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.409> there's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
there you can hear that there there's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
there you can hear that there there's
even<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> vibrato<00:01:40.610> simulating<00:01:41.610> those<00:01:41.700> same

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
even the vibrato simulating those same

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
even the vibrato simulating those same
kinds<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> things<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.810> even<00:01:43.140> split<00:01:43.409> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
kinds of things you can even split this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
kinds of things you can even split this
up<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.789> simulate<00:01:45.390> having

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
up so you know you can simulate having

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.149 
up so you know you can simulate having
two<00:01:46.110> different<00:01:46.470> keyboards<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.039> have

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
two different keyboards and you have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.649 
two different keyboards and you have
different<00:01:47.460> settings<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.820> those<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.390> know

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
different settings for those so you know

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
different settings for those so you know
you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> split<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.920> also<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> most

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
