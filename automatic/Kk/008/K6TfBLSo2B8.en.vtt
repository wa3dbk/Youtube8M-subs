it's<00:00:59.969> hard<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.230> on

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's hard for me to do it like this on

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
it's hard for me to do it like this on
the<00:01:01.680> video<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.300> kind<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the video but you can see it's kind of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.830 
the video but you can see it's kind of
like<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> wraparound<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> wraparound<00:01:05.840> top

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
like a wraparound it's a wraparound top

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
like a wraparound it's a wraparound top
that<00:01:07.320> goes<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> eight-foot<00:01:08.640> extended

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that goes I have it eight-foot extended

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780 
that goes I have it eight-foot extended
this<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.890> 28<00:01:11.460> foot

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
this way and I think it's like 28 foot

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
this way and I think it's like 28 foot
going<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.110> wall<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
going on the wall and then it it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
going on the wall and then it it
terminates<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:16.409> another

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
terminates over here at another another

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
terminates over here at another another
let<00:01:18.150> me<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:18.900> eight

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
let me see if I can get on there eight

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.710 
let me see if I can get on there eight
foot<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> wraps<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:20.790> now

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
foot so you can see it wraps around now

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.609 
foot so you can see it wraps around now
over<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:24.000> done<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.659> I've

y'all make sure that you pay attention
to<00:03:37.609> your<00:03:37.700> mother's<00:03:38.120> when<00:03:38.660> they're<00:03:38.810> trying<00:03:39.109> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
to your mother's when they're trying to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.400 
to your mother's when they're trying to
teach<00:03:39.470> all<00:03:39.739> about<00:03:40.130> math<00:03:40.450> because<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:42.109> almost

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
teach all about math because in almost

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.550 
teach all about math because in almost
everything<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:43.040> do<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.389> life<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:45.260> going

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
everything you do in this life is going

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.400 
everything you do in this life is going
to<00:03:45.709> involve<00:03:45.950> math<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.150> can't<00:03:47.569> you<00:03:47.989> cannot

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
to involve math and you can't you cannot

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.979 
to involve math and you can't you cannot
build<00:03:48.980> these<00:03:49.880> cabinets<00:03:50.389> without<00:03:50.660> knowing

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
build these cabinets without knowing

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.190 
build these cabinets without knowing
math<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.470> can't<00:03:51.709> build<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.630> block<00:03:53.630> home<00:03:53.870> or<00:03:54.109> at

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
math you can't build a block home or at

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.319 
math you can't build a block home or at
home<00:03:54.349> laying<00:03:54.829> block<00:03:55.099> without<00:03:55.760> knowing<00:03:56.180> how<00:03:56.269> to

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
home laying block without knowing how to

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.199 
home laying block without knowing how to
do<00:03:56.510> math<00:03:56.889> so<00:03:57.889> you<00:03:58.459> can't<00:03:58.700> frame<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.030> house

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
do math so you can't frame the house

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.080 
do math so you can't frame the house
without<00:03:59.630> knowing<00:04:00.019> how<00:04:00.139> to<00:04:00.200> do<00:04:00.380> math<00:04:00.669> so<00:04:01.669> if<00:04:01.940> you

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
without knowing how to do math so if you

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.789 
without knowing how to do math so if you
know<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.329> want<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.510> be<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> builder<00:04:03.139> you<00:04:03.620> need

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
know you want to be a builder you need

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.860 
know you want to be a builder you need
to<00:04:03.889> become<00:04:04.040> an<00:04:04.310> expert<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.879> math<00:04:05.180> learning<00:04:05.510> all

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
to become an expert in math learning all

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.380 
to become an expert in math learning all
that<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.409> can<00:04:06.680> about<00:04:07.400> MAV<00:04:07.700> at<00:04:07.879> least<00:04:08.120> up<00:04:08.360> to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
that you can about MAV at least up to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.500 
that you can about MAV at least up to
algebra<00:04:08.959> little<00:04:09.200> bit

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
algebra little bit

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.320 
algebra little bit
geometry<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.920> y'all<00:04:11.129> children<00:04:11.549> pay<00:04:11.730> attention

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
geometry so y'all children pay attention

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.080 
geometry so y'all children pay attention
to<00:04:13.140> your<00:04:13.260> mother's<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.739> your<00:04:13.890> fathers<00:04:14.370> are<00:04:14.400> in

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
because you're going to need math and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.870 
because you're going to need math and
read<00:04:18.930> books<00:04:19.169> read<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> lot<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.949> books<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.850> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
read books read a lot of books so that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.390 
read books read a lot of books so that
your<00:04:21.120> comprehension<00:04:21.780> metal<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.590> actually<00:04:23.010> go

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
your comprehension metal can actually go

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.890 
your comprehension metal can actually go
up<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.000> majority<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.419> tests<00:04:24.720> out

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
up because the majority of tests out

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.939 
up because the majority of tests out
there<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.199> world<00:04:25.290> has<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.680> do<00:04:25.800> with

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
there in the world has to do with

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.550 
there in the world has to do with
reading<00:04:26.250> comprehension<00:04:26.340> anyway<00:04:27.229> yeah<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.289> have

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
reading comprehension anyway yeah I have

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.320 
reading comprehension anyway yeah I have
a<00:04:28.590> blessed<00:04:29.250> day<00:04:29.370> if<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> want<00:04:30.120> something
