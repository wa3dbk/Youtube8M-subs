00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.939
 chicharrones in well easy red sauce 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.950
 to do right away I will share my 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.480
 way to make them these are the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.630
 ingredients that we are going to occupy 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.840
 chicharrÃ³n that I have this portfolio that 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.970
 they already come off like this in the store but 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.820
 can buy if he does not say he is one 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.879
 good big and do it in bits and 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.879
 is 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.480
 As you like, we also occupy 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.920
 here two chiles puya a guajillo chile and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.720
 here I have five Japanese chilies I have 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.660
 here thyme marjoram a pinch of each 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.080
 a bit a piece of onion and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.110
 three whole black peppers here already 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.199
 I have my chiles and hydrate them and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.390
 I will remove the tail also I will occupy 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.360
 I'll make a little bit of butter 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.369
 with butter but if you do not not 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.399
 they like that way they can use oil 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:21.399
 here I have a third teaspoon of 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:26.560
 garlic powder two tomatoes salt to taste and 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.789
 the water is already how it depends on how 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.429
 they want me here I have 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.190
 about two cups of water but 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.890
 if I need it if I look at what 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.860
 missing for a little 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.470
 caldito our pork cracklings then 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.840
 you have to add a little more water and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 this recipe is very easy because the only thing 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.120
 what are we going to do is all these 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.790
 ingredients we are going to liquefy 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.550
 We'll put the butter in a 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.590
 pan in a pot to fry our 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.500
 sauce and when you have our sauce 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.810
 list already fried a little then 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 we're just going to add our 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.560
 greaves 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.700
 and then chance because you have to look 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.360
 there's that I'm chatting last because 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.150
 our pork rinds are already a little 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.459
 they contain salt then better this this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.430
 step you have to leave it at the end for 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.350
 only if the evidence is not missing 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.630
 add 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.070
 then the preparation of 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.070
 pork rinds in red sauce 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590
 and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 do not 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.690
 as you see right now is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.630
 boiling then right now we're going to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.020
 look you have to throw salt will let 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.020
 to take salt is already as I said I already is 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.840
 the taste and you also have to lower the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.650
 fire and depending as they measure it from 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.930
 caldito 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.599
 I think to leave about 10 minutes and be 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.799
 proving that we look good and it is 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.560
 depending if they want it more because 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.720
 greaves absorb enough water as 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.080
 come 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.120
 then this is already the taste and 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.060
 after about 10 minutes they were going to stay 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.010
 ready to serve 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.970
 This is the result of how we 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.530
 the pork rinds were left in red sauce 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.230
 as they saw I just put him there 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.680
 a few sprigs of coriander to accompany 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.590
 but as they realized they are nothing 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.380
 of complicated I hope the recipe is 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.419
 of your liking in the way that says how 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.070
 I always tell them down in the little box 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.280
 description are all the ingredients 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.830
 those that you can find me if you liked 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.050
