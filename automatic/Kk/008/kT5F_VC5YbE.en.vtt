00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
lineman I'll just tell them to get on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
lineman I'll just tell them to get on
their<00:01:29.909> dots<00:01:30.210> every<00:01:30.600> day<00:01:30.780> each<00:01:31.590> lineman<00:01:32.130> will

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
their dots every day each lineman will

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.460 
their dots every day each lineman will
grab<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> spot<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.060> practice<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> dot<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.439> can

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
grab a spot to practice on a dot we can

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
grab a spot to practice on a dot we can
work<00:01:35.070> through<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> footwork<00:01:36.390> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
work through some of the footwork on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
work through some of the footwork on
these<00:01:37.229> drills<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.220> end<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.640> another

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these drills and they end up on another

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
these drills and they end up on another
dot<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.420> separates<00:01:39.900> them<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.619> have

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
dot it separates them all so they have

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010 
dot it separates them all so they have
space<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> work<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> operate<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.780> also

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
space to work and operate but it also

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.679 
space to work and operate but it also
does<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.220> makes<00:01:44.729> us<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.090> efficient<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
does is it makes us very efficient in

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
does is it makes us very efficient in
our<00:01:45.720> practice<00:01:46.170> time<00:01:46.350> instead<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.799> five
