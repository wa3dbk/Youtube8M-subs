00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
and I decided to throw a Pokeball
because<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.350> mini-map<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.309> thought

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because there is no mini-map the thought

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
because there is no mini-map the thought
process<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.390> maybe<00:01:06.689> I'll<00:01:06.840> get

process there was well maybe I'll get
extra<00:01:07.260> points<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:09.210> friendly<00:01:09.720> spots

is<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.350> rely<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
is you really have to rely on your

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
is you really have to rely on your
headset<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.759> sounds<00:01:27.600> what's<00:01:27.780> coming

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
across and I actually whack a guy

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
across and I actually whack a guy
because<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.720> hear<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:32.159> towards

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because I hear something I look towards

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.399 
because I hear something I look towards
the<00:01:32.820> direction<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> friendly<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.110> sound

the direction of the friendly the sound

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
the direction of the friendly the sound
doesn't<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:34.860> sense<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.759> give<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
