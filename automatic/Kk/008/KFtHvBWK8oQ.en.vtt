00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.040
 most beautiful, all young lovers 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 engines and welcome this new one 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.790
 episode of we discover the engine 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.440
 today as requested by the youtubers cones 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.040
 we will explain the operation of the engine 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.689
 I also said rotary the engine 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.840
 wankel is an internal combustion engine 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.060
 rotary type since the piston does not 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.510
 moves in rectilinear alternating motion but 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.050
 wheel around an axis was presented 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.330
 in 1957 from felix quant is the first 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.280
 car driven by a wankel fu engine 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.989
 in 1963 the nsu spider despite the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.489
 rotor pier had a displacement of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.100
 only 498 cc develops a power of 50 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.729
 horses and pushed the car to over 150 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.199
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.120
 Now let's skip the story and talk about the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.860
 its functioning 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.890
 the wankel operating principle 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.950
 it's very simple with pistoia 3 lobby 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.140
 redness rotates eccentrically around 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.030
 to the crankshaft generating with his 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.850
 moving work chambers inside 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.920
 of which are performed cyclically 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.890
 four classes that talk about that of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.570
 combustion and suction compression 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.800
 exhaust 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.800
 let's talk about its advantages 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.550
 fewer moving parts 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.100
 with the least noise and minor 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.140
 high vibration due to lightness 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.800
 to the reduced and elevated dimensions 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.479
 a lower weight ratio power 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 pollutant emission of nitrogen oxides 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.330
 due to lower average temperatures of 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.160
 gas still greater power at the same level 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.830
 displacement compared to a motor has 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.300
 need an alternative simplicity 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.600
 design and maintenance of the disadvantages 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.780
 however, only poor durability of the elements 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.570
 tightness of the torque rotor contained in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.759
 low consumption rotation rates of 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 fuel in general greater respect 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.000
 to the problematic alternative engine 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.130
 lubrication of the apical segments and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.040
 rate behind much unburned carbides 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.170
 high volume can therefore be inferred that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 the wankel engine is for enthusiasts 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.630
 regardless of consumption and costs 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.580
 management and maintenance of this type of 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.860
 engine can also be equipped with 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 supercharging systems like one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.400
 turbine or volumetric compressor 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.280
 at the moment the mankell is developed 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.319
 only from the mazda in fact the only one 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.360
 car rotary engine approved for 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.650
 road present on the market currently 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.990
 is the famous rx8 the finished masa of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 produce the engine of the rx 8 in 2012 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.220
 but he is working on new projects 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.110
 innovative on rotary promising to 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.110
 enthusiasts to produce new cars of the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.280
 within the next five years 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.260
 let's finish this presentation 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.250
 listening to the mythical sound of this 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 fantastic engine 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.650
 1 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 Yes No 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.580
 no
