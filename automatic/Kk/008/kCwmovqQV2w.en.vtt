00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
will come out of the machine so be very

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.340 
will come out of the machine so be very

sometimes get thrown out the back of the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.029 
sometimes get thrown out the back of the
wall<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:28.090> would<00:04:28.360> recommend<00:04:29.200> having<00:04:29.860> other

show<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.560> guys<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> real<00:04:33.160> safe<00:04:33.490> way<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:34.030> doing

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
show you guys a real safe way of doing

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.580 
show you guys a real safe way of doing
that<00:04:34.780> here<00:04:35.020> in<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.140> moment

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
that here in a moment

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.500 
that here in a moment
so<00:04:35.860> yeah<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.130> players<00:04:36.310> can<00:04:36.610> stand<00:04:36.880> back<00:04:37.030> here

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
so yeah the players can stand back here

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.080 
so yeah the players can stand back here
and<00:04:37.720> hang<00:04:38.380> out<00:04:38.470> by<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.620> mystery<00:04:38.919> box<00:04:39.130> hit<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
the zombies they can stand pretty close

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.659 
the zombies they can stand pretty close
to<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> doorway<00:04:44.979> right<00:04:45.220> there<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.580> be

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
to that doorway right there and be

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.490 
to that doorway right there and be
pretty<00:04:45.850> safe<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.110> way<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.200> pick<00:04:47.410> up

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
pretty safe so the way to pick up

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.920 
pretty safe so the way to pick up
power-ups<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.310> safe<00:04:48.550> way<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.390> have<00:04:49.510> monkeys

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
power-ups a safe way is to have monkeys

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.050 
power-ups a safe way is to have monkeys
and<00:04:50.140> throw<00:04:50.500> them<00:04:50.680> out<00:04:50.890> that<00:04:51.250> doorway<00:04:51.669> over

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
and throw them out that doorway over

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.140 
and throw them out that doorway over
there<00:04:52.180> on<00:04:52.630> top<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.530> couch<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.340> once<00:04:55.060> you

there on top of that couch and once you

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.550 
there on top of that couch and once you
throw<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:55.479> out<00:04:55.510> it's<00:04:55.810> going<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.020> clear<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
