00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.770
 and good and nothing else to complement what 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.830
 from the previous video some things that 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.109
 they missed this one I did not say them anymore because 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.920
 we have served so long but in this 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 then saying is a do not do it not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.680
 do this is important do not go to your 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 dog to your puppy do not harm it when 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.650
 come your house a lot of people have the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.320
 belief that when you arrive you can 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.500
 bathe or you look like people or 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 once a week they do not see it, it's not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 Organize your dog far from here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.210
 all your shots this means 3 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.720
 three and a half months really do not win it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.970
 and another thing and that is in your house not what 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.890
 let you enter the kitchen too and I 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.600
 I recommend you pay attention 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 not to enter the kitchen because you think 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.270
 what they are cooking or something is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.070
 there may be something left and he for the dog 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.839
 then you can burn it too and half 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.000
 also the food extra of the floor does not 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.970
 they realize then all recipes 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.890
 will be raising and can this eat 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.240
 what you have fallen and with more 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.940
 Puppies remember that you can not 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.830
 many things then teaches our 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.710
 the kitchen puts the restriction god and in 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 your house you already have your kitchen has a door 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.200
 well and teach them not to enter and if not 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.970
 door has limited it teaches that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
 stay out there when they 're there 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.100
 in something else also that is 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.490
 important is that when you are 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.170
 eating do not let it jump when you 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.910
 they are eating part of the meals but 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.280
 After a while, he will get used to it. 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.229
 make that bad habit and then this one 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.119
 Well, if they have a medium or large dog 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.009
 when it goes up as high as possible 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.320
 reach and it's not going to be very comfortable to 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.810
 Chiquito not you from people who 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.310
 subject to the one that rises to grab it with 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.720
 then they are eating enjoying 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.670
 you have to eat him 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 it has to be in place without being 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.080
 bothering it is important to get 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 from young children this crisis will cost 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.240
 a little work if you do not do not know 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.369
 wants is for 503 young people because he insists 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.380
 being with you skipping is something that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 I recommend that you mark it take in 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.209
 this is not necessarily far or 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040
 they are apart from me that they did it in a 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.810
 fourth something but if you can tie it to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.850
 a considerable distance where they are 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 in what you learn that you should not 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.200
 They are and getting to where they are 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.560
 eating and less high then that's 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 one other things that you should not do and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 Finally there are other recommendations that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.130
 you also agree when you have to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
 little puppy in your house is to give 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.019
 boiled water or jug water or something 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.069
 so do not give them water from the tap because 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.069
 it's more palencia is sick 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.190
 As I mentioned in the video above the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.290
 portions of food but in this case it's 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.590
 feed him 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.209
 you see they are 34 is a day and try 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.950
 feed him always at the same time 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.500
 daily if you want to say if you give 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 eat at 8 I do not know at 3 in the afternoon 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.829
 to the grace of the night always analyzed 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.989
 number I want exactly at 8 in 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.689
 point of the gods you can give between 8 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.579
 and half three and a half four things like that a 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.890
 but that is always between those 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.319
 same hours because that way the dog is going to 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.980
 accustom 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.749
 and this is going to get used to eating those 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.689
 hours and it will also serve you for 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:25.879
 When you do the bathroom, be used to 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.050
 your organism precisely to do also 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.880
 to the same areas 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.210
 in another video we will also explain 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.790
 the training of 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.010
 how to teach him to do when you want 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.720
 make the bathroom where you want it to make 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.640
 let's explain our video and also 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.050
 to serve them to feed them 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.420
 hours and I recommend that when it is 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.310
 in your house you buy a necklace he cited a 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.780
 lath cited for you to put it on the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.410
 neck to get used to the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.910
 necklace this is so that it serves to give and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.130
 for especially the necklace he cited to make 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.790
 Noise noise because of two issues 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.480
 The first is that your dog is the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.790
 tiny 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.530
 It extends to get a lot between the legs or 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.060
 get behind you then in 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.459
 Sometimes we begin to realize that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 is behind that was behind you and the 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.819
 move you can step on it and hurt 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.949
 then we went through services that 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.479
 it suddenly injures veterinarians because what 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.910
 They trod leg hurt us 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.440
 then waters and if you put a crests 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.060
 and that noise is going to be more 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.400
 Be aware of when you get close 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.979
 towards you and two you will not get used to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.560
 attract something for when you put the 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.930
 necklace that you want me to bring and this one does not 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.449
 be so difficult because when suddenly 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.729
 if you want to take it to the street already when 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.680
 you can take it out and again the one that is 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.169
 put the collar to the operator and in the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.300
 strap is a little watch then allow 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.740
 that you get used to today in another video 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.600
 we are also going to talk about what 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.330
 you need to know for when 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.460
 want to take out the passion and also you 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.990
 you can give a little something 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.180
 resistant so that they do not bite the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.070
 Puppies like very much to be like 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.050
 Pulling the cloth like you get it 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.940
 then be the poplars 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.350
 it is a recommendation of some cloth 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.030
 so that the seaweed and I'm isolated the 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.139
 cloth very often because it sentences very 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.270
 fast then 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.570
 that is, it will suddenly bring everything quickly 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.009
 dirty and dragged muddy is not about 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.800
 wash those followed so you're not 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.430
 dirty that's all about the festivity the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.430
 complement
