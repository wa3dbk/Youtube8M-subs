00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.840
 obscure or anything but that's me 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.810
 makes it seem like it's a zero at the dock 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.150
 in a thoumine mine with lots of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 why I took this card I find 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.370
 that she in a valve in a tsunami 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 in a back tower 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.520
 gorgeous as you see behind 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.040
 pretty stylish frankly it's beautiful 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 in addition to surrounding them with bordeaux rekom 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.480
 it's like the previous one 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 he really looks fierce and me it's me 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.000
 please I would have liked 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530
 have this card I like this 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.140
 map 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 here are the friends so we go to the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.800
 next position with an absolute ex 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.330
 crowd so why did I take this 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.430
 map 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 so because we actually like it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.100
 go to illuminate it changes 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.920
 early colors I found these cards 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.120
 original actually it's an absolute 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.580
 here I found original and 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600
 I wanted to put it in my top 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.130
 so do not be afraid to laugh if you like 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 this kind of campus white board case has 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.100
 never had too many cards with white board 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530
 like that actually i find that pretty 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.090
 stylish in itself the pokemon is pretty good 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.720
 highlighted good he is not very 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.070
 worked 1 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.020
 but there are small etc the years around 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.920
 and then raped effect and black 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.460
 rose blue 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 astier there is enough friends there 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.880
 next position with kubla leather is 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.220
 Excluded the adventurous black ex crowd art 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.860
 so I'm pretty fan of this pokemon 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.330
 I had the opportunity to catch him in ex and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.550
 really stylish there is a whirlwind 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.800

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.060
 kind a little dark pokemon but 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.739
