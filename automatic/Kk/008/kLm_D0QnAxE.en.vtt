lower<00:01:43.200> level<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.920> Hawkeye<00:01:44.640> I've<00:01:44.850> done<00:01:45.000> some

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
lower level than Hawkeye I've done some

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
lower level than Hawkeye I've done some
upgrades<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.680> he

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
upgrades but just to show you how he

upgrades but just to show you how he
fights<00:01:47.040> let's<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> spider-man<00:01:48.240> versus

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
fights let's do a spider-man versus

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
fights let's do a spider-man versus
Hawkeye<00:01:49.590> type<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.040> fair<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.369> believe<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Hawkeye type of fair I believe this is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.050 
Hawkeye type of fair I believe this is
free-to-play<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.530> allows<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.909> in

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
free-to-play and it allows you to go in

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
free-to-play and it allows you to go in
and<00:01:54.210> purchase<00:01:54.420> extra<00:01:54.750> characters<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.619> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and purchase extra characters if you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
and purchase extra characters if you
want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> unlock<00:01:57.600> them

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
want to I'm sure you can unlock them

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
want to I'm sure you can unlock them
over<00:01:58.079> time<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.530> you'll<00:01:58.860> need<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> spend<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
over time but you'll need to spend a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.240 
over time but you'll need to spend a
while<00:01:59.700> doing<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:01.130> incidentally<00:02:02.130> also

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
while doing so right incidentally also

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
while doing so right incidentally also
the<00:02:02.579> last<00:02:02.700> thing<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> mention<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> that

I'm going to slide in deuces beat
attacks<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:17.770> jump<00:02:18.430> away<00:02:18.670> cause<00:02:19.450> he's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
attacks and then jump away cause he's

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.360 
attacks and then jump away cause he's
spider-man<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.140> he's<00:02:20.230> frisky<00:02:20.740> like<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
spider-man and he's frisky like that you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.250 
spider-man and he's frisky like that you
can<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.700> combos<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.630> idea<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.170> do

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
can do combos so the idea is you like do

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.660 
can do combos so the idea is you like do
a<00:02:23.290> couple<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.590> light<00:02:23.770> attacks<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.220> then<00:02:24.310> swipe

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
a couple of light attacks and then swipe

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.040 
a couple of light attacks and then swipe
like<00:02:24.940> I'm<00:02:25.120> doing<00:02:25.360> here<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.720> some<00:02:25.870> heavy

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
like I'm doing here and do some heavy

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.600 
like I'm doing here and do some heavy
attacks<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.010> gives<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:27.550> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
attacks and that gives you a kind of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.540 
attacks and that gives you a kind of
combo<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.870> moment<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:30.160> haven't<00:02:30.310> showed

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
combo at the moment they haven't showed

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.550 
combo at the moment they haven't showed
us<00:02:30.670> any<00:02:30.820> new<00:02:31.120> controls<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:31.960> just<00:02:32.170> tapping

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
us any new controls it's just tapping

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.320 
us any new controls it's just tapping
and<00:02:32.740> swiping<00:02:32.980> forwards<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:33.730> backwards<00:02:33.760> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
and swiping forwards or backwards and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.360 
and swiping forwards or backwards and
activating<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.140> special<00:02:35.530> power<00:02:35.740> by<00:02:36.130> tapping

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
activating that special power by tapping

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.980 
activating that special power by tapping
the<00:02:36.580> icon<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.000> lower<00:02:37.240> left<00:02:37.330> hand<00:02:37.600> side<00:02:37.870> of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
the icon in the lower left hand side of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.060 
the icon in the lower left hand side of
the<00:02:38.050> screen<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.620> very<00:02:38.770> simple

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
the screen so it's a very simple

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.730 
the screen so it's a very simple
streamlined<00:02:39.490> combat<00:02:40.090> system<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.740> arguably

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
streamlined combat system but arguably

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.860 
streamlined combat system but arguably
to<00:02:42.250> me<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.670> feels<00:02:42.910> better<00:02:43.150> than<00:02:43.450> things<00:02:43.750> like

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
to me it feels better than things like

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.180 
to me it feels better than things like
Batman<00:02:44.800> Arkham<00:02:45.760> lockdown<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.470> Superman

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
Batman Arkham lockdown and the Superman

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
Batman Arkham lockdown and the Superman
game<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.730> came<00:02:48.880> out<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.210> were<00:02:49.270> all<00:02:49.390> gesture

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
game that came out they were all gesture

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.230 
game that came out they were all gesture
based<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.530> they<00:02:50.860> just<00:02:51.010> felt<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.430> slow<00:02:51.970> and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
based but they just felt really slow and

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.480 
based but they just felt really slow and
clunky<00:02:52.570> whereas<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.710> feels<00:02:53.980> very<00:02:54.040> very

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
clunky whereas this feels very very

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.980 
clunky whereas this feels very very
sharp<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.000> fast<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.480> immediate<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.930> I'm

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
sharp and fast and immediate and I'm

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.950 
sharp and fast and immediate and I'm
playing<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.500> an<00:02:57.000> iPod<00:02:58.000> 5th<00:02:58.330> gen<00:02:58.630> which<00:02:58.810> is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
playing this on an iPod 5th gen which is

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.130 
playing this on an iPod 5th gen which is
the<00:02:59.080> equivalent<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.470> an<00:02:59.590> i<00:02:59.710> phone<00:03:00.400> 4s<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.330> it's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the equivalent of an i phone 4s and it's

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.990 
the equivalent of an i phone 4s and it's
still<00:03:02.410> very<00:03:02.740> sharp<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.310> very<00:03:03.490> smooth<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
still very sharp and very smooth and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.160 
still very sharp and very smooth and
very<00:03:04.090> fast<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.540> I'm<00:03:04.660> actually<00:03:04.810> quite

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
very fast so I'm actually quite

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.330 
very fast so I'm actually quite
impressed<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.650> how<00:03:05.740> well<00:03:05.770> it's<00:03:06.100> it's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
impressed with how well it's it's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.070 
impressed with how well it's it's
running<00:03:06.760> don't<00:03:07.330> expect<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.900> be

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
running don't expect it to be

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.600 
running don't expect it to be
particularly<00:03:08.350> deep<00:03:08.740> going<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.430> it's

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
particularly deep going in it's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.750 
particularly deep going in it's
certainly<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.480> super<00:03:11.020> complex<00:03:11.440> fighter<00:03:12.220> at

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
certainly not a super complex fighter at

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.940 
certainly not a super complex fighter at
least<00:03:12.940> not<00:03:13.120> at<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.240> moment<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:14.230> err<00:03:14.290> I'm

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
least not at the moment but err I'm

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.530 
least not at the moment but err I'm
impressed<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.550> apparently<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.240> heal

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
impressed so apparently you can heal

can so here's the ISO eight stuff to

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.750 
can so here's the ISO eight stuff to
level<00:05:34.599> him<00:05:34.690> up<00:05:34.780> I<00:05:34.900> have<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.110> drag<00:05:35.440> here<00:05:36.370> we<00:05:36.490> go

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
level him up I have to drag here we go

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.820 
level him up I have to drag here we go
and<00:05:37.090> drop<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.479> into<00:05:37.690> there<00:05:38.110> that's<00:05:38.590> level

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
and drop that into there that's level

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.499 
and drop that into there that's level
damn<00:05:38.979> up<00:05:39.070> to<00:05:39.190> level<00:05:39.400> two<00:05:39.610> so<00:05:39.849> I<00:05:39.880> can<00:05:40.000> upgrade

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
damn up to level two so I can upgrade

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.540 
damn up to level two so I can upgrade
it'll<00:05:41.139> also<00:05:41.229> cost<00:05:41.470> me<00:05:41.680> currency<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.310> do<00:05:42.430> it

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
it'll also cost me currency to do it

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.649 
it'll also cost me currency to do it
clearly<00:05:42.909> so<00:05:43.870> if<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:44.050> do<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:45.090> he<00:05:46.090> has<00:05:46.270> leveled

upgrade like we just did you can also
use<00:06:14.680> crystals<00:06:15.070> to<00:06:15.280> get<00:06:15.820> new<00:06:16.030> characters<00:06:16.600> these

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780

hero crystals right here you can
purchase<00:06:18.729> individually<00:06:19.539> I<00:06:19.570> don't<00:06:19.960> know<00:06:20.080> the

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
purchase individually I don't know the

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.110 
purchase individually I don't know the
conversion<00:06:20.710> rate<00:06:20.889> for<00:06:21.220> Danish<00:06:21.520> currency<00:06:22.030> I'm

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
conversion rate for Danish currency I'm

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.810 
conversion rate for Danish currency I'm
afraid<00:06:22.449> so<00:06:23.050> you'll<00:06:23.500> have<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:23.770> just<00:06:23.919> imagine<00:06:24.160> or

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
afraid so you'll have to just imagine or

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.010 
afraid so you'll have to just imagine or
that<00:06:25.060> you<00:06:25.120> can<00:06:25.270> wait<00:06:25.449> for<00:06:25.600> them<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.720> unlock

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
that you can wait for them to unlock

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.480 
that you can wait for them to unlock
organically<00:06:26.590> three<00:06:26.860> hours<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.250> forty

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
organically three hours and forty

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.890 
organically three hours and forty
minutes<00:06:27.520> here<00:06:27.940> and<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.210> daily<00:06:28.539> crystal

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
minutes here and the daily crystal

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.750 
minutes here and the daily crystal
appears<00:06:29.470> once<00:06:29.680> every<00:06:29.889> 24<00:06:30.340> hours

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
appears once every 24 hours

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.189 
appears once every 24 hours
so<00:06:30.880> obviously<00:06:31.270> is<00:06:31.419> another<00:06:31.630> way<00:06:31.780> to<00:06:31.840> spend

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
so obviously is another way to spend

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.750 
so obviously is another way to spend
lots<00:06:32.440> of<00:06:32.560> money<00:06:32.620> if<00:06:33.039> you<00:06:33.160> want<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.580> and<00:06:33.699> you

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
lots of money if you want to and you

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.580 
lots of money if you want to and you
can't<00:06:33.970> be<00:06:34.090> asked<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.810> wait<00:06:34.960> for<00:06:35.110> it<00:06:35.169> to<00:06:35.289> appear

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
can't be asked to wait for it to appear

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.230
