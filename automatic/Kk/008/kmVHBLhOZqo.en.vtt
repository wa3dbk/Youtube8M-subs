with<00:00:35.720> idea<00:00:36.140> of<00:00:36.200> display<00:00:36.470> basically<00:00:36.920> which<00:00:37.399> is

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
with idea of display basically which is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.889 
with idea of display basically which is
fingerprint<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.270> stream<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.780> will

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
fingerprint in the stream so you will

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.720 
fingerprint in the stream so you will
not<00:00:39.050> if<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.620> have<00:00:39.770> any<00:00:39.920> kind<00:00:40.160> of<00:00:40.280> fingerprints

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
not if you have any kind of fingerprints

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.230 
not if you have any kind of fingerprints
but<00:00:41.390> if<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.890> correct<00:00:43.220> right<00:00:43.790> now<00:00:43.970> I<00:00:44.000> can

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
but if to the correct right now I can

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.330 
but if to the correct right now I can
see<00:00:44.480> something<00:00:44.900> happens<00:00:45.200> on<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.470> screen<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
see something happens on the screen the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.980 
see something happens on the screen the
screen<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.730> actually<00:00:46.880> quite<00:00:47.300> responsive<00:00:47.900> a

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
screen is actually quite responsive a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.310 
screen is actually quite responsive a
test<00:00:48.260> support<00:00:48.560> full<00:00:49.250> touch<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.840> think<00:00:51.080> it

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
test support full touch and I think it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.740 
test support full touch and I think it
should<00:00:51.560> support<00:00:52.280> minimum<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.880> 5<00:00:53.150> touch<00:00:53.450> point

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
should support minimum of 5 touch point

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.210 
should support minimum of 5 touch point
is<00:00:53.960> equally

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
is equally

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.180 
is equally
it<00:00:55.520> runs<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:55.910> Windows<00:00:56.270> 8<00:00:56.450> Pro<00:00:56.720> if<00:00:57.050> we<00:00:57.590> take<00:00:58.130> a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
it runs on Windows 8 Pro if we take a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.010 
it runs on Windows 8 Pro if we take a
look<00:00:58.460> at<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.850> form<00:00:59.090> factor<00:00:59.240> of<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.630> machine

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
look at the form factor of this machine

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200 
look at the form factor of this machine
this<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.800> how<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.010> machine<00:01:01.280> looks<00:01:01.700> like<00:01:01.790> on

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
this is how the machine looks like on

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.980
