00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello friends welcome once more to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 another tutorial or video tutorial of the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.910
 thing can access our website 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 or our website in the nacos network 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.789
 web.com where you can find 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.650
 articles related to this topic 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.449
 today we are going to learn to find the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 maximum common divisor the first will be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 have certain figures we have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.430
 the following figures 48 72 84 is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.920
 important that they know the numbers 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 cousins if they do not know the prime numbers 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.700
 can not find the most common 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 divider the first thing we should do is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829
 look for a prime number that divides the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.649
 any of these figures does not matter if 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.520
 it has stopped and parc with that it divides to a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.800
 we must choose the first prime number of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.650
 descending order we have the first 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 Many cousin number would say that it is 1 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.420
 but it's not like that because one would give the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.799
 same figures we have to choose the 2 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:22.680
 because 2 divides 48 and divides it into 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.680
 24 the 2 divides the 72 and does it in 36 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.050
 and 2 divides 84 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.050
 effectively divides it into 42 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.810
 well we search again we perform the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.690
 same procedure do not forget them 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.030
 mark that this number or this divided to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.510
 all figures when it divides all 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.340
 the numbers mark the number so that 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.280
 see at the end of this video how 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.710
 find the greatest common divisor the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.340
 next number should be 2 because the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 2 divides to 24 and does 12 to 2 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.899
 divide 36 effectively and they do 18 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.410
 the 2 divides the 42 effectively they do 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.120
 21 we mark this number again as 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.810
 that divided all the figures to the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 three figures and we start again with the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
 process 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.209
 we look for a number that divides any 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 to any number in remember in 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.330
 descending the prime number the 2 is the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.620
 first number of prime numbers 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.760
 then divide to 12 so that makes 6 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.180
 divide the 1819 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.660
 21 does not divide it so we go down 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 the 21st 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.910
 and this figure is not marked or this 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.000
 number we do not mark it because it did not divide 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.090
 all divided into two digits to 12 and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.670
 to 18 then we start again the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 procedure and the prime number that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.440
 divide to 6 is 2 do 3 and the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.860
 number 2 divides to 9 effectively what 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.390
 divide not divide it forgiveness the 2 is not 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.209
 issuer of 9 we went down 9 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:20.560
 and the 21 we go back down we have the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.380
 number 2 divides these none of life 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.100
 is 2 does not divide any of these but 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.580
 the 3 if you divide all these divide to 3 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.180
 divide it between 1 divide to 9 do 3 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.239
 because 3 times 3 equals 9 and divides the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.300
 21 effectively do 7 because 3 by 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.940
 7 equals 21 we mark this again 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.150
 number 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.020
 Now we are looking for a number that divides 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.360
 these two figures 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.130
 explode now take into account this already 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.480
 is discarded because up to now it has been 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:00.180
 finished his division and 3 does it with 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.160
 the 3 does 1 we go down the 7 and we go back to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.840
 eliminate is because you no longer have to 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.330
 take it into account and the 7 divided the 7 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.000
 because remember that 7 is number 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.640
 cousin and you can only live between 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.320
 your own unit then we have to 2 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.390
 x 2 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.220
 remember that we mark the numbers and 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.730
 those numbers that are marked are going 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.760
 to multiply 2 times 2 equals 4 and 4 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:32.160
 by 3 equals 12 then the maximum 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:39.690
 common divisor of all these numbers 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:43.020
 is number 12 in this way can 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.660
 find the greatest common divisor of 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.060
 all of any number given to them and 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.160
 as you can see it is a very procedure 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.590
 easy and simple to do in others 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.250
 videos we will see more about the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.410
 maximum common divisor by succession 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.410
 or by successive divisions
