ridiculously difficult to read the text
that<00:02:43.850> was<00:02:44.060> designed<00:02:44.480> here<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.960> second<00:02:45.290> is

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that was designed here one second is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.750 
that was designed here one second is
just<00:02:45.710> check<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.750> see<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.250> C

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.430 
just check it we see it's it's it's C
from<00:02:50.030> depending<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> angle<00:02:50.960> you<00:02:51.230> can

from depending on the angle you can

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.310 
from depending on the angle you can
barely<00:02:52.040> read<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.360> might<00:02:53.600> take<00:02:53.660> one<00:02:54.110> or

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
barely read it now it might take one or

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.220 
barely read it now it might take one or
two<00:02:54.350> hits<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:55.130> work<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:56.510> usually<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.080> works

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
two hits to work but usually it works

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.570 
two hits to work but usually it works

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
does not even fit properly when you try

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.979 
does not even fit properly when you try
and<00:04:04.580> fit<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.910> on<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.120> screen<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.900> very

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
and fit it on the screen it's very

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.530 
and fit it on the screen it's very
annoying<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:07.670> do<00:04:07.910> only<00:04:08.060> have<00:04:08.180> to

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
annoying and you do only have to

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.900 
annoying and you do only have to
downwards<00:04:09.140> upwards<00:04:09.799> but<00:04:10.129> that's<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.610> it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
downwards upwards but that's about it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.899 
downwards upwards but that's about it
so<00:04:11.480> now<00:04:11.660> let<00:04:12.379> me<00:04:12.409> show<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:13.040> magic<00:04:13.549> angle

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
so now let me show you the magic angle

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.490 
so now let me show you the magic angle
option<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.260> now<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.980> thought<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.500> Samsung

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
option so now I thought that the Samsung

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.140 
option so now I thought that the Samsung
would<00:04:18.620> have<00:04:18.829> corrected<00:04:19.370> their<00:04:19.549> problem<00:04:20.000> with

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
would have corrected their problem with

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.270 
would have corrected their problem with
their<00:04:20.299> monitor<00:04:20.840> monitors<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.650> screens<00:04:22.010> which

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
their monitor monitors and screens which

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.370 
their monitor monitors and screens which
is<00:04:22.430> bad<00:04:22.940> viewing<00:04:23.270> angle<00:04:23.690> when<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.199> side

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
is bad viewing angle when I go this side

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.140 
is bad viewing angle when I go this side
the<00:04:24.560> colors<00:04:24.830> are<00:04:24.979> screwed<00:04:25.310> when<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.820> go<00:04:25.970> this

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the colors are screwed when I go this

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150 
the colors are screwed when I go this
side<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.479> colors<00:04:26.750> are<00:04:26.930> screwed<00:04:27.169> again<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:28.010> now

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
side the colors are screwed again so now

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.740 
side the colors are screwed again so now
I<00:04:28.190> thought<00:04:28.760> they<00:04:28.940> would<00:04:29.090> have<00:04:29.120> corrected<00:04:29.330> it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
I thought they would have corrected it

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.420 
I thought they would have corrected it
look<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.199> but<00:04:30.650> what<00:04:30.800> they<00:04:30.949> did<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.370> they

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
look at that but what they did is they

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.260 
look at that but what they did is they
inserted<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.630> new<00:04:32.870> option<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.370> menu<00:04:34.729> which

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
inserted a new option in the menu which

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.409 
inserted a new option in the menu which
is<00:04:35.510> okay<00:04:36.080> that's<00:04:36.260> huh

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
sure you can't see it properly from the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.960 
sure you can't see it properly from the
side<00:04:40.010> let<00:04:40.430> me<00:04:40.520> shake<00:04:40.760> this<00:04:44.680> side<00:04:45.680> okay<00:04:46.310> let<00:04:46.850> me

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
yes let's take this angle okay this is

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.740 
yes let's take this angle okay this is
off<00:05:01.300> let's<00:05:02.300> try<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:02.630> on<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.000> on<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.600> see

off let's try it on this is on you see
the<00:05:05.870> difference<00:05:06.230> off<00:05:07.240> on<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:09.230> what's<00:05:10.130> the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
the difference off on now what's the

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.640 
the difference off on now what's the
difference<00:05:10.400> because<00:05:11.060> when<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.420> go<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:12.020> see<00:05:12.470> when

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
difference because when I go I see when

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.350 
difference because when I go I see when
I<00:05:12.680> have<00:05:12.860> hop<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.370> then<00:05:13.610> they<00:05:13.730> go<00:05:13.880> down<00:05:14.060> it

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
I have hop and then they go down it

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.930 
I have hop and then they go down it
screws<00:05:14.690> up<00:05:14.870> because<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.980> viewing<00:05:16.490> angle<00:05:16.850> on

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
screws up because the viewing angle on

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.430 
screws up because the viewing angle on
the<00:05:17.030> monitor<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.480> bad<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.290> when<00:05:18.920> I<00:05:18.950> use<00:05:19.250> my<00:05:20.440> my
