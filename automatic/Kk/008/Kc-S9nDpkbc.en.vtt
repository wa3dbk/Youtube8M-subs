00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
slope angle up ticket actually as

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.300 
slope angle up ticket actually as
supposed<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.500> yeah<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:07.040> then<00:04:07.190> it's

I don't know if is this took me over
three<00:04:50.939> days<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.539> build<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:54.080> your<00:04:55.080> app<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:56.000> really

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
three days to build so your app I really

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.700 
three days to build so your app I really
don't<00:04:57.150> want<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.330> take<00:04:57.449> apart<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.199> do<00:04:58.349> all<00:04:58.500> that
