00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
me of game of thrones of the character

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
me of game of thrones of the character
little<00:01:50.009> finger<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.939> yeah<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.360> issue<00:01:51.479> ends

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
little finger so yeah the issue ends

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
little finger so yeah the issue ends
with<00:01:52.170> Thanos<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.070> rest<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> Cabal

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
with Thanos and the rest of the Cabal

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.940 
with Thanos and the rest of the Cabal
exiting<00:01:54.180> their<00:01:54.299> life<00:01:54.540> raft<00:01:54.869> onto<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> battle

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
exiting their life raft onto the battle

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
exiting their life raft onto the battle
world<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.579> clear<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.149> his<00:01:57.329> own

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
world and it's clear that he has his own

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.319 
world and it's clear that he has his own
agenda<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.649> mind<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> guess<00:01:59.700> all<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.180> all

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
agenda in in mind so I guess all in all

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
agenda in in mind so I guess all in all
this<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> pretty<00:02:01.079> great<00:02:01.320> read<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
this was a pretty great read I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
this was a pretty great read I
especially<00:02:02.610> enjoyed<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.299> art<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.810> issue

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
especially enjoyed the art of this issue

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
especially enjoyed the art of this issue
i<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.890> by<00:02:05.100> ribbon<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.820> different

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
i think it was by ribbon a different

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.779 
i think it was by ribbon a different
artist<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> previous<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.220> possibly

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
artist from the previous one or possibly

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.550 
artist from the previous one or possibly
same<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.269> not<00:02:09.390> sure<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.229> felt<00:02:10.469> very

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
same one I'm not sure I just felt very

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.190 
same one I'm not sure I just felt very
just<00:02:11.250> good<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:11.939> just<00:02:12.060> great<00:02:12.510> quality<00:02:13.049> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
just good it was just great quality the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.259 
just good it was just great quality the
coloring<00:02:13.560> was<00:02:13.650> perfect<00:02:14.159> for<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.549> it'll<00:02:15.180> be

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
coloring was perfect for it it'll be

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.880 
coloring was perfect for it it'll be
interesting<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.719> see<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.989> guess<00:02:16.290> where<00:02:16.680> this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
interesting to see I guess where this

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.410 
interesting to see I guess where this
event<00:02:17.219> isn't<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.549> go<00:02:17.700> because<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.299> already

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
event isn't it go because we already

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
event isn't it go because we already
noticed<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.049> spoilers<00:02:19.469> thanks<00:02:19.769> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
noticed some of the spoilers thanks to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.709 
noticed some of the spoilers thanks to
bleeding<00:02:20.250> cool<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.939> unclear<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.540> how

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
bleeding cool but it's unclear is how

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.209 
bleeding cool but it's unclear is how
the<00:02:21.780> Titans<00:02:22.349> will<00:02:22.469> work<00:02:22.650> since<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.040> haven't

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
the Titans will work since we haven't

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.979 
the Titans will work since we haven't
really<00:02:23.310> got<00:02:23.579> any<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.939> them<00:02:24.060> yet<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.750> would

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
really got any of them yet so I would

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.539 
really got any of them yet so I would
recommend<00:02:25.019> checking<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.890> book<00:02:26.129> out<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.430> you
