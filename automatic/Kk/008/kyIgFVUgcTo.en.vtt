00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
know you can use a big flint in here but

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.409 
know you can use a big flint in here but
some<00:07:16.830> sort<00:07:17.100> of<00:07:17.220> I<00:07:17.430> don't<00:07:17.490> know<00:07:17.729> I<00:07:17.910> can't<00:07:18.210> think

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
some sort of I don't know I can't think

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:19.760 
some sort of I don't know I can't think
of<00:07:18.510> anything<00:07:18.720> that's<00:07:18.900> why<00:07:19.229> I'm<00:07:19.350> asking<00:07:19.500> you

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
of anything that's why I'm asking you

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.500 
of anything that's why I'm asking you
guys<00:07:19.949> um<00:07:21.470> different<00:07:22.470> different<00:07:23.310> fuels<00:07:23.639> you

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
guys um different different fuels you

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.700 
guys um different different fuels you
know<00:07:24.630> the<00:07:24.780> only<00:07:24.900> thing<00:07:24.990> I'm<00:07:25.199> not<00:07:25.229> going<00:07:25.650> to

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
know the only thing I'm not going to

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.879 
know the only thing I'm not going to
test<00:07:25.979> is<00:07:26.250> gasoline<00:07:26.669> because<00:07:27.380> seems<00:07:28.380> redundant

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
test is gasoline because seems redundant

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.659 
test is gasoline because seems redundant
it's<00:07:29.310> a<00:07:29.580> very<00:07:30.210> flammable<00:07:30.539> fuel<00:07:31.280> which<00:07:32.280> is<00:07:32.460> more

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
it's a very flammable fuel which is more

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.200 
it's a very flammable fuel which is more
flammable<00:07:32.970> than<00:07:34.130> lighter<00:07:35.130> fluid<00:07:35.430> so<00:07:35.880> and

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
flammable than lighter fluid so and

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.180 
flammable than lighter fluid so and
burns<00:07:36.930> very<00:07:37.199> quick<00:07:37.470> so<00:07:37.620> I'm<00:07:37.740> not<00:07:37.889> going<00:07:38.130> to

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.190 
burns very quick so I'm not going to

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.710 
burns very quick so I'm not going to
test<00:07:38.460> that<00:07:38.580> I<00:07:39.000> might<00:07:39.840> test<00:07:40.199> kerosene<00:07:40.770> and<00:07:41.720> I

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 
test that I might test kerosene and I

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.510 
test that I might test kerosene and I
might<00:07:42.930> test<00:07:43.260> diesel<00:07:43.830> fuel<00:07:44.070> because<00:07:44.370> those

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
might test diesel fuel because those

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.510 
might test diesel fuel because those
burns<00:07:44.760> a<00:07:45.030> lot<00:07:45.479> slower<00:07:46.070> but<00:07:47.070> those<00:07:47.250> will<00:07:47.400> be

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
burns a lot slower but those will be

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.500 
burns a lot slower but those will be
