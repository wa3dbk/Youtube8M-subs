00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
little bit opinionated but I think that

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.360 
little bit opinionated but I think that
almost<00:00:10.170> everyone<00:00:10.590> could<00:00:10.800> agree<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.190> there's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
beautiful either way unless your idea of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.620 
beautiful either way unless your idea of
beauty<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> war<00:00:16.740> zone<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.039> something

10 the nature altar this place just as

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930 
10 the nature altar this place just as
its<00:00:33.719> name<00:00:33.989> suggests<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.890> filled<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.610> quite<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
its name suggests is filled with quite a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.299 
its name suggests is filled with quite a
lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> nature<00:00:36.780> there's<00:00:37.290> even<00:00:37.530> birds<00:00:37.860> with

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
lot of nature there's even birds with

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.160 
lot of nature there's even birds with
their<00:00:38.489> nest<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.120> top<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.510> stone<00:00:39.750> henges

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
their nest on top of the stone henges

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
their nest on top of the stone henges
which<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.530> also<00:00:40.770> covered<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.399> vines<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.090> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
which are also covered in vines and this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
which are also covered in vines and this
place<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.140> all-around<00:00:43.520> beautiful<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
place is just all-around beautiful I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
place is just all-around beautiful I
also<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.870> even<00:00:46.320> though<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.559> place

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
also think that even though this place

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
also think that even though this place
is<00:00:47.010> obviously<00:00:47.460> covered<00:00:47.879> heavily<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
is obviously covered heavily with so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
is obviously covered heavily with so
much<00:00:48.660> foliage<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> nature<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
much foliage and nature all around it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
much foliage and nature all around it
doesn't<00:00:50.850> even<00:00:50.969> take<00:00:51.270> away<00:00:51.420> from<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> beauty

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
doesn't even take away from the beauty

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
doesn't even take away from the beauty
here<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> makes<00:00:53.160> sense<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.270> not

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
here if that makes sense at all it's not

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
here if that makes sense at all it's not
too<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.890> too<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.370> either

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
too much and it's not too little either

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
too much and it's not too little either
it's<00:00:57.120> almost<00:00:57.690> perfection<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:58.980> opinion

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's almost perfection in my opinion

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's almost perfection in my opinion
number<00:00:59.969> 9<00:01:00.230> backstory<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.410> Falls<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.000> much

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
number 9 backstory and Falls not so much

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
number 9 backstory and Falls not so much
just<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.600> waterfalls<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
just the waterfalls here but more so the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
just the waterfalls here but more so the
entire<00:01:05.610> area<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.630> sort<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> perfect

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
entire area is just sort of a perfect

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
entire area is just sort of a perfect
setting<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.340> you've<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.090> beautiful

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
setting I think you've got beautiful

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
setting I think you've got beautiful
waterfalls<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> such<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.250> time

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
waterfalls and such but at the same time

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
waterfalls and such but at the same time
there's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> house<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> top<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> waterfall

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
there's a house on top of the waterfall

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
there's a house on top of the waterfall
you<00:01:13.470> can't<00:01:13.920> tell<00:01:14.100> me<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> wouldn't<00:01:14.549> like

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you can't tell me that you wouldn't like

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.249 
you can't tell me that you wouldn't like
to<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.090> house<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> waterfall

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to have your house on top of a waterfall

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
to have your house on top of a waterfall
I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.189> living<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.670> next<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> giant

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I think living right next to a giant

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
I think living right next to a giant
waterfall<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.869> real<00:01:19.049> life<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.590> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
waterfall in real life would be so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499 
waterfall in real life would be so
peaceful<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.640> wake<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> morning

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
peaceful to wake up to in the morning

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
peaceful to wake up to in the morning
this<00:01:22.170> place<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> long<00:01:22.799> time<00:01:23.130> actually

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this place for a long time actually

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
this place for a long time actually
before<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> game<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.360> developed<00:01:24.720> into

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
before the game really developed into

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840

comes<00:05:10.570> down<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:11.020> my<00:05:11.110> opinion<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.590> suppose<00:05:12.010> but

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
comes down to my opinion I suppose but

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.310 
comes down to my opinion I suppose but
there's<00:05:12.760> absolutely<00:05:13.240> no<00:05:13.630> denying<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.110> this
