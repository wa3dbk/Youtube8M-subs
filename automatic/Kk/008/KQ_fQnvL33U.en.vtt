different<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.150> any<00:00:58.600> manager<00:00:58.989> we've<00:00:59.110> had

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
his company and I think that

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.649

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
this year and when you on that roll you

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.969 
this year and when you on that roll you
sort<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.660> confidence<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.319> there<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.739> you

just take it game by game I think it's a
fantastic<00:02:05.110> record<00:02:05.679> because<00:02:05.979> they<00:02:06.130> go<00:02:06.250> away

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
fantastic record because they go away

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.889 
fantastic record because they go away
from<00:02:06.520> home<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.849> normally<00:02:07.090> expect<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.629> try

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
from home you normally expect it to try

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.839 
from home you normally expect it to try
and<00:02:07.929> make<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.170> point<00:02:08.319> here<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.679> there<00:02:08.860> but

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
and make a point here and there but

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:10.949 
and make a point here and there but
we've<00:02:10.000> done<00:02:10.119> far<00:02:10.330> more<00:02:10.360> than<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.810> this

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
we've done far more than that this

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.270 
we've done far more than that this
season<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.860> actually<00:02:12.129> been<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
season and it's actually been the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.660
