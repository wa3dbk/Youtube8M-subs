00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.240
 Peru where usually here inside 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 of the country I have been able to meet more 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.960
 people to become friends with others 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.260
 people in other countries and in others 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260
 cities 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.540
 this sport allows us to develop 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.390
 our mental and physical abilities 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.080
 because almost join all parts of 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.330
 body and in the mind works 100% 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 we have a table like all 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 important sports not only of 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 pass the ball with the other because not 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780
 anyone can do it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.800
 now if we practice I will be the mind 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.090
 it's called toppings which consists of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:48.190
 who works causes it to turn around and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 Concentrate musical and make it third ball 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.010
 to take out 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.010
 and attack 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.420
 I have always said that is to persevere 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 reach if one plays too well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.100
 train can reach his glory 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.330
