 but the only way to get here 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.180
 hanging with the pussy thing is uncommon 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.500

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.869
 automatically you can quickly win 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.759
 which means that we have to do something about it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.799

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.659

 rest if I still completely walk and then 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.929
 there shouldn't be anyone in my back from what 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.929
 by policy 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.019
 I have you and I still continue to 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.940
 so there is still a treadmill somewhere 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.680
 someone kempen 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.800
 no but 100 percent sure it's still there 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.800
 someone at the kempis somewhere 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.590
 there is a must now finish those people 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.560
 flag in their hands not really one yet 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.440

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.820
 so so so so so 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
 now no more you have to come my back 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.730
 and must lie flat on the floor 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.520
 because I have to try to put them there 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.750
 because they act as a key and span 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.980
 on the one hand, I want to get back on it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.540
 when i'm going from fucking fucking 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.060
 fucking 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.600
 gradually co-co-co-co-co-co-co you 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.830
 I thought so 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.870
 I always thought that could be thank you 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.100
 teammate 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.900
 find that flag that runs after me 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.040
 man is angry with going through london anyway 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.990
 dead 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.220
 how do we expect it to size 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.770
 he is dead 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.290
 and he goes and he continues he survives 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.670
 just what the fuck what the fuck why 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.000
 nobody thought that big thank you from 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.000
 just say 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.670
 machines just ask you on someone 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.560
 that guy because the flag is just out 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.330
 everyone looks allowed to walk one already 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 problem is nobody loved him and can now 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.660
 usually my heart is you i am the dick 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.660
 I am lying next to the flag and I can not 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.030
 and i ca n't take that away monster voltage 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.410
 all of that name that was rotten with you 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.490

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.510
 holy shit man 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.140
 I go behind that flag exam that he 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.520
 is on my part 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.590
 You might be handy to him then 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.000
 to kill if you walk straight to him 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.040
 10 with those just beside me is also there 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.210
 a my teammate a nice kill points 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220
 above you over you at multimate 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.920
 and I'm not going to work and you are not 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.630
 working driving pleasure suit is a visa 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.630
 namely no pissing off with your action 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.590
 yes this was but I am good for it 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.710
 the mole or man but I'm really good 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.710
 to feel 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.670
 at times you just hobby 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.820

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.890
 all puppies the entire game and then he has to 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.160
 just a pigeon impact yo mark and there it is 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.980
 no puppy that you can handle 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.530
 but nothing you can survive there 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.060
 if your thumb makes a keel with a 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.350

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.440
 I recommend trying the stay nights 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.520
 nobody knew I was there 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.870
 well that one wheel is all that i there 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.460
 was because of course i give him a try 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.260
 but they didn't know me 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.420
 there came walking by me naturally 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.310
 not on the radar otherwise was young man 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.780
 it was really a shame 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.060
 I have a bow and six points again 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.670
 just go by the bus one is near the flag 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.990
 therefore boys nose and miss all come 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.580
 celebrate the other side all 4 this side 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.580
 I don't always become myself 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.420

 waiting for me know you know your own 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.210
 then I just go the other way 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.680
 shit on it 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.030
 so there ran that bowl on the other side 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.530
 there was also logic table on it 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.570
 all the way with that guy guy that kill the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.180

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.770
 that guy I'm going to beast again and look 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.700
 there is almost to the number of points 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.700
 on 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.140

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 no no no no no no no no shot 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.520
 I will survive that mission a bit 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.230
 he just simply had shot wrong 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.120
 I also talk about lame but no of course 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.630
 I like a strip set he has to you 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.100
 have thank you 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.560
 when I have to go to the comics nature 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.840
 amounts to 34 kills 5-holes 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.980
 but they have a good sign with this weapon and now 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.080
 do you have the flag on it with sabrina 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.160
 take the flag and drink just like me 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.680
 I am still dead again 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.930
 can get but I had soon gone 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.980
 I do not yet know how much station I am 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.060
 could not have made it anyway because 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.320
 still had to 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.320
 no I wasn't lucky anymore 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.290
 yo I saw black spots but I 'm going to pack 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.520
 the flags of this new click won 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.780
 I didn't feel like it anymore but I had one 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.430
 just pick up the flag I think 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.480
 it was good because i was on the mold 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.400
 not get more 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.350
 630 to five nicely played team 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.000
 and acts against hard also 30 to 10 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.770
 so therefore no it you have to 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.240
 faster and a thieme called 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.710
 it fixed the flag so there still in it 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.060
 booklet even faster like 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.410
 of course a pity if that happens in the 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.180
 team sweet and a game but still one 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.530
 link boxmeer 6695 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.970

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.680
 a nice bow then went crazy ultra 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.740
 small 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.910
 sit has a case comes down and a pity 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.850
 man too bad he shooter the arms it 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.500
 is what people can say to the 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.500
 next time bye bye bye
