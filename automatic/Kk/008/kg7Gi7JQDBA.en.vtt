attention and this one kept my attention
so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.520> thought<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.000> was<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> good<00:04:40.810> sign

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080

certainly<00:04:41.950> that's<00:04:42.100> not<00:04:42.460> what<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.729> critics

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
certainly that's not what the critics

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.719 
certainly that's not what the critics
thought<00:04:43.419> well<00:04:44.139> it's<00:04:44.320> suitably<00:04:44.710> creepy<00:04:45.310> well

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
thought well it's suitably creepy well
