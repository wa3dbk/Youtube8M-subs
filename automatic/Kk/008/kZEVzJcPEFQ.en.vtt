8 beta 2 and beta 1 we suspected that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
8 beta 2 and beta 1 we suspected that
the<00:00:53.039> date<00:00:53.340> trick<00:00:54.110> would<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:56.149> removed<00:00:57.289> now<00:00:58.289> in

no<00:01:02.670> longer<00:01:03.000> works<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.600> iOS<00:01:04.049> 8.1<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.180> are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
no longer works in iOS 8.1 so if you are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
no longer works in iOS 8.1 so if you are
an<00:01:06.689> emulator<00:01:07.350> fan<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.430> definitely<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.570> not

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
an emulator fan you definitely do not

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.490 
an emulator fan you definitely do not
want<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> update<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:12.030> iOS<00:01:12.659> 8.1<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:15.500> probably

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
want to update to iOS 8.1 and probably

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.700 
want to update to iOS 8.1 and probably
going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:18.090> reason<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.710> several

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
going to be a good reason for several

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820 
going to be a good reason for several
users<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.580> jailbreak<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.290> brings<00:01:22.560> us<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
users to jailbreak and that brings us to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.880 
users to jailbreak and that brings us to
the<00:01:23.159> next<00:01:23.189> question<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.619> think

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the next question now if you will think

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.539 
the next question now if you will think
back<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.909> pangu<00:01:27.420> jailbreak<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
back in the pangu jailbreak one of the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.810 
back in the pangu jailbreak one of the
things<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.060> had<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:31.430> set<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.640> date

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
things you had to do was set your date

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.440 
things you had to do was set your date
back<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> how<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.460> affect

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.710 

jailbreaking<00:01:40.729> gasps<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.659> think

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
jailbreaking gasps I really don't think

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
jailbreaking gasps I really don't think
Apple

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
Apple

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.810 
Apple
just<00:01:46.390> notice<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.290> roms<00:01:47.620> and<00:01:48.100> all<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.460> thing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
just notice the roms and all that thing

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.170 
just notice the roms and all that thing
people<00:01:49.330> were<00:01:49.450> using<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.230> think<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> date<00:01:51.670> trick

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
people were using I think the date trick

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.980 
people were using I think the date trick
was<00:01:53.050> used<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.890> Iowa<00:01:54.250> 7.jpg<00:01:55.240> no<00:01:55.450> jailbreak

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
was used in the Iowa 7.jpg no jailbreak

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.590 
was used in the Iowa 7.jpg no jailbreak
and<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.950> personally<00:01:57.580> believe<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
and I personally believe that is the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.040 
and I personally believe that is the
reason<00:01:58.870> why<00:01:59.380> they<00:02:00.310> targeted<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:02.520> actual<00:02:04.050> way

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
reason why they targeted that actual way

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.960 
reason why they targeted that actual way
of<00:02:05.470> getting<00:02:06.310> iOS<00:02:06.910> apps<00:02:07.780> on<00:02:08.320> your<00:02:08.380> device<00:02:08.970> they

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
of getting iOS apps on your device they

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.850 
of getting iOS apps on your device they
thought<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.270> could<00:02:10.510> prevent<00:02:11.050> maybe<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
thought they could prevent maybe the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
thought they could prevent maybe the
hours<00:02:12.430> 8<00:02:12.850> jailbreak<00:02:13.750> or<00:02:14.020> at<00:02:14.110> least<00:02:14.350> prolong<00:02:14.860> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
hours 8 jailbreak or at least prolong it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.270 
hours 8 jailbreak or at least prolong it
maybe<00:02:16.270> they<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.170> know<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.590> may<00:02:17.920> throw

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
maybe they have you know this may throw

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.090 
maybe they have you know this may throw
a<00:02:18.310> monkey<00:02:18.610> wrench<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.270> everything<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:20.140> mean<00:02:20.380> who

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
a monkey wrench in everything I mean who

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.040 
a monkey wrench in everything I mean who
knows<00:02:21.340> Pangu<00:02:22.000> could<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:22.450> been<00:02:22.630> ready<00:02:22.930> to
