 back to the leaders of the week's hans in the mast to this for the first time 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.790

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.410
 8 Alkmaar 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.840
 then the pit stop of the leader in the smallest posts because I think we are here 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.579
 from and then on a restart 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.959
 we do not ask them what exactly happened 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.089
 that while the name 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 but not true that we have before he job 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 although that could not be concluded with a name no longer have a job 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.519
 the temperature is clear report and vvd voters 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.129
 it's getting busier in the pit lane saying it said he was smiling 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.180
 the best option for speed but when driving away is an error three quarters of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.129
 the trading day 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 the public prosecutor of dendermonde who is lost 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.500
 it is therefore not out of sight 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.769
 he reported himself a second in the match at that time 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.649
 get to work the car is jacked up 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.749
 and the tire is replaced and there is also on the other side of the car 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:56.899
 drawn naturally 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.899
 time to go and see how the other participants are doing this is by the way 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.969
 anp china currently has five in the large tent that fits in with the kyoto 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:04.949
 supra 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.569
 their names would have to stop the game three minutes later 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:14.169
 Now it was until 2006 7 this is the best of being on a franc tree 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.909
 advanced to a second position 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.649
 still second job but loses his second place to work 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.569
 the house is also with problems in the pits mgr 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.599
 but the conditions 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.479
 continue to do so 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.199
 but there comes that second quarter 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.269
 a bridge too far for the troops 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.879
 that is a little more optimistic yet no one before it turned out that nothing can be made anymore 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.030
 ondank toppled suddenly suddenly first through the bend where is the leader 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.170
 in the race that is on its way to its pit stop 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.839
 last he reports 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.290
 everyone has already changed 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.290
 and then it's the turn of a wk ticket 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.909
 Yes fine 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.489
 the year before 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.450
 it has become very hot in the car of the cup more than 80 degrees it is there 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.050
 the both this now is a 28 year old apeldoorner at the temperature that the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.109
 engine and gearbox 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.949
 the last part of the Amsterdam game in the lead in the 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.239
 want to stay downtown and then the opinion is that the three are flat 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.130
 at the back 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.780
 third place dropped Hans van der Beek fourth place between a woman 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.859
 you sat here with the guard closer to a sixth position 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.690
 in the class of thirteen under to 2006 it is over 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.049
 Through Paul Van Splitting who is in charge India does not have that 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.600
 relinquish more to the smallest class lead ball disappeared when buckthorn 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.090
 try something that we see here in a second position than the finish of 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.190
 Fred hits after 47 London Prince defeat of Twente second place 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.290
 The money rooftops of him are totally in favor of Hans Vandeweghe 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.129
 afterwards we visited the stream and discovered it 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.229
 was very tired if it doesn't look good 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.529
 bring it on 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.299
