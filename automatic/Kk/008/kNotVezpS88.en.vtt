00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.200
 teaching how to make ink oil 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.940
 squid 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.520
 to make a squid ink oil 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.830
 it's very simple we have olive oil 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.380
 extra virgin of the arbequina variety 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 and squid ink we are going to deposit 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 this ink 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.690
 in the bottle where then we're going to put 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 Oil 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.180
 and now let's see just having the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.329
 oil this oil has some 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.100
 very large applications 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.480
 to flavor fish dishes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.480
 for fish grill 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 and you will see that the appearance that has 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.980
 It is very spectacular because at the same time 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.980
 we are going to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.710
 apply it we will also be giving a 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.710
 chromatic touch different from the plate 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.100
 let's cover a little 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.009
 and shake 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.980
 as they have different densities there 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.980
 just never homogenize 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.080
 and then on the plate, it looks like a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.600
 sort of cut vinaigrette 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.939
 ah 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.230
 but the camera has already had totally the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.120
 oil 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.680
 and the use as I say is 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.210
 very spectacular and offers some 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.930
 very good results on the plate 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.100
 always before applying it to shake it already 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.570
 we would have it however I am going to 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.720
 present on a plate so you can 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 watch 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.440
 how is it 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.740
 you see 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.780
 with ink in suspension and it's perfect 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.850
 as i tell you 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.450
 when accompanying fish dishes 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.020
 and this is a very simple way of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.830
 make an ink oil 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.830
 look
