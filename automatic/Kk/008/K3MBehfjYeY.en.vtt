00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:21.689
 the dhb did not ask me 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 that was my my our idea it is 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.400
 yes so the German handball federation 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.000
 just offspring ranking worldwide number 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.400
 One is and we are great educated 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 youth players have but very very 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.949
 late the connection to the international 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 Achieve lace and that was so 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.830
 starting point here is a promotion 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.970
 So hang gifted 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.450
 to promote players in the dual system too 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.670
 support and we have one 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.649
 concept hungry and that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.070
 Fortunately, it was the same 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.870
 has been 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.259
 and there you have to force it all over 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.509
 introduced the position of the mentor and 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.430
 I was assigned this mentor 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.430
 perform activities 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 So the time 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 meeting of elite promotion or the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.050
 Goals that we pursue are on the one hand 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 our players are still much better at 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.990
 to train individual area around them 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 quickly to this international peak 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.870
 introduce 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.780
 this ultimately affects all areas 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.610
 athletic then the handball specific 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 skills and crafts and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.830
 of course, too 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 personality development and it was yes 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.119
 often this dual career one earlier 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.580
 brake for the development and this 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.280
 Both areas make sense to each other 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.720
 interlock is one of our most important 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.850
 goals and there I think we have completely 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.690
 Good ideas that we are the players 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.630
 We will advise you 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.100
 what options do you have in 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 school and study or 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.280
 training and there they should 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.890
 then implement it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.890
 these international developments 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 also require certain measures such as 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.370
 for individual workout the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.010
 behind in comparison to other nations 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.730
 in Germany in the back and after 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.790
 Since we want last year from dhb page 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.010
 Support give hints like that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.989
 players are to develop and in 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 the cooperation with very many 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.459
 train and that's the enjoyable 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.640
 that many Bundesliga first and 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.830
 Second league attached to these thoughts 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.350
 have and in this individual 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.280
 Also give him a lot of attention with the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.280
 work for players 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.130
 It is a lot of time in the car 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.210
 but you can also do many 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.240
 to worry about 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.550
 It's such that in the week two to 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.790
 to do three days for me, I have before 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.459
 place to the venues or to the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.310
 coordinate training locations of the players 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.709
 there the different areas we 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.410
 even have two levels of cooperation 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.420
 the one level is the sporty where 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.470
 All participating coaches with on site 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.540
 Sports psychologists are needed and the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.000
 second level the school vocational 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.760
 where parents are with us then 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.090
 teachers teach the schools respectively 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.330
 and in the unis the mentors this for 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 these areas exist 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.810
 We balance our activities 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.400
 also a certain training control 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.580
 load control we manufacture 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.160
 have built a system now 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.769
 internet platform where the players are theirs 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.989
 document training content and 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.750
 pass on and know the dhb trainers 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.340
 then exactly how the player charged 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.720
 have been and can be accordingly in 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.850
 The courses react in exactly the same way 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.300
 document the dhb coach their 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.390
 measures at dhb courses and so on 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.150
 have a very close communication 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.860
 found the one more activity of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.430
 mentors is also the player of course 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.940
 to accompany with dab measures and in 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.160
 agreement with the dfb trainers jews 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.599
 junior or youth coach 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.610
 now so individual areas 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.780
 we also give in very intensively 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.780
 training days this 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.549
 yes a very important criterion 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:10.659
 Of course the development of 

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:12.949
 personality because we all know 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.439
 Handballers need good handballers too 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.909
 to be types and you ultimately live 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.199
 also have a good grip 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:24.259
 Good time management too 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:29.029
 the role model effect they have to consciously 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.219
 be and we want to do with all 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.509
 support 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.689
 it is important for us we always give 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:39.699
 advice and assistance 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:42.699
 this request 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.499
 to have self-confidence then 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.839
 Above all, we lay self-discipline 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.369
 great value as we the players 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.999
 Always say that is an offer now 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:55.519
 perform and perceive of us and 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:57.559
 it would have to decide that for itself 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:59.959
 very important criterion that one 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.299
 which shows independence and 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:04.449
 for themselves as well as for others 

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:07.449
 responsibility for your own actions 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.449
 takes over 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.229
 So basically I want to say that 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.220
 the cooperation with the unite very much 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.479
 good is 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.099
 where there was a lot of catching up to do and it was 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.620
 my main job was this 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.840
 to create awareness as important 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.880
 individual training is that one 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.430
 really creates free space and with 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.210
 These players very specifically 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.819
 work out 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.099
 that was usually understood that way 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.229
 that groups tactical elements with the 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.960
 complete team were trained 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.550
 and there is no difference 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.669
 There were differences in the burden of 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.699
 addressing in the methods between the 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:54.150
 very young players and the 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:55.979
 savvy professionals but and that 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.130
 meanwhile, if not yet 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.590
 everywhere as desired it really 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.289
 at least twice a week in the 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.389
 week free times where handball 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.210
 specific deficits worked up 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:11.460
 what works well and 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.530
 had worked too 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.419
 athletic training that that 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.690
 individually trained but is currently 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:21.150
 these handball specific elements that 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.360
 was still on very earthy feet and 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.360
 That's where we have to go on intensively 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.360
 use
