were moving you were moving the eyeballs
individually<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:25.760> those<00:02:25.970> stars<00:02:26.360> yeah<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
individually on those stars yeah I

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.259 
individually on those stars yeah I
realize<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.250> might<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:29.150> nice<00:02:29.680> okay

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
realize that might be a a nice okay

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.070 
realize that might be a a nice okay
demonstration<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.390> how<00:02:32.510> much<00:02:32.660> control<00:02:33.050> you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
demonstration of how much control you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.199 
demonstration of how much control you
have<00:02:33.200> over<00:02:33.379> there<00:02:33.800> right<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.190> see<00:02:34.819> if<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.120> get

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
have over there right I see if I can get

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.550 
have over there right I see if I can get
close<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:35.629> after<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.900> smell<00:02:36.319> close

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
close to me after that smell close

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.670 
close to me after that smell close
actually

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
actually

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
actually
that's<00:02:39.680> gonna<00:02:39.860> be<00:02:40.010> cool

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that's gonna be cool

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:59.920 
that's gonna be cool
I<00:02:40.730> was<00:02:41.239> being<00:02:41.450> slowed<00:02:41.569> down<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:59.360> change

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
I was being slowed down I can change

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.580 
I was being slowed down I can change
things

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.009 

yeah<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:07.340> we've<00:03:07.700> done<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.030> head<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
yeah so so we we've done the head the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.220 
yeah so so we we've done the head the
top<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.410> head<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:10.370> it's<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.849> more<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.329> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
top of the head it's it's in more as the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.990 
top of the head it's it's in more as the
points<00:03:12.500> are<00:03:12.590> now<00:03:12.680> sticking<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.459> jittering

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
points are now sticking not jittering

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.289 
points are now sticking not jittering
all<00:03:14.180> over<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.420> place<00:03:14.599> tomorrow<00:03:14.840> man<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:20.150> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
all over the place tomorrow man so that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.380 
all over the place tomorrow man so that
first<00:03:20.569> breath<00:03:21.230> maybe<00:03:21.530> pull<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.360> a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
first breath maybe pull the the a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.539 
first breath maybe pull the the a
further<00:03:24.079> back<00:03:24.349> so<00:03:24.379> that<00:03:24.799> she<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.100> has<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> bit

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
further back so that she just has a bit

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:37.330 
further back so that she just has a bit
more<00:03:25.579> movement<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.329> that<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:36.799> also<00:03:37.010> gone<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
more movement on that so it also gone a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.670 
more movement on that so it also gone a
little<00:03:37.459> bit<00:03:37.700> looser<00:03:37.910> on<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.510> material<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.200> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
little bit looser on the material on the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.620 
little bit looser on the material on the
top<00:03:39.859> so<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.160> follows

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
top so that follows

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.520 
top so that follows
okay<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.690> first<00:03:47.020> time<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.290> that's

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
okay is that the first time that that's

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.650 
okay is that the first time that that's
happened<00:03:48.000> that's<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.270> it's<00:03:49.390> supposed<00:03:49.600> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660
