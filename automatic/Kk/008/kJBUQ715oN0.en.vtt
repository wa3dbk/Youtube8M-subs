00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.230
 we are in milan and ktm salon 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:25.449
 expand his family duke for 2013 with 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.980
 the 390 model then there 390 duke respects 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.930
 the philosophy of the ktm brand of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.369
 light sport bikes that use 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.590
 often single-cylinder is the case 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.730
 here but he is not inherited from others 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.520
 models of the range it's a whole 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.090
 new engine 373.2 cubic centimeters 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.719
 and a power of 40 4 horses on the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 390 duke we find an abs that's 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.110
 pretty good for security 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.780
 on the other hand the brake caliper does not come 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.260
 not at brembo cdu bibrÃ© 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.350
 finally suspensions are entrusted awp 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.460
 a technical partner loyal to ktm and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.379
 who often showed a beautiful 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.030
 efficiency 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.440
 so obviously we do not know 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.850
 again if it's a definitive version 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.690
 the bike presented on this show 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.550
 nevertheless there are still a lot of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.090
 connectivity present and a little bad to 2 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.680
 on 7,390 duke at ktm we are used to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.690
 to make compact bikes and well that's 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.670
 check again we feel a 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.720
 roughly as in 125 aboard 7 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 390 duke 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.770
 it is given for 139 kg dry is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.140
 really not much for a motorcycle of 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.550
 road with all the road fittings 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.550
 and then that's the state or 800 mm of 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.619
 height of the ground so it remains a motorcycle 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.259
 which will probably be easy enough to access 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.640
 for small templates 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.200
 this is the new 390 duke it's 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.929
 definitely the most strategic bike 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.610
 for ktm for 2013 why because 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.590
 that it will be homologated in versions to 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.070
 two so young people will be able to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.960
 access this bike 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 it will nevertheless be slightly slanted 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.840
 because she is she a weight ratio 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880
 power that is a little too favorable 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.110
 she is a bit too light nevertheless is going 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.940
 to reach a wide audience 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.340
 new licenses those who come back 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.890
 to make the bike the feminine because 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.650
 that it is compact it's a bike like 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.930
 the sweet 125 and 200 that will be assembled in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.280
 india then checked at ktm in austria 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.530
 before being distributed on the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.520
 different markets and it will be proposed 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.330
 at the price of 5000 90 euros aware of 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330
 summer 2013 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.370
 it
