 me 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.859

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 Why frozen pumpkin is delicious 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.350
 Do you know if it is about to eat pumpkin 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.100
 Vegetables are not freshly prepared 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.340
 That's a little different 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.440
 Pumpkin is put for a while after harvest 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.530
 The most mature scene is the scene 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.760
 I didn't know what it was 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.900

 Let's take a closer look at the delicious secret of frozen pumpkin 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.860
 As the pumpkin grows, the number of yen increases 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:24.550
 It will decrease after the peak 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:27.960
 However, if it is harvested at the peak time and it keeps it, starch will be converted to sugar 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:35.250
 That gives the pumpkin a good deal 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:38.840
 Pumpkins and other frozen vegetables are the first to be frozen by rapidly freezing their delicious seasonal sensation. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:46.460

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.909

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.800
