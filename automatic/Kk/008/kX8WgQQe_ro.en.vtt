00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
does not get very hot at all at all I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.860 
does not get very hot at all at all I
mean<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:51.150> lay<00:02:51.270> my<00:02:51.420> hand<00:02:51.570> here<00:02:51.690> all

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
mean I can I can lay my hand here all

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.180 
mean I can I can lay my hand here all
day<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.260> nice<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.680> warm

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
day it's nice and warm

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.730 
day it's nice and warm
rather<00:02:53.700> than<00:02:53.970> heating<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.870> lot<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.290> warm

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
rather than heating up a lot it's warm

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.120 
rather than heating up a lot it's warm
so<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> mean<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.450> constant<00:02:58.110> heat<00:02:58.320> one<00:02:58.530> day

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
so I mean that's constant heat one day

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.880 
so I mean that's constant heat one day
anything<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> he<00:03:01.080> gets<00:03:01.260> his<00:03:01.320> heat<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
anything so he gets his heat from that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.550 
anything so he gets his heat from that
also<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> end<00:03:03.270> his<00:03:03.450> UVB<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.200> he's<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
also in the end his UVB so he's got to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.590 
also in the end his UVB so he's got to
do<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.340> tropical<00:03:06.239> UV<00:03:06.720> beasts<00:03:07.080> 5.0<00:03:08.600> we

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
shake it around a bit until the right

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
amount comes out and I have put a little

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.660 
amount comes out and I have put a little
too<00:04:51.660> much<00:04:51.780> in<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.140> elastic<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:53.250> he's<00:04:53.400> okay

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
too much in the elastic but he's okay

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.370 
too much in the elastic but he's okay
because<00:04:53.820> he<00:04:54.000> eats<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.420> briefest<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:57.510> that's

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
because he eats the briefest and that's

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.200 
because he eats the briefest and that's
the<00:04:58.590> tank<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.570> the<00:05:00.570> temperatures<00:05:01.050> should<00:05:01.650> be

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
the tank and the temperatures should be

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.960 
the tank and the temperatures should be
roughly<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:05.150> I'd<00:05:06.150> say<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.340> 90<00:05:08.340> or<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.700> in<00:05:08.910> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
roughly like I'd say a 90 or so in the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.660 
roughly like I'd say a 90 or so in the
basket<00:05:09.420> if<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:09.690> shouldn't<00:05:09.960> like<00:05:10.400> like<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
basket if it shouldn't like like the the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.730 
basket if it shouldn't like like the the
basking<00:05:14.670> spot<00:05:14.700> should<00:05:15.030> be<00:05:15.120> 85<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.810> 90<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.410> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
basking spot should be 85 to 90 and the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.360 
basking spot should be 85 to 90 and the
cool<00:05:16.980> area<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.370> 75<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.060> 85<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.110> over<00:05:19.980> here<00:05:20.250> is

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
cool area of 75 to 85 so over here is

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.580 
cool area of 75 to 85 so over here is
more<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.730> cool<00:05:20.970> area<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:22.230> it<00:05:22.320> doesn't<00:05:22.500> have

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
more of a cool area and it doesn't have

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.990 
more of a cool area and it doesn't have
too<00:05:22.710> much<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.920> a<00:05:23.070> cool<00:05:23.250> area<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.790> said

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
too much of a cool area like I said

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.670 
too much of a cool area like I said
because<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.300> got<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.570> heating<00:05:24.900> pad<00:05:25.080> but<00:05:25.590> he

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
because you got this heating pad but he

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.110 
because you got this heating pad but he
still<00:05:25.860> does<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.340> over<00:05:26.520> here<00:05:26.670> in<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.820> UVB

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
still does it's over here in the UVB

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.030 
still does it's over here in the UVB
spot<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.840> then<00:05:28.020> over<00:05:28.230> here<00:05:28.260> in<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.560> heat<00:05:28.830> I

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
spot and then over here in the heat I

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.770 
spot and then over here in the heat I
got<00:05:29.730> his<00:05:29.820> hide<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.210> heat<00:05:30.420> because<00:05:30.660> he

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
got his hide in the heat because he

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.750 
got his hide in the heat because he
likes<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.200> hide<00:05:31.650> under<00:05:32.220> there<00:05:32.370> because<00:05:32.580> it

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
likes to hide under there because it

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.780 
likes to hide under there because it
gets<00:05:33.030> warm<00:05:33.500> because<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.740> noticed<00:05:35.220> even<00:05:35.370> he<00:05:35.640> was

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
gets warm because I noticed even he was

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.400 
gets warm because I noticed even he was
trying<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.000> bury<00:05:36.210> holes<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.810> warms<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.230> get

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
trying to bury holes in the warms to get

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.620 
trying to bury holes in the warms to get
closer<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.920> heating<00:05:38.190> pad<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:38.700> made<00:05:39.390> him<00:05:39.570> a

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
closer to the heating pad so made him a
