well if you like homemade stuff I

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.730 
well if you like homemade stuff I

thought I'd show you these socks that my

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.049 
thought I'd show you these socks that my
axes<00:00:09.200> let<00:00:10.200> me<00:00:10.290> see<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.920> she<00:00:11.190> she's<00:00:11.610> my

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
axes let me see what is she she's my

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.580 
axes let me see what is she she's my
axes<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:14.150> she<00:00:15.150> made<00:00:15.360> these<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:16.020> me

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
axes on she made these for me

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.570 
axes on she made these for me
quite<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> long<00:00:17.070> time<00:00:17.400> ago<00:00:17.730> now<00:00:19.460> she<00:00:20.460> actually

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
quite a long time ago now she actually

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.359 
quite a long time ago now she actually
made<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.960> three<00:00:22.560> pairs<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.470> can't

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
made I think three pairs and I I can't

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.519 
made I think three pairs and I I can't
find<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> other<00:00:27.029> pair<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:27.810> reason<00:00:28.320> but

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
find the other pair for some reason but

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.240 
find the other pair for some reason but
they're<00:00:29.400> pretty<00:00:29.580> similar<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:31.250> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
they're pretty similar to these and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.750 
they're pretty similar to these and
they're<00:00:33.000> comfortable<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.559> fit<00:00:34.860> pretty

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they're comfortable and they fit pretty

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.630 
they're comfortable and they fit pretty
much<00:00:36.059> perfect<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:39.870> wear<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:40.800> every

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
much perfect and I wear these every

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.619 
much perfect and I wear these every
winter<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.550> if<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.730> were<00:00:44.969> regular<00:00:45.570> socks

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
winter and if these were regular socks

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
winter and if these were regular socks
they'd<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> garbage<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.420> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they'd be in the garbage by now but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
they'd be in the garbage by now but
these<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:52.820> really<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.030> quality<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.760> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
these are really good quality and I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.060 
these are really good quality and I
don't<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> tell<00:00:57.750> but<00:01:00.829> see<00:01:01.829> how

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
don't know if you can tell but see how

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
don't know if you can tell but see how
the<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.710> yarn<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.430> quite<00:01:07.909> what<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> call<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the the yarn is quite what you call it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.820 
the the yarn is quite what you call it
loose<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.920> guess<00:01:12.619> well<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.000> where<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
loose I guess well down here where you I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.170 
loose I guess well down here where you I
guess<00:01:16.830> where<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.310> snap<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.909> tiny

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guess where you snap it's a little tiny

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.770 
guess where you snap it's a little tiny
bit<00:01:21.600> war<00:01:22.520> because<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
bit war because you know get the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.219 
bit war because you know get the
pressure<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.560> foot<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:27.229> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
pressure from your foot on that but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.789 
pressure from your foot on that but
otherwise<00:01:28.500> they're<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:30.630> pretty<00:01:31.470> much<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
otherwise they're in pretty much the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.749 
otherwise they're in pretty much the
condition<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.729> were<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.070> day<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.549> she

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
condition they were the day that she

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.130 
condition they were the day that she
gave<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> me<00:01:38.119> especially<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.329> ones<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
gave these to me especially these ones I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
gave these to me especially these ones I
mean<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> same<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.030> stamped<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
mean the same thing it stamped down a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
mean the same thing it stamped down a
bit<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:47.130> pressure<00:01:47.399> from

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
bit because of the the pressure from

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.130 
bit because of the the pressure from
your<00:01:47.970> foot<00:01:49.009> but<00:01:50.009> anyway<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.790> were

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
your foot but anyway if these were

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.139 
your foot but anyway if these were
store-bought<00:01:52.140> socks

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
store-bought socks

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.350 
store-bought socks
they'd<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.360> big<00:01:54.600> holes<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:56.360> they'd

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they'd have big holes and on them they'd

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.249 
they'd have big holes and on them they'd
be<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.740> amass<00:01:58.770> I<00:02:01.130> don't<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:03.840> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
be a amass I don't think I did that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
be a amass I don't think I did that
there's<00:02:04.590> any<00:02:04.829> store-bought<00:02:05.729> sock<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.450> could

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.830 

tamp<00:02:37.350> down<00:02:37.530> because<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> pressure<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
tamp down because of the pressure of the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.910 
tamp down because of the pressure of the
foot<00:02:41.690> they're<00:02:42.690> pretty<00:02:43.200> much<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.470> men<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:45.920> wish

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
foot they're pretty much like men I wish

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.560 
foot they're pretty much like men I wish
I<00:02:47.070> could<00:02:47.250> find<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.610> other<00:02:47.820> persons<00:02:48.450> are

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I could find the other persons are

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
I could find the other persons are
similar<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.230> these<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:52.310> different<00:02:53.310> pad<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
similar to these but a different pad and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.660 
similar to these but a different pad and
I<00:02:54.180> think<00:02:55.110> she<00:02:55.290> did<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> damn<00:02:55.800> good<00:02:55.830> job<00:02:56.130> they

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I think she did a damn good job they

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.850 
I think she did a damn good job they
look<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:58.530> look<00:02:59.000> store-bought<00:03:00.000> really<00:03:00.860> but

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
look they look store-bought really but

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:11.080 
look they look store-bought really but
they're<00:03:02.070> not<00:03:02.340> they're<00:03:02.520> homemade

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.150 

you
