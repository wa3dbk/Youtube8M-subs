00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.960 

the<00:00:01.620> first<00:00:01.890> thing<00:00:02.129> you<00:00:02.250> could<00:00:02.399> do<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.820> can

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
the first thing you could do is you can

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.249 
the first thing you could do is you can
take<00:00:03.149> any<00:00:03.480> kind<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.290> hand<00:00:04.560> towel<00:00:04.830> or<00:00:05.190> dish<00:00:05.850> rag

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
take any kind of hand towel or dish rag

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.919 
take any kind of hand towel or dish rag
roll<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.440> up<00:00:07.910> your<00:00:08.910> nice<00:00:09.030> big<00:00:09.240> tube<00:00:09.950> stick<00:00:10.950> that

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
roll it up your nice big tube stick that

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.369 
roll it up your nice big tube stick that
in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> back<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.530> your<00:00:13.679> knee<00:00:13.830> joint<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:15.379> then

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in the back of your knee joint and then

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.570 
in the back of your knee joint and then
you're<00:00:16.500> basically<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> try<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.369> work

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
you're basically going to try and work

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.599 
you're basically going to try and work
into<00:00:18.330> full<00:00:18.630> knee<00:00:19.020> flexion<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> joint

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
into full knee flexion with that joint

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.630 
into full knee flexion with that joint
so<00:00:21.439> right<00:00:22.439> now<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.890> doesn't<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> whole<00:00:23.519> lot

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so right now this doesn't do a whole lot

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580 
so right now this doesn't do a whole lot
for<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.840> hit<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.109> end<00:00:25.320> range

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
for me because I can hit this end range

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
for me because I can hit this end range
motion<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.039> flexion<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> work<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.420> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
motion of flexion so you can work on it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
motion of flexion so you can work on it
a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.810> better<00:00:27.960> by<00:00:28.740> sitting<00:00:29.130> down<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.310> your

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
a little better by sitting down on your

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
a little better by sitting down on your
tibias<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> flexing<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.750> knee<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.800> right

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
tibias and flexing your knee so right

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
tibias and flexing your knee so right
here<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.770> referred

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
here you know that this can be referred

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
here you know that this can be referred
to<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.370> flexing<00:00:35.820> gapping<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.780> trying<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to as flexing gapping it's trying to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
to as flexing gapping it's trying to
like<00:00:37.200> gap<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> flexion<00:00:38.280> type<00:00:38.489> movement<00:00:38.879> but

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
like gap the flexion type movement but

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
like gap the flexion type movement but
what's<00:00:39.420> more<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.840> occurring<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
what's more so occurring is that the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600 
what's more so occurring is that the
presence<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:43.489> providing<00:00:44.489> an

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
presence of this thing is providing an

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
presence of this thing is providing an
obstruction<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> structures<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.110> each

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
obstruction to the structures on each

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
obstruction to the structures on each
side<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> knee<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.539> what<00:00:48.539> that's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
side of the knee and what that's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
side of the knee and what that's
basically<00:00:48.899> doing<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.680> providing<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
basically doing is just providing a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.510 
basically doing is just providing a
massage<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.829> while<00:00:52.829> they're<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> flexion

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
massage on them while they're in flexion

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
massage on them while they're in flexion
which<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> keep<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> hard<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
which you keep it's hard to do that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
which you keep it's hard to do that
without<00:00:55.379> may<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.280> expert<00:00:56.579> massage<00:00:56.879> person

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
without may be an expert massage person

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
without may be an expert massage person
so<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.800> doing<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.129> kind<00:00:59.250> of

portion of my knee right where that
attachment<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> popliteus<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:06.119> where

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
attachment the popliteus is right where

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
attachment the popliteus is right where
the<00:01:06.390> hamstrings<00:01:06.990> come<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> cross<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the hamstrings come down to cross the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
the hamstrings come down to cross the
knee<00:01:08.040> joint<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> gastroc<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
gastrocnemius the wood of the big calf

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.280 
gastrocnemius the wood of the big calf
muscle<00:01:12.060> comes<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> cross<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> knee<00:01:13.049> joint

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
muscle comes up to cross the knee joint

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
muscle comes up to cross the knee joint
and<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:13.860> where<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.130> IT<00:01:15.060> band<00:01:15.450> comes<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and right where my IT band comes down on

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
and right where my IT band comes down on
the<00:01:16.530> lateral<00:01:16.830> portion<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> knee<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.759> I'm

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the lateral portion of the knee so I'm

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.310 
the lateral portion of the knee so I'm
I'm<00:01:18.150> kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> rocking<00:01:18.840> back<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.020> forth

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I'm kind of rocking back and forth

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
I'm kind of rocking back and forth
applying<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.430> stress<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.939> my

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
applying a little bit more stress of my

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.719 
applying a little bit more stress of my
hands<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> push<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:22.020> vastus<00:01:22.560> lateralis<00:01:22.860> which

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
hands to push my vastus lateralis which

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
hands to push my vastus lateralis which
is<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.530> part<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> quad<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
is just this part of the quad on the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
is just this part of the quad on the
side<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> push<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> towel

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
side here to push it down into the towel

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
side here to push it down into the towel
so<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.340> massaging<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so we can get a little massaging in that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.370 
so we can get a little massaging in that
area<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> same<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
area you can get the same thing on the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.160 
area you can get the same thing on the
medial<00:01:31.680> portion<00:01:32.180> adding<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.750> adding<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
medial portion adding in I'm adding in a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
medial portion adding in I'm adding in a
little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> extra<00:01:34.890> force<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.880> basically

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
little bit of extra force and basically

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.590 
little bit of extra force and basically
what<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.170> doing<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> massaging

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
what I'm doing is just massaging

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.060 
what I'm doing is just massaging
all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> structures<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.890> with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
all the structures right in here with

that towel while I'm in flexion so that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
that towel while I'm in flexion so that
can<00:01:44.939> help<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> alleviate<00:01:45.720> those

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
can help kind of alleviate those

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
can help kind of alleviate those
structures<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.799> also<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.310> hit

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
structures and you can also kind of hit

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
structures and you can also kind of hit
up<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.820> popliteus<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
up that popliteus a little bit on the

up that popliteus a little bit on the
back<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> knee<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.490> remember<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
back of the knee just remember that it's

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.359 
back of the knee just remember that it's
deep<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> gastroc

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
deep to the gastroc

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
deep to the gastroc
it's<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.850> easily<00:01:54.060> massaged<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.990> maybe<00:01:55.560> work

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
it's not easily massaged but maybe work

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's not easily massaged but maybe work
in<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:56.460> kind<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> alleviate

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
in this and it will kind of alleviate

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.350 
in this and it will kind of alleviate
all<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.570> tension<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> area<00:01:59.000> the<00:02:00.000> second

all the tension in the area the second
thing<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> could<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.469> bike<00:02:01.799> inner

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
thing you could do is get a bike inner

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
thing you could do is get a bike inner
tube<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> call<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:04.020> voodoo

term and I'll address that in a future
post<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> video<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.020> make

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
post and video but you can just make

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.390 
post and video but you can just make
this<00:02:10.319> out<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.649> bike<00:02:10.830> inner<00:02:11.009> tube<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
this out of a bike inner tube it's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
this out of a bike inner tube it's
pretty<00:02:11.610> simple<00:02:11.910> anyway<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.810> wrap

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pretty simple anyway you can wrap

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.500 
pretty simple anyway you can wrap
your<00:02:15.890> proximal<00:02:16.890> calf<00:02:17.130> area<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:18.120> below<00:02:18.390> the

your proximal calf area right below the
knee<00:02:19.610> pretty<00:02:20.610> tightly<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.160> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
knee pretty tightly with this and it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.800 
knee pretty tightly with this and it
doesn't<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.610> much<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.420> increasing

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
doesn't have much to do with increasing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
doesn't have much to do with increasing
blood<00:02:25.200> flow<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.770> stuff<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> well

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
blood flow and all that stuff to it well

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.100 
blood flow and all that stuff to it well
what<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.000> doing<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.420> actually<00:02:27.750> working<00:02:27.930> on

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
what is doing is actually working on

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.300 
what is doing is actually working on
some<00:02:28.290> structures<00:02:28.680> again<00:02:28.980> I'll<00:02:29.130> talk<00:02:29.280> about

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
some structures again I'll talk about

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.620 
some structures again I'll talk about
this<00:02:29.550> again<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.000> future<00:02:30.120> post<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
this again in the future post and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.290 
this again in the future post and
everything<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.650> wrap<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.700> take

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
everything but you can wrap it up take

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000 
everything but you can wrap it up take
it<00:02:33.330> through<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.959> full<00:02:34.349> range<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.620> motion<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
it through a full range of motion in the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.630 
it through a full range of motion in the
knee<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.420> full<00:02:36.930> knee<00:02:37.080> flexion<00:02:37.430> pull<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.519> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
knee of a full knee flexion pull it to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
knee of a full knee flexion pull it to
your<00:02:38.790> butt<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.810> actually

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
your butt and then you can actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.430 
your butt and then you can actually
physically<00:02:41.599> laterally<00:02:42.599> immediately<00:02:43.050> rotate

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
physically laterally immediately rotate

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.140 
physically laterally immediately rotate
at<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> knee<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.430> that's<00:02:44.849> just<00:02:44.910> gonna

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
at the knee here and that's just gonna

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.400 
at the knee here and that's just gonna
work<00:02:45.269> on<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> structures<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.049> same<00:02:46.260> way

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
work on the structures in the same way

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.320 
work on the structures in the same way
that<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> towel<00:02:46.830> did<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.760> also<00:02:47.910> use<00:02:48.299> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
that the towel did you can also use a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.870 
that the towel did you can also use a
heavy<00:02:48.930> ace<00:02:49.049> bandage<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.069> same<00:02:50.280> area<00:02:50.549> and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
heavy ace bandage on the same area and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.050 
heavy ace bandage on the same area and
there<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.390> some<00:02:52.190> more<00:02:53.190> uses<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.880> get<00:02:53.970> out

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
there are some more uses you can get out

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.670 
there are some more uses you can get out
of<00:02:54.180> an<00:02:54.239> ace<00:02:54.360> bandage<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.989> can't<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.470> out

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of an ace bandage that you can't get out

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.840 
of an ace bandage that you can't get out
of<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> these<00:02:56.100> bands<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.549> I'll<00:02:56.670> address

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
of one of these bands and I'll address

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.490 
of one of these bands and I'll address
that<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> future<00:02:57.450> post<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.349> could

that in the future post but you could

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.630 
that in the future post but you could
use<00:02:58.620> either<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.040> these<00:02:59.130> things<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.610> work

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
use either one of these things to work

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.670 
use either one of these things to work
on<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.090> specific<00:03:00.540> area<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.560> even

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
on this specific area and you can even

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.960 
on this specific area and you can even
use<00:03:01.980> another<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.730> hit<00:03:02.849> up<00:03:02.940> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
use another one to hit up that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.910 
use another one to hit up that
suprapatellar<00:03:03.450> pouch<00:03:03.690> these<00:03:04.349> hamstrings<00:03:04.799> and

stuff just releasing tension at the knee
overall<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.860> way<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.400> prevent

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the mobility to do so remember that the

the mobility to do so remember that the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
point your toes forward like this and a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.259 
point your toes forward like this and a
loaded<00:03:28.709> squat<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.609> able<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.819> do<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
loaded squat is to be able to do the

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.150 
loaded squat is to be able to do the
Paleo<00:03:30.600> squad<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.290> show<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.650> knees<00:03:31.829> out<00:03:31.980> with

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
Paleo squad and show your knees out with

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.009 
Paleo squad and show your knees out with
your<00:03:32.280> chest<00:03:32.549> up<00:03:32.730> without<00:03:33.359> falling<00:03:33.690> over<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
your chest up without falling over and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.960 
your chest up without falling over and
without<00:03:34.260> tweaking<00:03:34.650> something<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.700> your

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
without tweaking something if your

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.590 
without tweaking something if your
normal<00:03:36.299> squat<00:03:36.630> stance<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.140> here<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.420> 45<00:03:39.420> degree

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
normal squat stance is here a 45 degree

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.210 
normal squat stance is here a 45 degree
angle<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.260> suggest<00:03:40.440> bringing<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.100> in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
angle then I suggest bringing it in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.599 
angle then I suggest bringing it in
slightly<00:03:41.489> maybe<00:03:42.590> here<00:03:43.590> around<00:03:43.980> 30<00:03:44.280> degrees

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
slightly maybe here around 30 degrees

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.150 
slightly maybe here around 30 degrees
perhaps<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.389> don't<00:03:45.930> think<00:03:46.139> if<00:03:46.290> she<00:03:46.410> ever<00:03:46.500> be<00:03:46.709> 45

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
perhaps I don't think if she ever be 45

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
perhaps I don't think if she ever be 45
degrees<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.579> 30<00:03:48.000> degrees<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.480> fine<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:48.959> most

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
degrees but 30 degrees is fine for most

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.830 
degrees but 30 degrees is fine for most
people<00:03:49.410> if<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.010> normally<00:03:50.370> squat<00:03:50.639> here<00:03:51.120> then

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
people if you normally squat here then

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.690 
people if you normally squat here then
move<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.620> little<00:03:52.829> bit<00:03:52.950> maybe<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.400> 20

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
move it in a little bit maybe that's 20

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.400 
move it in a little bit maybe that's 20
degrees<00:03:53.940> who<00:03:54.299> cares<00:03:54.569> just<00:03:54.720> move<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.109> in<00:03:55.200> just<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
degrees who cares just move it in just a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.710 
degrees who cares just move it in just a
little<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.519> point<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.299> you

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
little bit the point is that you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.000 
little bit the point is that you
shouldn't<00:03:57.959> put<00:03:58.109> yourself<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.769> position

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
shouldn't put yourself in a position

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.440 
shouldn't put yourself in a position
that<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.609> have<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> tweak<00:04:00.120> because

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
that is going to have the tweak because

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.170 
that is going to have the tweak because
I<00:04:00.480> told<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.840> not<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.049> do<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.370> but<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.940> do

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
I told you not to do that but if you do

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.770 
I told you not to do that but if you do
do<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
do that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.289 
do that
now<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:03.989> know<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.889> going<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.549> at<00:04:05.910> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
now you know what is going on at the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.539 
now you know what is going on at the
popliteal<00:04:06.840> area<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.950> back<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.370> knee

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
popliteal area in the back of the knee

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.400 
popliteal area in the back of the knee
that<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:08.940> causing<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.450> injury<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.350> you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that is causing that injury and now you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.259 
that is causing that injury and now you
have<00:04:10.739> some<00:04:10.980> ways<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.190> actually<00:04:11.549> work<00:04:11.970> on<00:04:12.090> those

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
have some ways to actually work on those

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.610 
have some ways to actually work on those
structures<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.840> prevent<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.260> from<00:04:13.290> occurring

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
structures to prevent it from occurring

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.100 
structures to prevent it from occurring
in<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.950> future
