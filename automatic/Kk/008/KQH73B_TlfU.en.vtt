00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
it's obviously much more affordable so

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.610 
it's obviously much more affordable so
it's<00:05:27.730> like<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.360> know<00:05:28.480> still<00:05:28.870> blue<00:05:29.080> going<00:05:29.320> into

months<00:06:00.910> ago<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:01.390> think<00:06:01.600> sometimes<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.380> color

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
months ago I think sometimes the color

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.590 
months ago I think sometimes the color
drives<00:06:03.040> me<00:06:03.310> more<00:06:03.490> than<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.760> formula<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.450> it's

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
drives me more than the formula so it's

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.450 
drives me more than the formula so it's
like<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:05.110> really<00:06:05.800> want<00:06:05.950> to<00:06:06.010> own<00:06:06.100> that<00:06:06.130> color
