the<00:00:55.359> other<00:00:55.480> thing<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.690> course<00:00:55.749> is<00:00:56.050> in<00:00:56.499> its

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the other thing of course is in its

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.410 
the other thing of course is in its
technical<00:00:57.160> kind<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.399> capability<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:58.059> aspects

technical kind of capability and aspects

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.630 
technical kind of capability and aspects
we've<00:00:58.539> gone<00:00:58.659> back<00:00:58.899> to<00:00:59.109> Mel<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.440> fighting<00:00:59.980> we've

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
we've gone back to Mel a fighting we've

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.009 
we've gone back to Mel a fighting we've
massively<00:01:01.059> increased<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> number<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.870> units

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
massively increased the number of units

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.509 
massively increased the number of units
that<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.350> can<00:01:02.469> see<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.739> screen<00:01:02.890> during<00:01:03.280> your

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
that you can see on screen during your

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.550 
that you can see on screen during your
own<00:01:03.640> battles<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.810> final<00:01:05.110> main<00:01:05.260> point<00:01:05.500> I

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
own battles and the final main point I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.960 
own battles and the final main point I
guess<00:01:05.650> from<00:01:06.010> a<00:01:06.040> gameplay<00:01:06.220> point<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.640> view<00:01:06.790> is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
guess from a gameplay point of view is

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.180 
guess from a gameplay point of view is
that<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:07.360> have<00:01:07.600> sea<00:01:08.440> battles<00:01:08.860> which<00:01:09.010> also

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
that we now have sea battles which also

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.100 
that we now have sea battles which also
combine<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> land<00:01:10.030> element<00:01:10.510> into<00:01:10.630> them<00:01:10.870> so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
combine a land element into them so

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.390 
combine a land element into them so
you'll<00:01:11.500> find<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.860> lot<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.040> your<00:01:12.220> see

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
you'll find a lot of your see

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.220 
you'll find a lot of your see
engagements<00:01:12.940> around<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.180> coast<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.600> Japan<00:01:13.960> so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
engagements around the coast of Japan so

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.510 
engagements around the coast of Japan so
you'll<00:01:14.620> have<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.860> deal<00:01:15.010> with<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.250> random<00:01:15.430> all

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
you'll have to deal with the random all

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.310 
you'll have to deal with the random all
these<00:01:15.640> rocks<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.120> shoals<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.660> beaches<00:01:17.110> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
good example of where this can go right
or<00:02:56.970> wrong<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:58.110> your<00:02:58.230> generals<00:02:58.680> your

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
or wrong is with your generals your

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.440 
or wrong is with your generals your
generals<00:02:59.670> if<00:02:59.820> they<00:02:59.940> feel<00:03:00.120> underappreciated

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
generals if they feel underappreciated

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.720 
generals if they feel underappreciated
their<00:03:01.110> loyalty<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.500> begin<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.800> drop<00:03:02.040> when<00:03:02.640> it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
their loyalty will begin to drop when it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.820 
their loyalty will begin to drop when it
drops<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.150> certain<00:03:03.510> point<00:03:03.720> they'll<00:03:04.650> be

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
drops to a certain point they'll be

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.890 
drops to a certain point they'll be
basically<00:03:05.610> subject<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.209> potentially<00:03:06.750> being

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
basically subject to potentially being

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900 
basically subject to potentially being
bribed<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.650> by<00:03:07.770> an<00:03:07.890> enemy<00:03:08.040> mitsuko<00:03:08.730> or

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
bribed over by an enemy mitsuko or

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
bribed over by an enemy mitsuko or
potentially<00:03:09.780> even<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.590> rogan

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
potentially even going you know rogan

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.130 
potentially even going you know rogan
and<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.430> their<00:03:11.550> own<00:03:11.670> way<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.780> then<00:03:13.020> get

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and go in their own way so you then get

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.080 
and go in their own way so you then get
the<00:03:13.260> option<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.770> wish<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.250> demand<00:03:14.880> that

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the option if you wish to demand that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.380 
the option if you wish to demand that
they<00:03:15.180> commit<00:03:15.480> seppuku<00:03:15.660> or<00:03:16.080> ritual<00:03:16.440> suicide<00:03:16.590> I

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
they commit seppuku or ritual suicide I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.490 
they commit seppuku or ritual suicide I
translate<00:03:18.390> something<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.660> belly<00:03:18.870> cutting<00:03:19.320> but

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
translate something as belly cutting but

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
translate something as belly cutting but
basically<00:03:20.070> these<00:03:20.310> guys<00:03:20.549> then<00:03:21.209> actually

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
basically these guys then actually

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.330 
basically these guys then actually
choose<00:03:21.989> whether<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.890> kill<00:03:23.160> themselves
