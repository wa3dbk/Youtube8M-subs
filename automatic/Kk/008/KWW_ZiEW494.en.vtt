 my colleagues pass to warm to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 a determine who has made you so commercial 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.289

 good afternoon with which i can help you 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.979
 prefer something with the gift bombs though 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.869
 to cities that are next week 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.890
 officially my grandiose 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.970
 promotional campaign 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 but of course we have to get in first 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.530
 thorough consultation with the middle class 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 determined value of each boontje 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 otherwise we naturally get a whole 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.869
 unclear situation that understands 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 you are 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 you have a greengrocer and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 For example, you assume one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.210
 I would ask for cauliflower 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:35.430
 cauliflower or red ball or one or one 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 red and blue receipt yes they must be 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 where the poor wait i can take you 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.060
 for example, already 2 sing blue in one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.729
 red is a kilo for the butcher 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.290
 minced meat and for example red and blue 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.670
 is when the frying on the square is there 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.850
 what it says is a bear's foot 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.310

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.590

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.170

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 lease the mobile de massage salon des 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.420
 to start growing receipts 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.530

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.180

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.620
 consultation in their comparisons 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.190
