these is the vo2 point2 frame basically

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.060 
these is the vo2 point2 frame basically
just<00:00:43.630> an<00:00:43.750> aluminum<00:00:44.200> frame<00:00:44.380> but<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:44.950> is

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
just an aluminum frame but it is

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.310 
just an aluminum frame but it is
designed<00:00:45.490> for<00:00:45.579> stability<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.570> support<00:00:46.900> as

vo2 series skates the cuff on it is the
vo2max<00:01:37.959> cuff<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:39.130> you're<00:01:39.249> going<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.399> get<00:01:39.549> good

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
vo2max cuff so you're going to get good

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.669 
vo2max cuff so you're going to get good
stability<00:01:40.090> on<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:40.749> but<00:01:41.079> you're<00:01:41.200> also<00:01:41.350> going<00:01:41.619> to

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
stability on it but you're also going to

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.769 
stability on it but you're also going to
have<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.889> lot<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.159> support<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.789> flex<00:01:43.509> when

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
have a lot of support and flex when

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:45.629 
have a lot of support and flex when
you're<00:01:43.899> skating<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.529> that<00:01:44.679> power<00:01:44.859> transfer<00:01:45.459> is

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
you're skating so that power transfer is

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.690 
you're skating so that power transfer is
increased<00:01:46.630> there<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.349> it<00:01:47.499> the<00:01:48.219> liner

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
increased there because of it the liner

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.120 
increased there because of it the liner
inside<00:01:49.209> is<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.810> ultra<00:01:50.319> long<00:01:50.499> liner<00:01:50.859> which

inside is the ultra long liner which

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.219 
inside is the ultra long liner which
