an uninsured patient the laboratory that

does have a financial hardship program

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.870 
does have a financial hardship program
like<00:00:30.239> most<00:00:30.860> large<00:00:31.860> laboratories<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.579> well<00:00:32.730> as

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
like most large laboratories as well as

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
like most large laboratories as well as
some<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> pharmaceutical<00:00:34.079> companies

some of the pharmaceutical companies

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.690 
some of the pharmaceutical companies
have<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.480> often<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.920> genetic<00:00:38.219> testing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have so we often can get genetic testing

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
have so we often can get genetic testing
covered<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.930> instance<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.530> its

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
covered in the instance with its

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
covered in the instance with its
indicated<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> patient<00:00:42.090> does<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.420> have

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
insurance coverage the the other thing

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.210 
insurance coverage the the other thing
to<00:00:45.390> consider<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.990> you<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.590> who<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.040> most

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
to consider is you know who is the most

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.430 
to consider is you know who is the most
appropriate<00:00:47.340> person<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.540> family<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:49.140> test

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
appropriate person in the family to test

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.980 
appropriate person in the family to test
is<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.430> someone<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.820> may<00:00:51.240> be<00:00:51.300> able<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.720> get

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
is there someone that may be able to get

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.569 
is there someone that may be able to get
cut<00:00:52.200> may<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.470> able<00:00:52.740> to<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.190> coverage<00:00:53.370> for

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
cut may be able to get coverage for

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
cut may be able to get coverage for
testing<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.050> close<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.680> door

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
testing and could really close the door

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
testing and could really close the door
for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> family<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.540> your<00:00:57.720> instance

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
for the family so like in your instance

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
for the family so like in your instance
Lisa<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:59.220> were<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.550> youngest<00:00:59.700> person<00:00:59.970> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
Lisa you were the youngest person in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.390 
Lisa you were the youngest person in
your<00:01:00.390> family<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.900> cancer<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.440> 42<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.250> say

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
your family to have cancer at 42 and say

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.490 
your family to have cancer at 42 and say
you're<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.610> most<00:01:02.910> suspicious<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you're the most suspicious and your

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
you're the most suspicious and your
genetic<00:01:04.890> testing<00:01:05.189> was<00:01:05.339> negative<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
genetic testing was negative and so that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
genetic testing was negative and so that
tells<00:01:06.810> us<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.860> answer<00:01:08.009> for

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
tells us that it's not the answer for

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.450 
tells us that it's not the answer for
your<00:01:08.460> cancer<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> thus<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.290> your<00:01:10.439> sister<00:01:10.860> she

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
your cancer and thus for your sister she

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
your cancer and thus for your sister she
probably<00:01:11.729> doesn't<00:01:12.149> need<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> genetic

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
probably doesn't need the genetic

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
probably doesn't need the genetic
testing<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> wouldn't<00:01:13.920> give<00:01:14.189> her<00:01:14.369> any

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
testing because it wouldn't give her any

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
testing because it wouldn't give her any
information<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.899> explanation<00:01:16.469> for

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
information it's not the explanation for

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520 
information it's not the explanation for
yours<00:01:16.889> and<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.369> there's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.149> lot<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.359> ways<00:01:18.719> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
yours and so there's a lot of ways to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
yours and so there's a lot of ways to
kind<00:01:19.829> of<00:01:19.979> work<00:01:20.249> through<00:01:20.609> how<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.149> get<00:01:21.359> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
kind of work through how to get that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.809 
kind of work through how to get that
genetic<00:01:21.869> testing<00:01:22.289> who<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.889> the<00:01:22.950> family<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.399> to

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
genetic testing who and the family to to

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.520 
genetic testing who and the family to to
get<00:01:23.939> tested<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.539> if<00:01:24.990> there's<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.350> no

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
get tested and if there's really no

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.139 
get tested and if there's really no
coverage<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.130> work<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.549> laboratory<00:01:27.060> or

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
coverage to work with the laboratory or

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.209

other not-for-profit organizations to

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.170 
other not-for-profit organizations to
get<00:01:29.369> coverage<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.729> it
