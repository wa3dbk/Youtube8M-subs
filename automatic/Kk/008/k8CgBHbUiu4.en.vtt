00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.960
 hello, modest Flavors from the kitchen armful loves 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.560
 we have a local recipe in this section 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.320
 We will learn "Izmir Artichoke Stuffing" 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 of course, a description of the different regions of Izmir 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.280
 we are preparing with the interpretation of Modest Taste 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.280
 but if you want to learn the materials first 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 6 pieces of cleaned artichoke dish 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 1 cup of rice 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.760
 4 fresh onions 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 10-15 branches of parsley 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 half a bunch of dill 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.800
 5-6 sprigs of fresh mint 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 1 tablespoon pine nuts 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 1 tablespoon currants 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 half a teaspoon black pepper 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 1 piece of lemon 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 and 1.5 tea glass of olive oil 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 yes we are ready to make our recipe healthy and delicious 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Let's start by chopping our fresh onions 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.160
 white parts can be hard we think we cut in half from the middle 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.400
 and slim as much as we can 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 we start to leave in the rough order 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.880
 Our dill is a little too much 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600
 we will use some of it as an ornament on 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.840
 we separate this 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.680
 row of parsley 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 adding parsley 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.560
 we have fresh mint leaves 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.240
 fresh mint has a very sharp taste ... 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 I don't recommend using more 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.880
 last mint 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 the rice we wash now ... 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 we wash the bird ... 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 pepper ... 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 pine nuts, if you're aware of it all ... 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 salt... 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.480
 Add up to 1 tea cup of olive oil 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 add the rest after cooking 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.280
 and 1 large tea cup warm water 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280
 a beautiful stir 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.040
 we are ready 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.200
 now we put our bowls in the pot 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.240
 we leave plenty of internally prepared pots 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.320
 After placing our inner ... 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.720
 we will also place our lemon slices to be delicious 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.040
 to keep both color ... 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.320
 Lemon is accompanied by very nice to give flavor 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.840
 Now we're putting water up to 1 big tea cup 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.840
 but this water is never enough 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.920
 we can add a little more after we start cooking 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:59.480
 We wet our greaseproof paper and cover the stuffing 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.120
 now we can go by the fire 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.080
 we put our stuff in the fire 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.800
 now we're closing 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.760
 after half an hour 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.760
 After half an hour 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.200
 half an hour expired slowly began to soften 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.240
 we open the side and add 1 cup of hot water 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.960
 we cook for another half an hour 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 After half an hour 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.480
 we are closing the alarm, we are closing the stove 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.400
 20 minutes without opening the cover of our own steam 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.040
 20 minutes later 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.520
 open the lid of the dolma 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 also take paper 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.080
 great 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.400
 If you remember half a cup of tea as we had increased 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 now hover over 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.600
 And we've increased some dill, 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.120
 Let's transfer to a beautifully cooked plate 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.960
 warm or cold 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.560
 we reached out to our beautiful Izmir 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.880
 and the famous food ... 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.880
 We shared the description of Izmir-style artichoke filling 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.120
 I wish you and us remember Izmir 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.960
 goodbye...
