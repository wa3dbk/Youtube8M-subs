fringe which you can kind of downplay
them

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
them

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.699 
them
so<00:02:06.280> now<00:02:06.520> what<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.659> graphs<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.200> left<00:02:08.470> in

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so now what I do is I graphs it left in

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.430 
so now what I do is I graphs it left in
the<00:02:08.830> right<00:02:09.099> side<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.510> then<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:13.750> separate<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the right side and then I separate the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.820 
the right side and then I separate the
tops<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> bottoms<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.230> when<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.560> pull<00:02:17.800> on

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
tops and the bottoms so when I pull on

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.630 
tops and the bottoms so when I pull on
the<00:02:18.099> top<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:20.200> gonna<00:02:20.349> tighten<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.489> when<00:02:21.610> I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the top it's gonna tighten up and when I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.570 
the top it's gonna tighten up and when I
pull<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.269> bottom<00:02:22.450> ropes<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:24.400> gonna

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
pull on the bottom ropes it's gonna

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
pull on the bottom ropes it's gonna
tighten<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.120> bottom<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.630> make<00:02:25.780> that

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
tighten the bottom to make that

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.040 
tighten the bottom to make that
hourglass<00:02:26.620> look<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.239> kind<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.540> alternate

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
hourglass look so I kind of alternate

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.110 
hourglass look so I kind of alternate
between<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.560> two<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:30.099> get<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.550> my<00:02:30.700> desired

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
between the two to get it to my desired

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.660 
between the two to get it to my desired
finish<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.799> while<00:02:35.950> maintaining<00:02:36.190> your

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
finish all the while maintaining your

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.250 
finish all the while maintaining your
breathing<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.630> don't<00:02:37.810> want<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.019> over

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
breathing because you don't want to over

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.289 
breathing because you don't want to over
oxygenate<00:02:38.830> yourself<00:02:39.250> cuz<00:02:39.910> that's<00:02:40.060> when<00:02:40.209> you

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
oxygenate yourself cuz that's when you

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.569 
oxygenate yourself cuz that's when you
pass<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:43.140> cool<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.860> when<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.459> to

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
pass out cool then when I have it to

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.809 
pass out cool then when I have it to
where<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.790> want<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.299> take<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.660> two<00:02:46.840> sides<00:02:47.819> and

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
where I want I take the two sides and

00:02:48.819 --> 00:03:03.539 
where I want I take the two sides and
just<00:02:49.120> tie<00:02:49.329> them<00:02:49.569> in<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> bow<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> I've<00:03:03.280> done<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
just tie them in a bow so I've done it

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.290 
just tie them in a bow so I've done it
myself<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.239> now<00:03:04.390> I'm<00:03:04.510> ready<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:05.079> out
