00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620 

God<00:02:14.390> now<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.160> said<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.210> I've<00:02:17.300> said<00:02:17.510> this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
God now like I said and I've said this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.690 
God now like I said and I've said this
in<00:02:17.840> many<00:02:18.350> interviews<00:02:18.710> which<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.160> fun<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.370> it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
in many interviews which is fun and it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520 
in many interviews which is fun and it
still<00:02:20.030> holds<00:02:20.360> true<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.200> good

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
still holds true so it's one of the good

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.280 
still holds true so it's one of the good
constants<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.370> my<00:02:22.640> life<00:02:22.850> if<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:23.810> ever<00:02:23.960> asked

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
constants in my life if I'm ever asked

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.630 
constants in my life if I'm ever asked
to<00:02:24.380> go<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.650> desert<00:02:24.860> island<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.520> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
to go on a desert island I have to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.340 
to go on a desert island I have to
choose<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.000> scores<00:02:26.300> or<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> recordings<00:02:27.110> it

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
choose the scores or the recordings it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.500 
choose the scores or the recordings it
better<00:02:27.680> be<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> huge<00:02:28.250> island<00:02:28.430> because<00:02:29.300> there's

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
better be a huge island because there's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.080 
better be a huge island because there's
lots<00:02:30.100> really<00:02:31.100> really<00:02:31.370> lots<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:31.790> very

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
lots really really lots it's very

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.230 
lots really really lots it's very
difficult<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.660> narrow<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.990> down<00:02:33.820> most<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
difficult to narrow it down most of the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.640 
difficult to narrow it down most of the
times<00:02:35.480> when<00:02:35.690> there's<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.900> memorable<00:02:36.410> concert

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
times when there's a memorable concert

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.860 
times when there's a memorable concert
in<00:02:37.070> my<00:02:37.280> mind<00:02:37.640> something<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.720> had

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
in my mind something that I had

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.050 
in my mind something that I had
particular<00:02:39.500> pleasure<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.580> was<00:02:40.700> probably

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
particular pleasure in it was probably

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.250 
particular pleasure in it was probably
because<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> instrument<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> was<00:02:42.020> playing

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because of the instrument I was playing

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.120 
because of the instrument I was playing
in<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.000> probably<00:02:44.480> has<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:45.080> with<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
in and that probably has to do with the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
in and that probably has to do with the
condition<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.940> which<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.330> piano<00:02:47.600> was

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
condition to which the piano was

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.130 
condition to which the piano was
prepared<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.500> when<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.430> stage<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.989> by

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
prepared so when I'm on stage and I'm by

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.930 
prepared so when I'm on stage and I'm by
myself<00:02:51.320> or<00:02:51.620> with<00:02:51.650> an<00:02:51.830> orchestra<00:02:52.130> if<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:52.790> an

myself or with an orchestra if I have an

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
ones where my brain synapses really get

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.220 
ones where my brain synapses really get
going<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.360> those<00:03:08.660> are<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> ones<00:03:09.050> where<00:03:09.170> I
