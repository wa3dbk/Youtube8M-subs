00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 no 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.049
 according to jesus christ sources 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.049
 the only son of eternal pep 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:19.980
 it paid 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.569
 with you 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.369
 among the arguments put forward by those who want to prove 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 that the church stands out faithful to the gospel 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.300
 there is the fact that she calls the priests 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.839
 those who wish to contradict 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.200
 with the will of Jesus 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.510
 ask 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.120
 he called your father's people 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.590
 on the plain 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 because american crude the heavenly father 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.530
 to this it must be answered that in the gospel itself 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 the world still not allow not applied to god 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.459
 for example 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.730
 his car the girls 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.870
 that the cbb was killed the father 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.950
 on each side two people 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.000
 this nature 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 purpose therefore work the gospels 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 it includes for the most vulnerable to shells 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.159
 if it is true that he should not use the word father 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.840
 I quickly 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 he completes 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220
 say exactly what the number of pv says 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.020
 this pole 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.360
 does not claim the foot of paternity when he writes to 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.280
 corinthians 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.550
 could you have published since the closing 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.150
 that you do not have more 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.780
 several pairs 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120
 because it's me 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.950
 who by the gospel 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 you ranged to enter Christ Jesus 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.079
 the mother of jesus found at the temple 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.870
 to perpetuate month 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.199
 always in the race 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.009
 we will not stop 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 so little earlier 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.980
 either m the samp licked the immaculate conception 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.039
 Jesus himself 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.159
 use 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.789
 the word outdoor 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.929
 for others than his own 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.559
 for example when he says 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.239
 whoever loses his father 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.469
 it turns out more than me 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.469
 he told me about me 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 north your father and your mother 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.739
 or at the address of those 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.789
 who refused to believe in him 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:46.889
 twelve round trips 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.889
 devil pearl 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.379
 I'm sure the team so himself 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.499
 the accusation we are denouncing therefore shows the appropriateness of sega 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.120
 those who want to understand the scriptures using their soil 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.990
 intelligence and in defiance of the warning of saint-pierre 10 years 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.449
 before all sochi 2 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.970
 no prophecy of writing is not obliged tel 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.970
 personal interpretation 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.049
 it is an effect only in the communion of the church 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.679
 that the holy spirit 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.699
 real 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.699
 the meaning of the word of god 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.629
 and what ethics of the site 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.300
 well so much suffering it's jesus a volume not only have we avoided 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.910
 to live with god source of their resistance 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.689
 still children with his father 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.609
 that is to say in gratitude 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.129
 humility 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.750
 obedience 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.529
 alas trust 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.719
 but still reveal us 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.399
 the first person of las 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.699
 m from the beginning 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.059
 committing the 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.239
 the pen 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.619
 article read 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.669
 that is to say 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.669
 of himself and for himself 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.359
 even though 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.400
 from whom 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.010
 all paternity also she 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.409
 and under the earth 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.370
 get his name 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.610
 so that the father and the mother 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.889
 and they are good clean 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.249
 at the same time that man becomes a father 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.300
 by communicating victims 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.219
 likewise read them call belga the priests 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.030
 because water is 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.460
 through the preaching of the gospel and the sacraments 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.620
 communicated life 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.950
 but have no opinion that natural mortals 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.070
 but the eternal divine wild 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.670
 that of christ 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.150
 at one point 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.800
 at the cost of five dead 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.749
 this increases 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.489
 the criticism that our three novels the heirs of reform make that this 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:10.450
 use 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.889
 of the church a little loss of priests 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.580
 obviously proceed 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.009
 of the visceral refusal of the authority of the church 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.720
 embodied by the good end of his approach 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.610
 refusal of the authority erected in principal 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.400
 that of men 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.220
 at the source of the French Revolution 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.810
 from those of May 68 and today's society 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.490
 where the father is no longer beautiful or bad 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
 it was exploded it must still recognize 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.020
 for philippe provencher of the republican motto 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.009
 freedom 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.670
 keith and equality are easily revoked 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.910
 it's not the same with the fraternity 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:58.610
 and why 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.630
 otherwise because I admit doing it 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.770
 the avicca the existence of the same father 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.990
 of God 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.400
 the leader 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.550
 that we do not want anymore 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.050
 buemi do not recognize nor love 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.050
 and with whom we do not want obelix anymore 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.099
 God's Son 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.460
 gives us to help us all as brothers 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.520
 in jesus 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.249
 and as a jesus 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.249
