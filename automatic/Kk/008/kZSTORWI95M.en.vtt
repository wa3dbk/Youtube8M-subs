way through crowds of enemies with no
trouble<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.719> mean<00:00:39.899> honestly<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
trouble I mean honestly at first I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.540 
trouble I mean honestly at first I
thought<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.250> more<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
thought it's going to be more of a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
thought it's going to be more of a
novelty<00:00:41.780> but<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:42.899> I'm<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
novelty but now I'm actually kind of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
novelty but now I'm actually kind of
keeping<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.160> times<00:00:44.239> I'm<00:00:45.239> not

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
keeping it on me at all times I'm not

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
keeping it on me at all times I'm not
even<00:00:45.600> sure<00:00:45.629> why<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.260> honestly<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.829> guess

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
even sure why this is honestly I guess

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
even sure why this is honestly I guess
continuous<00:00:48.270> damage<00:00:48.629> bonus<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.110> two<00:00:49.230> hundred

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
continuous damage bonus of two hundred

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
continuous damage bonus of two hundred
percent<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.579> pretty<00:00:50.969> average

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
percent that's actually pretty average

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.110 
percent that's actually pretty average
for<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> beam<00:00:51.809> weapon<00:00:52.170> I've<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> thorny<00:00:53.940> rose

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
for a beam weapon I've got a thorny rose

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
for a beam weapon I've got a thorny rose
that's<00:00:54.510> another<00:00:54.750> unique<00:00:55.820> continuous<00:00:56.820> beam

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's another unique continuous beam

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420 
that's another unique continuous beam
weapon<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:58.440> gives<00:00:58.649> over<00:00:58.829> five<00:00:59.100> hundred

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
weapon that gives over five hundred

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
weapon that gives over five hundred
percent<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
percent and all I can think of is that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
percent and all I can think of is that
although<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.670> no<00:01:03.239> element<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.930> bonus

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
although it has no element for bonus

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
although it has no element for bonus
damage<00:01:04.500> against<00:01:04.890> certain<00:01:05.100> enemy<00:01:05.460> types<00:01:05.670> for

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
example you know let fit gets a bonus

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
bonus against flesh et cetera it also

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.719 
bonus against flesh et cetera it also
has<00:01:12.570> no<00:01:12.840> enemy<00:01:13.560> type<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> especially

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
has no enemy type that is especially

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
has no enemy type that is especially
resistant<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:16.049> love<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> thorny

roses and incendiary beam but when

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
roses and incendiary beam but when
you're<00:01:18.659> fighting<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.110> mix<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.530> enemies<00:01:19.860> some<00:01:20.729> of

you're fighting a mix of enemies some of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
you're fighting a mix of enemies some of
whom<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.000> shields<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.320> damage<00:01:22.710> obviously

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
whom have shields the damage obviously

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.010 
whom have shields the damage obviously
drops<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.490> hugely<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.390> fire<00:01:24.659> weapons

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
drops off hugely because fire weapons

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
drops off hugely because fire weapons
are<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.259> ineffective<00:01:25.799> young<00:01:25.950> shields<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
are so ineffective young shields and you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670 
are so ineffective young shields and you
end<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.240> swap<00:01:28.080> backwards<00:01:28.560> and
