very<00:01:59.130> shiny<00:01:59.479> more<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.719> than<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.439> which

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
very shiny more so than this one which

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.780 
very shiny more so than this one which
does<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> over<00:02:03.119> lacquer<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> um
