kind<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> placed<00:00:23.790> out<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:24.990> this

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
kind of placed out what we need for this

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.799 
kind of placed out what we need for this
um<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:26.279> things<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:26.880> called<00:00:27.540> Hill

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:27.809 
um these things here are called Hill

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.810 
um these things here are called Hill
markers<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.770> that's<00:00:29.520> a<00:00:29.640> little

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
markers and I know that's a little

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
markers and I know that's a little
misleading<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:31.130> instantaneously<00:00:32.130> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
misleading because instantaneously or

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
misleading because instantaneously or
instantly<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> hill<00:00:34.440> marker<00:00:34.770> being

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
instantly I think of a hill marker being

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.120 
instantly I think of a hill marker being
for<00:00:35.280> king<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> hill<00:00:36.149> only<00:00:36.530> but<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.950> not

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
for king of the hill only but that's not

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.740 
for king of the hill only but that's not
true<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:39.440> worldwide<00:00:40.579> objective<00:00:41.750> marker

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
true it's a worldwide objective marker

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.910 
true it's a worldwide objective marker
that<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> used<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.890> any<00:00:44.540> game<00:00:45.920> specific

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that can be used for any game specific

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
that can be used for any game specific
game<00:00:47.130> type<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.490> it's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:48.420> type<00:00:48.690> specific

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
game type so it's a game type specific

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.540 
game type so it's a game type specific
object<00:00:50.329> it's<00:00:51.329> pretty<00:00:51.540> much<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.990> circle

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
object it's pretty much just a circle

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.740 
object it's pretty much just a circle
that's<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.700> it's<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.240> is<00:00:54.420> because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that's all it's all really is because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.620 
that's all it's all really is because
really<00:00:55.470> anything<00:00:56.040> can<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.880> game<00:00:57.390> type

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
really anything can be a game type

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.530 
really anything can be a game type

advanced game type ylabel that this
that's<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.899> read<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> determines<00:01:10.770> how

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that's you can read this determines how

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
that's you can read this determines how
a<00:01:10.979> game<00:01:11.310> type<00:01:11.520> uses<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.939> object<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
a game type uses this object and this is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.249 
a game type uses this object and this is
actually<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.009> king<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.460> hill<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.259> I'm

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
actually in king of the hill so I'm

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually in king of the hill so I'm
gonna<00:01:16.609> save<00:01:17.609> this<00:01:17.759> map<00:01:17.999> actually<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.490> put<00:01:20.490> two

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
gonna save this map actually I put two

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.020 
gonna save this map actually I put two
grids<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.929> these<00:01:22.499> will<00:01:22.710> serve<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.819> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
grids which these will serve if you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.949 
grids which these will serve if you
remember<00:01:25.249> these<00:01:26.249> will<00:01:26.459> serve<00:01:26.609> as<00:01:28.069> walls

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
remember these will serve as walls

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.779 
remember these will serve as walls
barriers<00:01:30.959> you<00:01:31.289> know<00:01:31.649> like<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> invasion

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
barriers you know like in the invasion

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.120 
barriers you know like in the invasion
after<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.179> get<00:01:33.899> one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.139> the<00:01:34.229> objectives<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
after you get one of the objectives it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.919 
after you get one of the objectives it
will<00:01:35.219> shut<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> wall<00:01:35.999> down<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.569> you<00:01:36.630> could<00:01:36.749> move

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
will shut a wall down and you could move

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.989 
will shut a wall down and you could move
on<00:01:37.109> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.319> next<00:01:37.530> objective<00:01:37.649> uh<00:01:38.009> these<00:01:38.850> are

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
on to the next objective uh these are

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.300 
on to the next objective uh these are
two<00:01:39.479> series<00:01:39.959> of<00:01:40.399> objective<00:01:41.399> markers<00:01:42.200> that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
two series of objective markers that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.769 
two series of objective markers that
okay<00:01:44.310> here's<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> first<00:01:45.539> spawn

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
okay here's what this is a first spawn

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:46.969 
okay here's what this is a first spawn
point<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.499> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.679> spawn<00:01:46.950> point

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
point this is going to be a spawn point

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
point this is going to be a spawn point
these<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.789> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.029> be<00:01:48.149> both<00:01:48.359> objectives<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
these are going to be both objectives so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.419 
these are going to be both objectives so
you<00:01:49.319> can<00:01:49.469> capture<00:01:49.799> either<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.279> of<00:01:50.310> these

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
you can capture either one of these

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.010 
you can capture either one of these
objectives<00:01:50.819> it<00:01:51.209> will<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.539> this<00:01:51.719> wall<00:01:51.990> down

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
objectives it will take this wall down

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
objectives it will take this wall down
and<00:01:52.529> then<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.249> can<00:01:53.279> get<00:01:53.520> over<00:01:53.819> in<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.209> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and then we can get over in here and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
and then we can get over in here and
you'll<00:01:55.109> capture<00:01:55.369> one<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.429> these<00:01:56.549> two

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you'll capture one of these two

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.209 
you'll capture one of these two
objectives<00:01:56.819> it'll<00:01:57.539> take<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.810> wall<00:01:58.049> down

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
objectives it'll take this wall down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.580 
objectives it'll take this wall down
this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.539> it's<00:02:00.539> called<00:02:00.689> flag<00:02:00.959> stand<00:02:01.289> it's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this is a it's called flag stand it's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.300 
this is a it's called flag stand it's
underneath<00:02:02.299> objectives<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:05.009> our<00:02:05.159> hill

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
underneath objectives like like our hill

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.900 
underneath objectives like like our hill
markers<00:02:05.639> are<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> will<00:02:08.160> spawn<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> core

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
markers are and this will spawn a core

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
markers are and this will spawn a core
and<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.690> last<00:02:10.050> hill<00:02:10.319> marker<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.950> where<00:02:11.190> we're

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and this last hill marker is where we're

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.140 
and this last hill marker is where we're
going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.490> need<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:13.340> deliver<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.520> core<00:02:14.730> for

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to need to deliver the core for

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.009 
going to need to deliver the core for
victory<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:17.599> can<00:02:18.599> be<00:02:18.720> an<00:02:18.810> air

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
victory and this can it's can be an air

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.110 
victory and this can it's can be an air
you<00:02:19.530> could<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.799> like<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> falcon<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.790> i'm<00:02:21.000> guy

like<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:32.950> an<00:05:33.010> objective<00:05:33.460> where<00:05:33.640> you<00:05:33.730> need<00:05:33.910> to

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
like it's an objective where you need to

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.920 
like it's an objective where you need to
take<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:34.920> if<00:05:35.920> I<00:05:36.100> put<00:05:36.370> this<00:05:36.670> on<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.420> blast<00:05:37.660> spawn

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
take so if I put this on the blast spawn

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.330 
take so if I put this on the blast spawn
sequence<00:05:38.350> if<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.500> put<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:38.770> back<00:05:38.890> there<00:05:39.100> then

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
sequence if I put it back there then

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.190 
sequence if I put it back there then
there<00:05:40.150> have<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.390> be<00:05:40.480> another<00:05:40.690> core<00:05:40.930> that<00:05:41.080> needs

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
there have to be another core that needs

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.260 
there have to be another core that needs
to<00:05:41.290> be<00:05:41.350> taken<00:05:41.740> but<00:05:41.950> since<00:05:42.790> it's<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.030> spawn

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
to be taken but since it's the spawn

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.990 
to be taken but since it's the spawn
sequence<00:05:43.660> 3<00:05:44.020> there's<00:05:44.350> a<00:05:44.380> both<00:05:44.590> 3<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:45.700> for<00:05:45.940> the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
sequence 3 there's a both 3 and for the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.050 
sequence 3 there's a both 3 and for the
blue<00:05:46.150> team<00:05:46.330> they're<00:05:46.630> going<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:47.140> be<00:05:48.060> connected

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
blue team they're going to be connected

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.020 
blue team they're going to be connected
so<00:05:49.660> to<00:05:49.750> speak<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:51.520> I'm<00:05:51.640> going<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.790> save<00:05:51.910> this

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
so to speak so I'm going to save this

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.310 
so to speak so I'm going to save this
map<00:05:52.210> again<00:05:52.450> and<00:05:52.570> I'm<00:05:52.630> gonna<00:05:52.780> load<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.050> up<00:05:53.140> in<00:05:53.260> a

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
map again and I'm gonna load it up in a

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.810 
map again and I'm gonna load it up in a
custom<00:05:53.620> game

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.940 

ok<00:05:57.820> so<00:05:57.880> we're<00:05:58.330> loading<00:05:58.480> up<00:05:58.660> a<00:05:58.870> this<00:05:59.800> is<00:05:59.919> a

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
ok so we're loading up a this is a

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.560 
ok so we're loading up a this is a
custom<00:06:00.490> game<00:06:00.610> lobby<00:06:00.820> we're<00:06:01.030> no<00:06:01.120> longer<00:06:01.330> and

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
custom game lobby we're no longer and

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.219 
custom game lobby we're no longer and
for<00:06:01.720> oh<00:06:01.780> wait<00:06:02.200> back<00:06:02.440> out<00:06:03.479> gonna<00:06:04.479> go<00:06:04.840> blue<00:06:05.020> team

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
for oh wait back out gonna go blue team

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.650 
for oh wait back out gonna go blue team
because<00:06:05.590> that's<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.880> invading<00:06:07.300> team<00:06:07.479> and

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
because that's the invading team and

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.810 
because that's the invading team and
it's<00:06:07.750> easier<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.140> demonstrate<00:06:08.260> if<00:06:08.820> I'm

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
it's easier to demonstrate if I'm

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.120 
it's easier to demonstrate if I'm
invading<00:06:10.720> actually<00:06:11.820> but<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:14.010> I'm<00:06:15.010> not

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
invading actually but so I'm not

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.909 
invading actually but so I'm not
entirely<00:06:15.430> sure<00:06:16.290> this<00:06:17.290> is<00:06:17.410> actually<00:06:17.740> going<00:06:17.830> to

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
entirely sure this is actually going to

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:28.900 
entirely sure this is actually going to
work

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.410 

okay<00:06:29.910> so<00:06:30.110> yes<00:06:31.110> we<00:06:31.380> are<00:06:31.530> capturing<00:06:32.400> two<00:06:32.910> it's

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
okay so yes we are capturing two it's

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.150 
okay so yes we are capturing two it's
one<00:06:33.480> it's<00:06:33.690> one<00:06:33.870> of<00:06:34.080> us<00:06:34.320> to<00:06:34.560> go<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:34.890> one<00:06:35.010> of<00:06:35.100> those

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
one it's one of us to go to one of those

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.950 
one it's one of us to go to one of those
objectives<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.210> timer<00:06:36.420> will<00:06:36.570> run<00:06:36.780> down

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
objectives and the timer will run down

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.790 
objectives and the timer will run down
and<00:06:37.370> after<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:39.000> timer<00:06:39.210> runs<00:06:39.480> down<00:06:39.800> cool

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
and after the timer runs down cool

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.220 
and after the timer runs down cool
little<00:06:40.920> noise<00:06:41.160> but<00:06:41.690> after<00:06:42.690> the<00:06:42.780> timer<00:06:42.960> runs

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
little noise but after the timer runs

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.880 
little noise but after the timer runs
down<00:06:45.170> the<00:06:46.520> dot<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:48.780> grid<00:06:49.050> will<00:06:49.230> disappear<00:06:49.680> and

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
down the dot the grid will disappear and

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.140 
down the dot the grid will disappear and
will<00:06:50.070> let<00:06:50.250> us<00:06:50.340> move<00:06:50.520> on<00:06:50.730> to<00:06:50.880> our<00:06:50.910> next

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
will let us move on to our next

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.780 
will let us move on to our next
objective<00:06:52.130> sorry<00:06:53.130> a<00:06:53.160> little<00:06:53.280> slip<00:06:53.520> the<00:06:53.610> tongue

objective sorry a little slip the tongue

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.610 
objective sorry a little slip the tongue
um<00:06:54.030> another<00:06:54.570> couple<00:06:55.200> things<00:06:55.320> I<00:06:55.410> wanna<00:06:55.530> talk

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
um another couple things I wanna talk

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.320 
um another couple things I wanna talk
about<00:06:55.770> is<00:06:55.980> uh<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.340> never<00:06:56.430> actually<00:06:56.760> changed<00:06:57.210> the

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
about is uh I never actually changed the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.750 
about is uh I never actually changed the
objective<00:06:57.780> on<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:57.960> second<00:06:58.260> gate<00:06:58.380> so<00:06:58.760> in

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
objective on the second gate so in

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.550 
objective on the second gate so in
between<00:07:00.090> cuts<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.540> went<00:07:00.900> in<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.110> fixed<00:07:01.440> that

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
between cuts I went in and fixed that

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.440 
between cuts I went in and fixed that
this<00:07:02.280> is<00:07:02.460> this<00:07:02.669> could<00:07:02.850> be<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.000> lot<00:07:03.270> more

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
this is this could be a lot more

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.120 
this is this could be a lot more
complicated<00:07:03.720> you<00:07:04.320> don't<00:07:04.500> need<00:07:04.620> to<00:07:04.680> use<00:07:04.860> like

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
complicated you don't need to use like

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.540 
complicated you don't need to use like
grids<00:07:05.490> or<00:07:05.730> shields<00:07:06.150> for<00:07:06.330> walls<00:07:06.570> and<00:07:07.460> one<00:07:08.460> of

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
grids or shields for walls and one of

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.400 
grids or shields for walls and one of
the<00:07:08.640> objectives<00:07:09.180> could<00:07:09.419> be<00:07:09.600> anything<00:07:10.140> it

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
the objectives could be anything it

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.490 
the objectives could be anything it
could<00:07:10.470> be<00:07:10.530> a<00:07:10.620> gun<00:07:11.280> it<00:07:11.760> could<00:07:11.880> be<00:07:12.030> a<00:07:12.360> box<00:07:13.350> it

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
could be a gun it could be a box it

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.290 
could be a gun it could be a box it
could<00:07:13.560> be<00:07:13.710> a<00:07:13.740> dice<00:07:14.130> it<00:07:14.430> could<00:07:14.550> be<00:07:14.640> a<00:07:14.669> golf<00:07:15.030> ball

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
could be a dice it could be a golf ball

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.740 
could be a dice it could be a golf ball
and<00:07:15.510> you<00:07:15.780> could<00:07:15.930> push<00:07:16.110> it<00:07:16.140> around<00:07:16.320> and

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
and you could push it around and

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.640 
and you could push it around and
theoretically<00:07:18.750> you<00:07:18.810> would<00:07:18.990> move<00:07:19.169> where<00:07:19.500> you

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
theoretically you would move where you

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.370 
theoretically you would move where you
have<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:19.950> capture<00:07:20.460> so<00:07:20.880> just<00:07:21.480> swallow<00:07:21.780> down<00:07:22.050> the

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
have to capture so just swallow down the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.350 
have to capture so just swallow down the
capture<00:07:22.650> there<00:07:23.340> that<00:07:23.490> cores<00:07:23.790> up<00:07:24.030> and<00:07:24.270> I'm

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
capture there that cores up and I'm

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.760 
capture there that cores up and I'm
gonna<00:07:24.480> pick<00:07:24.720> it<00:07:24.750> up<00:07:24.900> and<00:07:24.960> I'm<00:07:25.230> gonna<00:07:25.350> take<00:07:25.560> a<00:07:25.710> to

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
gonna pick it up and I'm gonna take a to

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.720 
gonna pick it up and I'm gonna take a to
the<00:07:26.730> objective<00:07:27.180> and<00:07:27.800> that's<00:07:28.800> the<00:07:28.980> basics<00:07:29.490> of

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730 
the objective and that's the basics of

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.630 
the objective and that's the basics of
how<00:07:30.150> to<00:07:30.300> forge<00:07:30.630> a<00:07:31.470> invasion<00:07:32.040> map<00:07:32.250> it<00:07:32.460> took<00:07:32.610> a

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640 
how to forge a invasion map it took a

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.600 
how to forge a invasion map it took a
lot<00:07:33.390> of<00:07:33.510> experience<00:07:35.750> experimentation<00:07:36.750> to

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
lot of experience experimentation to

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.830 
lot of experience experimentation to
figure<00:07:38.610> out<00:07:38.729> exactly<00:07:38.880> what<00:07:39.300> I<00:07:39.330> needed<00:07:39.510> to<00:07:39.660> do

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
figure out exactly what I needed to do

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.370 
figure out exactly what I needed to do
but<00:07:40.940> this<00:07:41.940> is<00:07:42.090> pretty<00:07:42.300> much<00:07:42.450> this<00:07:42.660> the<00:07:43.050> easiest

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
but this is pretty much this the easiest

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.440 
but this is pretty much this the easiest
