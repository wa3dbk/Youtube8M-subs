looks<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.739> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.099> tacky<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.580> don't<00:02:14.790> know

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
looks a little bit tacky I don't know

know it's anyway the main thing is this
lights<00:02:18.870> work<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.400> did<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.110> string

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
lights work so what I did was I string

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.259 
lights work so what I did was I string
strung<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> lights<00:02:22.860> together<00:02:23.269> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
strung all the lights together and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.930 
strung all the lights together and
connected<00:02:24.780> them<00:02:25.010> drill<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> hole<00:02:26.340> under<00:02:26.700> the

third brake light ran him in through the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.190 
third brake light ran him in through the
headliner<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.950> down<00:02:29.220> into<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> cab<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.930> I'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
headliner and down into the cab and I'll

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.449 
headliner and down into the cab and I'll
show<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.470> where<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.709> mounted<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.040> toggle

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
show you where I mounted the toggle

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.170 

now<00:02:39.230> today<00:02:39.440> right<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.180> storage

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
now today right here in the storage

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.690 
now today right here in the storage
Department<00:02:41.780> area<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.320> also<00:02:42.830> used<00:02:43.340> some<00:02:43.400> wire

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
Department area I also used some wire

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.910 
Department area I also used some wire
wrapping<00:02:44.030> here<00:02:44.570> drill<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.470> hole<00:02:45.620> through<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
wrapping here drill the hole through the

wrapping here drill the hole through the
back<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.280> storage<00:02:46.640> area<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.220> random<00:02:49.960> ran

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
back of the storage area and random ran

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.540 
back of the storage area and random ran
it<00:02:51.080> out<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.380> relay<00:02:51.710> into<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> battery<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
it out to the relay into the battery and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.450 
it out to the relay into the battery and
everything<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.830> Casey's<00:02:54.830> pretty<00:02:55.040> good<00:02:55.220> about

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
everything so Casey's pretty good about

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.660 
everything so Casey's pretty good about
this<00:02:55.640> stuff<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.740> really<00:02:58.100> nice<00:02:58.220> LED

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
with the way the trucks turning out it's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.280 
with the way the trucks turning out it's
there's<00:03:33.940> nothing<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.810> I've<00:03:35.020> seen

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
there's nothing like it that I've seen

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.200

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
in real light the only thing that I can

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.030 
in real light the only thing that I can
think<00:03:37.240> of<00:03:37.480> close<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:38.020> being<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.740> struck

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
think of close to being like the struck

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.030 
think of close to being like the struck
is<00:03:39.310> uh<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:40.570> some<00:03:41.230> old-school<00:03:41.470> four-wheel

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
is uh in some old-school four-wheel

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590 
is uh in some old-school four-wheel
drive<00:03:42.310> magazines<00:03:42.820> my<00:03:42.970> dad<00:03:43.120> gave<00:03:43.360> me<00:03:43.420> that

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
drive magazines my dad gave me that

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.240 
drive magazines my dad gave me that
we're<00:03:43.810> from<00:03:43.990> 97<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:44.890> what<00:03:45.010> gave<00:03:45.130> me<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
we're from 97 that's what gave me the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.230 
we're from 97 that's what gave me the
idea<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.470> turned<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.860> very

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
idea to do this and it turned out very

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.670 
idea to do this and it turned out very
very<00:03:49.240> good<00:03:49.480> so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.470 

anyway<00:03:54.370> like<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.640> said<00:03:54.849> that's<00:03:54.970> about<00:03:55.209> all<00:03:55.360> I've

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
that'll be it and then I'll be done with

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.990 
that'll be it and then I'll be done with
the<00:04:05.319> truck<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.980> guys<00:04:09.159> for<00:04:09.489> watching<00:04:09.640> this
