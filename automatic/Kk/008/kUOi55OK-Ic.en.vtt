gonna hook it up but I'll show you what

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.090 
gonna hook it up but I'll show you what
I've<00:01:16.030> done<00:01:16.140> ok<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.200> first<00:01:17.500> things<00:01:17.770> first<00:01:17.829> you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
I've done ok so first things first you

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.730 
I've done ok so first things first you
got<00:01:18.280> your<00:01:18.310> solar<00:01:18.609> panel<00:01:18.939> on<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.359> Sun<00:01:19.619> look<00:01:20.619> it

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
got your solar panel on the Sun look it

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.429 
got your solar panel on the Sun look it
in<00:01:20.859> here<00:01:21.100> it's<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.310> solar<00:01:21.579> input<00:01:21.899> so<00:01:22.899> now<00:01:23.229> if<00:01:23.409> we

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
in here it's a solar input so now if we

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.730 
in here it's a solar input so now if we
were<00:01:23.619> actually<00:01:23.740> in<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.159> room<00:01:24.340> where<00:01:24.490> there<00:01:24.640> was

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
were actually in a room where there was

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.249 
were actually in a room where there was
any<00:01:26.740> light<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.789> would<00:01:27.880> see<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.329> solar<00:01:28.899> charge

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
any light we would see the solar charge

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.230 
any light we would see the solar charge
battery<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.280> we'd<00:01:30.460> see<00:01:30.609> we<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> solar

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
battery and we'd see we see the solar

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.499 
battery and we'd see we see the solar
charge<00:01:31.479> light<00:01:31.719> up<00:01:32.039> but<00:01:33.039> so<00:01:33.640> since<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:34.450> not

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
charge light up but so since it's not

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.359 
charge light up but so since it's not
really<00:01:34.570> collecting<00:01:35.500> anything<00:01:35.740> because<00:01:36.219> we're

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
really collecting anything because we're

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.480 
really collecting anything because we're
in<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.609> room<00:01:37.240> with<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.630> little<00:01:37.719> bit<00:01:37.960> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
in a room with a little bit of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.700 
in a room with a little bit of
incandescent<00:01:39.490> light<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.289> can<00:01:41.500> do

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
incandescent light what you can do

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.929 
incandescent light what you can do
actually<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.429> can<00:01:42.549> take<00:01:42.670> one<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.850> these

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
actually is you can take one of these

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
actually is you can take one of these
jacks<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.570> put<00:01:43.719> on<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.840> bigger<00:01:44.350> power<00:01:44.590> powerful

jacks<00:02:01.450> are<00:02:01.689> six<00:02:02.380> volts<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:03.249> you<00:02:03.340> can<00:02:03.490> actually

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
jacks are six volts so you can actually

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.120 
jacks are six volts so you can actually
turn<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.179> main<00:02:04.329> power<00:02:04.569> switch

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
there's no load right here because we're

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.420 
there's no load right here because we're
actually<00:02:11.290> determining<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.040> wanted<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
actually determining if I wanted to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.970 
actually determining if I wanted to
charge<00:02:12.670> my<00:02:12.820> cell<00:02:12.880> phone<00:02:13.270> if<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.200> had<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> right

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
what I would be doing is I would be

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.030 
what I would be doing is I would be
putting<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.569> here<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.470> Sun<00:02:17.709> out<00:02:17.920> in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
putting it in here out in the Sun out in

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
putting it in here out in the Sun out in
the<00:02:18.099> middle<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.550> nowhere<00:02:18.870> charging<00:02:19.870> my<00:02:19.989> cell
