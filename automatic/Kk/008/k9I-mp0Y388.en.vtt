00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
into mounds and then we're going to make

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.320 
into mounds and then we're going to make
two<00:01:36.170> strips<00:01:36.710> now<00:01:37.520> what<00:01:37.640> I'm<00:01:37.760> doing<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:38.270> is

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
two strips now what I'm doing here is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.580 
two strips now what I'm doing here is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.520 
until they're golden brown bake them and
maybe<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.280> second<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> highest<00:01:59.240> rack<00:01:59.530> so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
maybe the second to the highest rack so

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.440 
maybe the second to the highest rack so
now<00:02:00.710> we've<00:02:00.890> taken<00:02:01.160> our<00:02:01.490> biscotti<00:02:01.700> out<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
now we've taken our biscotti out of the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.960 
now we've taken our biscotti out of the
oven<00:02:02.600> we've<00:02:03.440> let<00:02:03.590> them<00:02:03.770> cool<00:02:04.040> for<00:02:04.340> 30<00:02:04.550> minutes

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
oven we've let them cool for 30 minutes

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.480 
oven we've let them cool for 30 minutes
and<00:02:05.300> I've<00:02:06.140> also<00:02:06.470> reduced<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.190> oven

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and I've also reduced the oven

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.910 
and I've also reduced the oven
temperature<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.940> 325<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:09.530> when<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.740> put

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
temperature to 325 because when you put

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.890 
temperature to 325 because when you put
them<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.460> second<00:02:10.940> bake<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.660> at<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
them in for that second bake that's at a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.780 
them in for that second bake that's at a
lower<00:02:12.140> temperature<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.430> remove<00:02:13.640> them

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
lower temperature and I just remove them

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.060 
lower temperature and I just remove them
from<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.090> pan<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> Silpat<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.920> gonna

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
from the pan on the Silpat we gonna

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.800 
from the pan on the Silpat we gonna
transfer<00:02:16.400> them<00:02:16.489> onto<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.850> cutting<00:02:17.090> surface<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
transfer them onto a cutting surface and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.449 
transfer them onto a cutting surface and
then<00:02:18.260> what<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> sharp

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
then what we can do is with a sharp

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.940 
then what we can do is with a sharp
serrated<00:02:19.790> knife<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:20.959> cuts<00:02:21.440> straight

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
serrated knife just make cuts straight

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.090 
serrated knife just make cuts straight
down<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.430> them<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.760> way<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.830> see

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
down in them this way and so you can see

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.340 
down in them this way and so you can see
this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.000> looks<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.810> risk<00:02:26.959> LT<00:02:27.230> that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
this is looks just like the risk LT that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.380 
this is looks just like the risk LT that
you<00:02:27.410> buy<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.950> store<00:02:28.370> except<00:02:29.060> hopefully<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you buy in the store except hopefully it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.970 
you buy in the store except hopefully it
will<00:02:29.480> taste<00:02:29.690> better<00:02:29.900> we're<00:02:30.500> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.739> bake

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
will taste better we're going to bake

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.870 
will taste better we're going to bake
