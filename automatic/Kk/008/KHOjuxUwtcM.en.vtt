00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.789
 love all cases it's not our style 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.279
 the french community manager of the gunners two hours 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 we had remained stable for study presented during 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.199
 Hello everyone 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.880
 but guy arcizet a is a mayor did not see motorcycle other Kanak extras 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.979
 the parents of six children 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.970
 this is the next chapter in chapter in the history of the tour in singles 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 so it's a persistent melo embarrassment in which people live in 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.500
 the universe of huge 150 years after what happened in the trilogy 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 original 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 that people can still 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.010
 the challenge today 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 it was a day without 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.269
 it is a very beautiful 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.340
 in the case of Islamists who is normal in working 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 very dynamic with a whole lot of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 it must then be denied are 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 truly innovative as the personal story 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 who will be elected a story that both players will be able to experience at their 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.290
 own speed with afp 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.940
 the deep feeling 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020
 it will have a whole lot of dynamic events in the world these are the 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.880
 players will meet to fight 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.320
 and situations 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 they change according to what people are doing that will impact 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.050
 that the world of the living without facing dijon 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.400
 it will really be the multiplayer winter everyone is playing together we hope 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.490
 that people are really going 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.539
 lots of fun and art he appreciates the best-selling artistic rendering 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.820
 it's something that we 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 on which we count enormously 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 but let's just talk about 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.200
 of events% and dynamic here is the video of the manifesto and me at a time 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 given in confiscation 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 see how it goes at the stop under construction under her dress 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 not directly here is a novel reconstruction little by little 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.010
 if you are more than 20 years of exile put his veto along the two new 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.040
 structures that are in the world so when we look for example will 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.780
 more than uncertain 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 it's something that has been put in place the tax in time 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 the centaurs on them 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.430
 attack that part and that's it 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.170
 to make sure that the village is from earlier 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.130
 so that's things that were being put in place in the environment 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.200
 that the players will see the players have done however we expect some 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 pact according to the events 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.709
 we actually have construction and dirt talk about 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.129
 non-player characters 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.989
 the same day we can not come back to repair the bridge 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.520
 which proves his sales revenue only protected 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.169
 non-player characters 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.979
 teheran repelling the mobs attacks around this stuff that we can 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.899
 pretend text was created in the event one is not fair 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.219
 spectators the players at apax request 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.350
 e but still 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.789
 not to act or not with some of its elements 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.279
 events 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.889
 our hearts in the demo had introduced you to the dull recovery 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.369
 we had announced to you once again invented the necromancer 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:43.440
 a little further 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.139
 we tell each other this particularity 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.219
 especially what are the differences like for example 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.029
 actually the metro man is one of the surprises we have reserved for players 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:52.939
 who 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.539
 who decides and who also look at us all over the world 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.699
 once again simple 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.469
 we kept the same name because it's a lighthouse character takes huge 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.829
 sicard teacher of 40 years enormously 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.499
 and what was in time 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.379
 finally Sunday 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.249
 and more 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.159
 he will for example have servants in the same way that they had to 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.519
 he lingers 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.230
 will soon prove to be beneficial so he will however have a 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.129
 servant tool will serve with allied powers 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.419
 to the sleeve to death also to life 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.679
 things in hand 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.069
 recover the rats 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.449
 the lives of others 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.329
 the way of life 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.040
 it puts 400 game mechanics not very focused around these elements that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.360
 make necromancer 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.299
 the profession 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 kelleher and give him this man this particular blow 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.299
 the visual effects they are relatively 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.489
 e well done 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.539
 I do not know if you could have looked but 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.889
 there were some things that are very very very very awesome at 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.909
 see torrents see 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.689
 otherwise at the% pvp level 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.240
 how is it going to happen at the level of 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.939
 eight servers against servers 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.179
 how many people to accommodate about 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.429
 we do not have exact numbers because these things are 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.579
 we are experimenting and have chosen 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.609
 what we said since your debut will stop fighting screen 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.909
 we hope to equip according to the context 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.200
 so there will be hundreds of Chinese he frequently missed hundreds of 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.889
 players 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.749
 it will be 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.870
 not only something that will be important in terms of taste 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.280
 a lot of players but also the more we had three servers in one 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.249
 fight 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.249
 it's also something that will play a little bit to have some impact 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.759
 we also said that 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.979
 we will limit the amount of movement between the server what kind of things so 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.159
 there are little total small details that we 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.449
 photo we will talk more 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.740
 we will have all the information 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.710
 but if not at the level of the distribution of servers how will it go 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.999
 it's going to be a bit like the one of the raise will be different 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
 500 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.710
 a little bit in satin that's how the same thing that will require 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.259
 a lot of things 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.849
 be put in place when we do not speak for now but who will do 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.199
 than 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.090
 people will make wills be able to create between world is called 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.800
 it shows that servers 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.600
 because yes 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240
 in an atmosphere of two families 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.529
 friendly atmosphere different servants underground place d'armes 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.789
 I imagine community policy 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.789
 of the atmosphere and the environment that prefers 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.039
 the community is something very dynamic years 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.770
 and we realized we're all people we'll see what 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.689
 I think I'm here 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.499
 otherwise since the balance of the end 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.110
 - even without subscription 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.319
 how's it going at the high school launch level you're going to have percent of 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.319
 micro-transaction people like flower sales costume the child 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.309
 the model the economic model that you have to buy 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:38.930
 and he is an extension 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.289
 if the act all we did in two or three years 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.979
 which is said in passing from the Buddha who has evolved little by little 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:45.990
 five years of life 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.589
 of divorce today 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.789
 so it will be and it is very important to remind him 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.379
 mmo without subscription 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.719
 we will have bought the box and after we can play all the time we want 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.900
 and then to miss micro-transactions of the shrink 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.629
 costumes as we see it today 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.270
 other things that players are already used to 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.569
 flag head novelties 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.069
 all players preferring a fine of my weight 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.240
 she we all have these details her debt 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.449
 the train station otherwise well finished 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.189
 how did that happen 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.229
 his rise to become a major committee face overflows 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.969
 it's inhuman what's interesting because I was already a fan of 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.029
 point 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.649
 I say in a certain way in what I'm doing today it's the 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.860
 continuation of what I was lining up the few months already 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.279
 so 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.839
 I had the chance and opportunity to be able to a power enter the 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.650
 process 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.710
 an interview with afp with the company had manhattan 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.710
 because the genocide of skills that allowed for 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.309
 we can say that I'm a good community manager I wanted 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.270
 maybe as team manager for this community 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.069
 this committee that I like 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.339
 it's sassy 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.050
 which is very very interesting 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.199
 which is very diverse 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.439
 how I am I came so far it is that these practices 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.330
 are relatively complicated 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.580
 Jacques Chirac a little more explained in the interview for origin a ring 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.330
 but roughly speaking 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.580
 it was something very natural 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.430
 and I am extremely happy to be here today and to continue 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.339
 for a long time 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.679
 karma very well thank you stéphane and then% to very soon its origin 

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:17.919
