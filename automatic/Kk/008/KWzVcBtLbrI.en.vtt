00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 and 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.610
 and 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 very well then let's review 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.280
 deadlift sumo with dumbbells this is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.250
 a great exercise to work the part 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.500
 posterior thighs all our 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.060
 hamstrings and I also consider that it is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.050
 the best way to learn how to make a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.030
 dead weight 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.980
 remember that the weight shows the technique 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.930
 that we must use to lift 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.190
 any heavy object so it's a 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.989
 exercise that we are used to rolling 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.239
 everyday for it I will separate the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.829
 feet in this case wider than my 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 shoulders the tips of the feet 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.629
 slightly outward this will help 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.870
 work the leg translators 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.570
 and we are going to take the implement we are going to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.550
 lower the hip back straight remember 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.589
 which is dead weight so no it is not 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.570
 squat with the back totally 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.180
 vertical if not done let's fall a little 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.060
 back straight back and head a 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.360
 little forward there I'm going to upload everything 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 the weight with the muscles 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.390
 extenders in my hip of the next 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 shape 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.079
 The key points of the exercise are in 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.850
 lower our hips since what 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.039
 let's use the back of this 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.409
 straight chest out shoulders 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.880
 slightly back and that's where 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.880
 we made the whole movement 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.300
 as you can see this exercise loves 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.540
 dead prisoners smoke since we raise a 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.270
 deadweight and also the technique is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.030
 It looks a lot like a sumo wrestler 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.790
 precisely 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.470
 for example of what we should not do 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.570
 Remember to flex your hips 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.040
 time to go down to carry all the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 forces the musculature of the part 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.970
 back of the legs and back 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.970
 straight throughout the movement 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.769
 and 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.489
 what 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.489
 and
