00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
would you take someone with you or would

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.620 
would you take someone with you or would
you<00:04:28.900> go<00:04:29.230> alone<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.520> definitely<00:04:31.000> take

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
you go alone so I definitely take

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.900

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
someone with me and I would probably

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.810 
someone with me and I would probably
take<00:04:34.660> my<00:04:35.440> sister<00:04:35.740> Megan<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.310> just<00:04:36.430> because<00:04:36.700> we

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
take my sister Megan and just because we

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.640 
take my sister Megan and just because we
have<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.030> much<00:04:37.150> fun<00:04:37.390> together<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:38.590> think

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
have so much fun together and I think

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.700 
have so much fun together and I think
that<00:04:39.040> would<00:04:39.130> be<00:04:39.340> amazing<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.870> think<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.560> would

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that would be amazing I think I would

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.380 
that would be amazing I think I would
get<00:04:41.800> really<00:04:41.950> bored<00:04:42.280> if<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.520> went<00:04:42.670> by<00:04:42.820> myself<00:04:42.850> and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
get really bored if I went by myself and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.360 
get really bored if I went by myself and
like<00:04:43.510> really<00:04:43.720> lonely<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.740> also<00:04:44.919> probably

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
like really lonely but it also probably

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.650 
like really lonely but it also probably
still<00:04:45.550> be<00:04:45.580> funds<00:04:45.850> i'd<00:04:45.970> probably<00:04:46.150> like<00:04:46.360> meet

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
people along the way but i think i would

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.330
