going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.770> reviewing<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
going to be reviewing it is because I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.840 
going to be reviewing it is because I
have<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.530> problems<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.190> problems

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
have some problems with it not problems

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.540 
have some problems with it not problems
but<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.750> things<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.050> would<00:00:40.110> change<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.920> stuff

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
but some things I would change and stuff

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
but some things I would change and stuff
like<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.739> things<00:00:43.950> first

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
like that so the first things first

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
like that so the first things first
it's<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> Revlon<00:00:45.059> crimper<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.469> called

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it's a Revlon crimper and it's called

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.439 
it's a Revlon crimper and it's called
like<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> jumbo<00:00:47.430> crimper<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> believe<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.250> it

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
like a jumbo crimper I believe and it

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
like a jumbo crimper I believe and it
stays<00:00:51.449> open<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.920> goes<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> 30<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
stays open like this it goes up to 30 I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.689 
stays open like this it goes up to 30 I
don't<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:55.020> temperature<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
don't know what temperature that is and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
don't know what temperature that is and
Fahrenheit<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.449> Celsius<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
Fahrenheit or Celsius but it goes up to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.720 
Fahrenheit or Celsius but it goes up to
30<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.760> has<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.000> on/off<00:01:00.359> button<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.730> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
30 and just has an on/off button and it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
30 and just has an on/off button and it
crimps<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
crimps really well I really do like it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
crimps really well I really do like it
it<00:01:05.250> has<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it has this little thing here so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.170 
it has this little thing here so
probably<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:08.040> storing<00:01:08.460> reasons<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> stuff

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
probably for storing reasons and stuff

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
probably for storing reasons and stuff
like<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.860> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
like that it has this little thing that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.750 
like that it has this little thing that
you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.280> hold<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> attach<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you can hold this down and attach that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
you can hold this down and attach that
to<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> closed<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.250> nice

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to so it's closed which is kind of nice

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.109 
to so it's closed which is kind of nice
a<00:01:17.700> problem<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.909> like<00:01:20.909> how

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a problem I have with this is like how

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
a problem I have with this is like how
are<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> supposed<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> able<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
are you supposed to able to just hold it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.789 
are you supposed to able to just hold it
like<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.369> when<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.090> heating<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.570> because

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
like this when it's heating up because

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
like this when it's heating up because
there's<00:01:25.799> nowhere<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
there's nowhere to put it down like I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
there's nowhere to put it down like I
don't<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.780> tried<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> pulls<00:01:29.820> out

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
don't I tried to see if this pulls out

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
don't I tried to see if this pulls out
or<00:01:30.329> something<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> mean<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
or something like that but I mean I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.870 
or something like that but I mean I
guess<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.460> okay

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
guess it's okay

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.670 
guess it's okay
there's<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.570> Ridge<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:33.900> these

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there's this little Ridge here these

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
there's this little Ridge here these
little<00:01:35.009> ridges<00:01:37.100> see<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> guess<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
little ridges see here but I guess you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.920 
little ridges see here but I guess you
could<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.340> stay<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.150> off<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
could it would stay you know off the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
could it would stay you know off the
countertop<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.579> like

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
countertop if you just put it on like

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
countertop if you just put it on like
that<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> wish<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> had<00:01:46.170> something<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that but I wish it had something that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.069 
that but I wish it had something that
you<00:01:46.770> could<00:01:46.920> rest<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.540> while<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you could rest it on you know while you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
you could rest it on you know while you
were<00:01:49.200> waiting<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> had

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
were waiting for it because what I had

for<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.190> another<00:02:08.640> thing<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.509> thing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
for it another thing is like this thing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.619 
for it another thing is like this thing
gets<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.280> hot<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.879> don't<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.390> why

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
gets really really hot I don't know why

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.490 
gets really really hot I don't know why
the<00:02:12.690> outside

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the outside

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
the outside
has<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.710> get<00:02:13.890> hot<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.460> maybe<00:02:14.760> they<00:02:14.970> should

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
has to get hot I think maybe they should

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.340 
has to get hot I think maybe they should
have<00:02:15.210> covered<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.720> or<00:02:15.870> something<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
have covered it or something like that

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.160 
have covered it or something like that
because<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.400> gets<00:02:17.700> really<00:02:18.180> hot<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.750> got<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.050> be

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
because it gets really hot you got to be

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.680 
because it gets really hot you got to be
really<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.680> careful<00:02:20.060> not<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.540> burn

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
really really careful not to burn

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.080 
really really careful not to burn
yourself<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.650> did<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.130> when

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
yourself because I think I did like when

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.150 
yourself because I think I did like when
I<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.330> doing<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:25.380> these<00:02:25.650> parts<00:02:26.040> obviously

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I was doing it not these parts obviously

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
I was doing it not these parts obviously
but<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.120> bottom<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.600> back<00:02:27.750> part<00:02:28.020> right

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
but like the bottom the back part right

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.220 
but like the bottom the back part right
here<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.410> think<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:29.550> should<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.390> know<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.780> then

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
here I think it should you know and then

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.320 
here I think it should you know and then
right<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:32.160> part<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.120> should

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
right here this part I think they should

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.930 
right here this part I think they should
make<00:02:33.360> something<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.380> easier<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.280> curl<00:02:35.760> at

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
make something that's easier to curl at

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.550 
make something that's easier to curl at
your<00:02:36.060> roots<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
your roots because you really have to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
your roots because you really have to
maneuver<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.160> make<00:02:38.400> sure<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
maneuver and make sure that it's you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
maneuver and make sure that it's you
know<00:02:39.890> not<00:02:40.890> weird<00:02:41.310> when<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:41.790> doing<00:02:42.060> your

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
know not weird when you're doing your

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.710 
know not weird when you're doing your
when<00:02:42.720> you're<00:02:42.840> crimping<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.350> hair<00:02:44.570> or<00:02:45.570> else

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
when you're crimping your hair or else

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.479 
when you're crimping your hair or else
it<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:45.870> gives<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.709> really<00:02:46.950> ugly<00:02:47.070> dent

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it just gives like a really ugly dent

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.030 
it just gives like a really ugly dent
but<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> my<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.900> tutorials<00:02:49.410> show<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.830> show

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
but like and my my tutorials show I show

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.070 
but like and my my tutorials show I show
that<00:02:50.070> like<00:02:50.580> how<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> kind<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.720> rid<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.959> that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
that like how to kind of get rid of that

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.949 
that like how to kind of get rid of that
but<00:02:52.410> still<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.270> using<00:02:54.570> this

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
but still like when you're using this

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.110 
but still like when you're using this
when<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.410> tip<00:02:55.890> right<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:56.370> touches<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.709> UM

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
when this tip right here touches the UM

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
when this tip right here touches the UM
your<00:03:00.120> hair<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:02.360> creases<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.900> think

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
your hair it just creases it so I think

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.449 
your hair it just creases it so I think
maybe<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.650> should<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:04.920> made<00:03:05.130> something

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
maybe they should have made something

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.300 
maybe they should have made something
that<00:03:05.940> kind<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.830> kind<00:03:08.220> of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that kind of like this like kind of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.160 
that kind of like this like kind of
instead<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.850> going<00:03:09.270> straight<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.020> should

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
instead of going straight up it should

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.320 
instead of going straight up it should
have<00:03:10.340> belted<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.000> kind<00:03:12.150> of

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
have belted like that so it kind of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.720 
have belted like that so it kind of
continued<00:03:12.870> everything<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.190> doesn't<00:03:14.520> it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
continued everything so it doesn't it

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.500 
continued everything so it doesn't it
wouldn't<00:03:15.239> burn<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.600> much<00:03:15.780> much<00:03:17.180> those<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.209> my

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
wouldn't burn you much much those are my

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.080 
wouldn't burn you much much those are my
suggestions<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.500> anyway<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.060> other<00:03:21.060> than

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
suggestions for it anyway so other than

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.759 
suggestions for it anyway so other than
that<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.570> works<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:22.019> good<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> crimps

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
that it works really good it crimps

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.699 
that it works really good it crimps
really<00:03:23.070> well<00:03:23.250> um<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:24.239> seen<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.049> curls

really well um it's seen the curls
stayed<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.370> my<00:03:26.640> extensions<00:03:27.209> for<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.530> I
