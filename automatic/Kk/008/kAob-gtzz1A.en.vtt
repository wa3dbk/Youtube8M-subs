 many of you also to go there 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.540
 so it's nice to share small 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.830
 novelties that haunts my name is everything and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.150
 I did not find the thing level 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.660
 cosmeto and so I come from you in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.070
 speak 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 so I'm going to start with a product 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 either by being dealing will say so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.539
 it's the mark alone will run so it's 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 a British brand and that is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 totally organic and so it's a bottle 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.660
 250 milliliters of a spray for the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 body for very dry skin to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 atopic so everything is safe yasi 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.379
 this eczema the skin irritations and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 it is usable in children of a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.320
 year so the composition as much tell you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.870
 that I ul them and super super good she 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.090
 is really nickel and it's a product 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.530
 who on the site so I went 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 look on the site when coming home 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.809
 me so it's a product worth 32 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 pence so that's about 35 38 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.060
 euros and I paid them 3 euros 50 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.350
 so that's all right so we've got some 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.570
 bought several cans I was with them 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.210
 with my mother so we took one for everything 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.040
 the world so that I can not wait to test and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.570
 I will talk about it again because 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520
 that winter I really tend to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 do a lot of exams 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 so why am I doing a little bit more 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.310
 severe than summer simply because 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.960
 that in the winter I put myself several 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 layers of clothes and in fact sometimes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.100
 it is the friction quite stupidly 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
 clothes on the skin that creates 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.600
 eczema and also periods of stress 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 it can trigger eczema attacks 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 so I'm very happy to have 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.520
 bought this product in +100 very good they 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.520
 are the top plants 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.299
 then I found a mark that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.899
 I like I already told you about 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.970
 this brand 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:57.920
 this is the brand water garden donkeys 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.920
 so this is a brand youn Lyon not 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.990
 so it's a brand that's imported 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.240
 it's made in Morocco but the seat 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.879
 yes is lyon finally right next to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.590
 lyon at 100 this is why 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.989
 I had recorded lyon 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 and so I bought two pots of clay 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.810
 red so the red clay is great 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 good for sensitive skin so that's 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.129
 used to make masks 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.349
 we can put on the hair on the 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.400
 skin can be used for washing 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.410
 really it's the thing to do everything if 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.910
 you want me to make videos 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.290
 there on elsewhere because I had 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.879
 already bought due rassoul of this brand 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.810
 that I love and so there I saw that there 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.140
 had red clay that I would have 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.010
 so took the pot of two hundred and 200 g I 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.900
 the payais one euro what traits 20 19 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.739
 so that's good because that's it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 must cost at least four times more 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.470
 dear I think it has to be sold 8 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.120
 euros the 200 grams something 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 like that so I took 2 po 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.769
 so then to stay in the same 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.370
 Mark 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.349
 I bought vegetable oils but 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.250
 so there by cons huge disappointment I 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.220
 explains why 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.290
 so I buy seed oil 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 of grapes from castor oil and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.900
 wheat germ oil 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.230
 so in fact oil doris years and for 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.519
 grow poufs 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.709
 I excuse and that's one of the reasons 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.910
 it is to grow hair 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.489
 so for those who need thumb 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.840
 hair or also for the eyebrows and 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.510
 for the eyelashes it's really very very 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.769
 effective grape seed oil 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.819
 it is to remove makeup because 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.930
 it's one of the least expensive and he 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.329
 wheat germ 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.030
 it's very interesting in the care 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.260
 for the skin in syria tation all that that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.120
 can really be interesting 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.530
 good then the problem is that I am 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.090
 am saying yeah nice this mark there 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.130
 she's fine I'm buying some clay from 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.709
 rassoul so I did not even look at the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.349
 composition mistake so be careful 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.829
 because in fact in the compositions 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.959
 enki here is the ignoble paraphe 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.120
 soul liquid and so for those who 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.280
 know the para final at the quidam is a 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810
 derived from oil so I do not know what 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.730
 that crazy in vegetable oils 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.340
 so much to tell you that I am a little 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.160
 disgusted but good the 60000 elytron I 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.200
 paid the bottle so 60 mini trip 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.099
 in all sixty thousand liters it costs 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.500
 one euro 60 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.030
 so it's really cheap but good at 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.639
 same time it means that he 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.139
 diluted to either para finish our 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.840
 criteria or so it's a lion I know 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.700
 not why but that's good I'm a little 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.190
 disappointed good for those who do not care 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.120
 it does not matter but we heat that 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.530
 when we throw vegetable oils 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.770
 anyway to do mixtures 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.460
 so we have a little bit of a bit 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.830
 bio anyway 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.330
 and there with affinium bread is a pity 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.450
 I do not know what I'm going to do 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:51.300
 that's maybe no I do not know so 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.400
 good and the suede products so I'm 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.990
 super super super content 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.240
 so this is a product of the brand to 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.710
 caurel so if you do not know to have 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.290
 at caurel I already talked about it he was selling 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.940
 products for hair removal that are 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.740
 really super natural and the brand to 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.140
 caurel golden game for that in fact for 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.700
 for the lakes 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.440
 it's not depilatory cream 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.810
 the depilatory wax with sugar base 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.270
 must also cold bands all done 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.979
 that they are top issime also it is that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.570
 you want me to talk about it again 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.370
 no problem but here I am talking to you 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.050
 of a perfume finally from another canvas is 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 what I do not like the perfume 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.040
 because it's too strong I prefer the 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.560
 poet is lighter evaporates more 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.430
 quickly and so his flowers perfumes of 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.419
 cherry tree and so it's a bottle that 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.060
 made at 50 thousand liters and that cost me 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.320
 4 euros 49 so much to tell you that I 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.789
 I'm really happy I was wearing them yesterday 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.850
 it's really urgent 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.840
 I put both Shiites and that's enough 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.669
 feels too good I'm going to put a little 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.600
 little on the wrist or if I like 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.729
 do that they are really very very good 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.360
 so it's at the composition level 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.010
 talking to him about that so overpacking his 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.350
 written this eau de toilette and 100 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.330
 muscle milk recent foxes without 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.229
 phenoxyethanol by us without dye 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.090
 phthalates free 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.680
 so basically for those who like them 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.900
 organic products this stuff and hop 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.210
 then at the level of the ingredients that 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.210
 contains alcohol from the water of the perfume 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.360
 so the mix that makes 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:31.000
 cherry blossom flowers is this 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.860
 not and then really that things 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.300
 so watercolor way it's certified organic 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.680
 or ecocert good name is written natural this 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.210
 ready but no actually I thought they 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.470
 were certified but it's not written 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.110
 on the mesh laboratory made in 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.789
 la France 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.930
 oh no it's not written finally anyway 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.310
 the composition of a she is not 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.370
 really do not really have any 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.990
 problem so I really like 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.030
 are found that the bottle is really 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.169
 where the enemy and I did not think that 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.349
 was 50 milliliters but yes it is 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:09.169
 I really love this little perfume my mother 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.550
 bought the one at the rose they are 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.849
 very very good also called air of 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.410
 pink 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.180
 so there were several he wants 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:18.919
 several perfumes but after that it was good 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.120
 sandalwood box taste so this is 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.520
 a little more masculine still little 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.199
 like smells but that's an odor 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.240
 super back because I hate them 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.380
 perfumes that embalm very strong and who 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.389
 stay until the end of the day 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.210
 I like smells a little light 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:33.800
 and that do not last too much here I like 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.139
 although a perfume a toilet water in 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.599
 the occurrence is ephemeral here it is 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:39.740
 what I like in the perfume so that 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.880
 will not suit everyone but 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.090
 I really think it's a super 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.099
 shopping so that's it for you 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.110
 show my little purchases I hope that 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:50.900
 you can find that too at home 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.520
 your noz do not hesitate to tell me if 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.870
 you found something else
