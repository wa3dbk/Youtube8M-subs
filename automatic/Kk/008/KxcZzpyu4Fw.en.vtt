right now by just turn the Machine off

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.670 
right now by just turn the Machine off
on<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:26.939> mid-cycle<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.500> what<00:00:28.590> I've

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on those mid-cycle so that's what I've

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
on those mid-cycle so that's what I've
done<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> simulate<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> problem

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
done to simulate the problem

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
done to simulate the problem
take<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.599> brew<00:00:30.869> group<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.920> needs<00:00:32.099> your

out<00:00:39.950> okay<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.700> case<00:00:41.969> well<00:00:42.690> well<00:00:43.079> first

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
out okay in this case well well first

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
out okay in this case well well first
thing<00:00:43.440> you'll<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.980> turn<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> Machine<00:00:44.579> off

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
thing you'll do is turn the Machine off

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.100 
thing you'll do is turn the Machine off
and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.059> back<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.390> again<00:00:45.570> try<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and then back out again try and do a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
and then back out again try and do a
power<00:00:46.410> cycle<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.789> gets<00:00:47.940> back<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
power cycle so it actually gets back to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.760 
power cycle so it actually gets back to
its<00:00:48.390> home<00:00:48.420> position<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.079> may<00:00:49.200> work<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
its home position that may work for you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
its home position that may work for you
so<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.160> use<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> switch<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so just use the switch on the back of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110 
so just use the switch on the back of
the<00:00:51.750> machine<00:00:52.079> yeah<00:00:52.289> yeah<00:00:52.860> turn<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.820> turn

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the machine yeah yeah turn it on turn

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
the machine yeah yeah turn it on turn
off<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> red<00:00:55.890> light<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
off and on and then the red light on the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
off and on and then the red light on the
front<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> machine<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.940> blink<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
front of machine will blink here just

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.360 
front of machine will blink here just
push<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> button<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.710> try<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.010> turn<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> on

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
push that button to try and turn it on

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
push that button to try and turn it on
and<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> times<00:01:00.359> else<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> broke

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and a lot of times else all the broke

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
and a lot of times else all the broke
that's<00:01:01.289> correct<00:01:01.620> okay<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> doesn't

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that's correct okay and if it doesn't

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.000 
that's correct okay and if it doesn't
then<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> manually<00:01:04.140> first<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
then we have to do it manually first you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.240 
then we have to do it manually first you
come<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.460> check<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.540> arrow<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.250> that's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
come in and check this arrow here that's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
come in and check this arrow here that's
and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:09.180> where's<00:01:09.810> yeah<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.320> arrow<00:01:10.500> here

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and then where's yeah that's arrow here

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
and then where's yeah that's arrow here
if<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.549> turns<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.600> around<00:01:12.900> there

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if this turns all the way around there

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390 
if this turns all the way around there
so<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.470> line<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.220> hole

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
so they line up you're in your hole

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
so they line up you're in your hole
position<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.119> shouldn't<00:01:15.509> come<00:01:15.630> out

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
position it really shouldn't come out

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
position it really shouldn't come out
you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.159> give<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:17.970> force

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you know just give a little more force

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
you know just give a little more force
in<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.509> pull<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in your pull and there's that that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
in your pull and there's that that
little<00:01:20.159> tiny<00:01:20.460> arrow<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.939> there's<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.750> there

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
little tiny arrow up there's right there

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
little tiny arrow up there's right there
yeah<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.920> those<00:01:23.070> should<00:01:23.130> map<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.000> should<00:01:24.210> be

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
yeah so those should map they should be

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.670 
yeah so those should map they should be
at<00:01:24.390> rid<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.470> should

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
at rid of it and if they do it should

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
at rid of it and if they do it should
come<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.159> should<00:01:26.310> come<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.420> just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
come out it should come out you just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
come out it should come out you just
make<00:01:28.530> sure<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.799> pushing<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.369> good

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
switches that have to be tripped then to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.840 
switches that have to be tripped then to
the<00:04:37.090> machine<00:04:37.330> on<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:38.010> tab<00:04:39.010> on<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.670> dredge

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
the machine on this tab on the dredge

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.000 
the machine on this tab on the dredge
door<00:04:40.090> hits<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.840> one<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.430> okay<00:04:43.800> cut<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.830> piece

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
door hits this one here okay cut a piece
