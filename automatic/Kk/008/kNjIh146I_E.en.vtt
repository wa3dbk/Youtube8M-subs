00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
mixing like black and white so it's not

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.369

too<00:00:32.730> crazy<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> trick<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.080> stick

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
too crazy is that the trick like stick

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.410 
too crazy is that the trick like stick
with<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> color<00:00:34.860> theme<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.790> play<00:00:36.390> with

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with a color theme and then play with
