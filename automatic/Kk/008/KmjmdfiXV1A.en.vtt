00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.300
 I have flown on so many different aircraft types, all those years 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 I'm old already. Are you recording, no? 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.900
 I keep the children quiet and happy to have a good flight. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
 I think all they want is comfort 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.900
 Since July to this day, I have not seen the plane empty 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.900
 My life as cabin crew, I have met the man of my life and have two children. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 And I look forward to a few more years 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 This is my 32nd year 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 I am the oldest crew on the plane today 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I grew up with the airline. I started at the age of 20 - now I'm 52 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 What are you going to do in London this time? 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This time I am going to London to conclude the agreement on the A380 engine 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 Our boys actually learned a lot. You know, this plane got a motherboard 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
 It is good to have a partner like oneworld 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.900
 and making use of each other's strength 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.900
 and also the good reputation 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.900
 Hello all! The children are here. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900
 How many toilets? Eight! 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Hello everyone! The children are here (repeat). 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.900
 We store the meals here, but there are no meals anymore because all meals 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 sit in your stomach. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 Here is the cabin crew, who wants to try it too? 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Put the belt on under your belly 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 I think they (the children) are very excited to get to know the plane 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.900
 I am a private pilot but this is a totally different sport 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 A lot more exciting 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 It is a lot more challenging 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.400
 It is a new step for Malaysia Airlines 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.900
 We become part of a really excellent alliance, oneworld 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.400
 with very prominent airlines as members 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.000
 Such as BA (British Airways), Qantas, Cathay (Pacific), Japan (Airlines) 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.000
 I look forward to showing the other members 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 what Malaysia Airlines can do!
