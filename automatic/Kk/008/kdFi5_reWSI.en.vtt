the<00:00:01.410> next<00:00:01.650> one<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.920> have<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.490> bond<00:00:03.360> demo<00:00:03.750> this

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
the next one we have is a bond demo this

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.289 
the next one we have is a bond demo this
one's<00:00:04.350> actually<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.770> direct<00:00:05.250> duplicate<00:00:05.759> right

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
one's actually a direct duplicate right

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.410 
one's actually a direct duplicate right
off<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> original<00:00:06.660> plastic<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:09.210> one's

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
off the original plastic now this one's

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.180 
off the original plastic now this one's
a<00:00:09.510> little<00:00:09.540> more<00:00:09.719> complicated<00:00:09.929> because<00:00:10.469> these

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
a little more complicated because these

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.499 
a little more complicated because these
compound<00:00:11.730> curves<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.330> very

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
compound curves and here are very

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.480 
compound curves and here are very
difficult<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.380> form<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.190> able<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
difficult to form and be able to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.310 
difficult to form and be able to
maintain<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.480> shape<00:00:15.630> without<00:00:15.929> tearing<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
maintain the shape without tearing the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.279 
maintain the shape without tearing the
material<00:00:16.800> also<00:00:17.730> opens<00:00:18.180> up<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> metal

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
material also opens up here the metal

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.080 
material also opens up here the metal
actually<00:00:19.439> come<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.920> over<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.460> down<00:00:20.550> inside

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
actually come up over and down inside

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
actually come up over and down inside
this<00:00:21.300> recessed<00:00:21.720> area<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.769> again<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> just

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this recessed area this again is just

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
this recessed area this again is just
makes<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.300> difficult<00:00:24.859> we'll

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
makes it a little more difficult we'll

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
makes it a little more difficult we'll
start<00:00:26.070> off<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.970> mold<00:00:27.180> by<00:00:27.390> itself<00:00:33.800> what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
start off with the mold by itself what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.630 
start off with the mold by itself what
my<00:00:34.980> lumina

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
my lumina

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.139 
my lumina
this<00:00:36.600> time<00:00:36.980> instead<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> staying<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.640> top<00:00:38.879> I'll

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this time instead of staying on top I'll

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.330 
this time instead of staying on top I'll
actually<00:00:39.329> sit<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.140> underneath<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
actually sit them all underneath and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.030 
actually sit them all underneath and
just<00:00:41.520> kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.079> push<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
just kind of push it in get a kind of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.770 
just kind of push it in get a kind of
general<00:00:44.489> idea<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:45.930> everything<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:47.780> know

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
general idea of where everything is know

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
general idea of where everything is know
how<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.170> trailer<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> minute<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> need

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
how much my trailer or a minute I need

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
how much my trailer or a minute I need
to<00:00:51.360> leave<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> significant<00:00:52.500> amount<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to leave a significant amount of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
to leave a significant amount of
material<00:00:53.100> top<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.879> over<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
material top so they can go over and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.330 
material top so they can go over and
then<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> also<00:00:55.230> need<00:00:55.379> enough<00:00:55.710> underneath<00:00:56.100> here

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
then I also need enough underneath here

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.680 
then I also need enough underneath here
that<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.390> form

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that it can actually you know form

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
that it can actually you know form
around<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> active<00:00:58.320> Sonics<00:01:00.680> myself<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> line

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
around the active Sonics myself a line

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:16.880 
around the active Sonics myself a line
ago<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.680> have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
ago where I you can see you have

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.789 
ago where I you can see you have
somewhat<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.150> shape<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.470> gives<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
somewhat of a shape it gives you a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.120 
somewhat of a shape it gives you a
general<00:01:19.979> idea<00:01:21.380> I'll<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> myself<00:01:22.680> probably

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
general idea I'll get myself probably

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
general idea I'll get myself probably
another<00:01:23.570> 3/4<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.780> inch<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.430> liberal

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
another 3/4 of an inch or so liberal

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.719 
another 3/4 of an inch or so liberal
with<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> come<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.780> short<00:01:28.640> found<00:01:29.640> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
with it I want to come up short found in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.469 
with it I want to come up short found in
this<00:01:29.850> area<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.500> won't<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
this area here this one won't have

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.760 
this area here this one won't have
material<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> around<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.530> two

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
material going down and around in two

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
material going down and around in two
different<00:01:34.890> directions<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:36.630> actually<00:01:36.869> three

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
different directions it's actually three

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
different directions it's actually three
different<00:01:37.079> directions<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.100> need<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> have

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
different directions so I need to have

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.950 
different directions so I need to have
enough<00:01:38.640> material<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> give<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> some

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
enough material there to give it some

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
enough material there to give it some
strength<00:01:43.159> then<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> area<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.000> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
strength then in this area here it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
strength then in this area here it's
obviously<00:01:46.140> longer<00:01:46.439> than<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> side<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.939> what

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
obviously longer than that side so what

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.069 
obviously longer than that side so what
I<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.420> lose<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:48.960> more

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I do is just lose a little bit more

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.690 
I do is just lose a little bit more
material

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.920 

now<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.760> cuticle<00:01:55.180> scissors<00:01:55.300> come<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.720> place

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
now the cuticle scissors come in place

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.750 
now the cuticle scissors come in place
here<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.260> need<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.470> remove<00:01:56.830> enough<00:01:57.550> of<00:01:57.670> this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
here I need to remove enough of this

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.070 
here I need to remove enough of this
material<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.210> actually<00:01:58.510> start<00:01:58.690> working<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
material that actually start working the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.550 
material that actually start working the
metal

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
metal

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.200 
metal
I<00:01:59.590> don't<00:02:00.280> want<00:02:00.400> remove<00:02:00.580> too<00:02:00.850> much<00:02:01.030> because

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
I don't want remove too much because

I'll be very liberal with it with a
metal<00:02:15.010> ring<00:02:15.220> ago<00:02:15.900> place<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.050> down<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.620> mold

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
metal ring ago place it down on the mold

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.740 
metal ring ago place it down on the mold
itself<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.780> I'll<00:02:19.900> start<00:02:20.140> getting<00:02:21.720> some<00:02:22.720> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
itself and I'll start getting some of

this<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.630> show<00:02:25.840> through<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.770> remove<00:02:27.070> that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
this to show through and you remove that

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.040 
this to show through and you remove that
as<00:02:27.340> well<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.570> too<00:02:28.780> much<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
as well because it's just too much the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.660 
as well because it's just too much the
trailer<00:02:29.380> try<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> form<00:02:29.890> around<00:02:30.010> if<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.400> had

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
trailer try to form around if it had

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
trailer try to form around if it had
that<00:02:30.790> extra<00:02:31.000> sole<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.480> there<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:35.230> also<00:02:35.350> gives

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that extra sole in there it's also gives

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.340 
that extra sole in there it's also gives
me<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.710> little<00:02:35.890> bit<00:02:35.980> better<00:02:36.100> idea<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:37.260> where<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
me a little bit better idea of where the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.380 
me a little bit better idea of where the
tops<00:02:38.620> gonna<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> mold<00:02:40.210> line

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
tops gonna be you see the mold line

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.920 
tops gonna be you see the mold line
start<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.750> show<00:02:40.930> up<00:02:41.080> there<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.420> excess<00:02:43.750> on

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
start to show up there and the excess on

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.760 
start to show up there and the excess on
the<00:02:43.990> bottom<00:02:44.350> which<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.560> don't<00:02:44.740> need<00:02:49.590> I'll<00:02:50.590> come

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
the bottom which I don't need I'll come

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:23.900 
the bottom which I don't need I'll come
back<00:02:50.890> one<00:02:51.070> more<00:02:51.190> time

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.190 

I<00:03:25.820> also<00:03:26.820> need<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> remember<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:28.050> this

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
I also need to remember that in this

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.100 
I also need to remember that in this
area<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.590> top<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.160> need<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.910> leave<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.060> lip<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
area up top I need to leave a lip on the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.170 
area up top I need to leave a lip on the
inside<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.710> I<00:03:31.860> was<00:03:32.280> made<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> attach<00:03:32.700> my<00:03:32.880> panel

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
inside it I was made to attach my panel

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.770 
inside it I was made to attach my panel
to<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.330> rest<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.720> body

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
to the rest of the body

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.920 
to the rest of the body
he<00:03:36.780> started<00:03:37.700> start<00:03:38.700> doing<00:03:39.030> similar<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
he started start doing similar to the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.850 
he started start doing similar to the
other<00:03:40.080> one<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.440> work<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.160> around

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.400 

I<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.880> as<00:03:52.330> many<00:03:52.600> creases<00:03:53.020> as<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.230> can

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
I think it is as many creases as I can

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.840 
I think it is as many creases as I can
across<00:03:53.710> here<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.040> more<00:03:54.190> creases<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.640> better

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
across here the more creases the better

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.160 
across here the more creases the better
it<00:03:55.090> allows<00:03:55.300> me<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.980> stretch<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.220> middle<00:04:00.120> start

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
it allows me to stretch the middle start

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.260 
it allows me to stretch the middle start
pushing<00:04:02.170> on<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.380> with<00:04:02.530> my<00:04:02.680> hands<00:04:02.920> again<00:04:03.910> this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
pushing on it with my hands again this

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.760 
pushing on it with my hands again this
is<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.510> reason<00:04:04.780> why<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:04.960> do<00:04:05.140> not<00:04:05.380> use<00:04:05.620> the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
is the reason why I do not use the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.950 
is the reason why I do not use the
original<00:04:06.130> plastic<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:07.390> hard<00:04:07.600> bodies<00:04:07.900> just

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
original plastic the hard bodies just

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.320 
original plastic the hard bodies just
don't<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.500> enough<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.980> handle<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.030> kind<00:04:10.270> of

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
don't have enough to handle this kind of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.080 
don't have enough to handle this kind of
force<00:04:10.600> being<00:04:10.810> applied<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.320> them<00:04:11.940> they<00:04:12.940> would

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
force being applied to them they would

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.310 
force being applied to them they would
crack<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.480> gray<00:04:13.810> really<00:04:14.410> easily<00:04:16.200> all<00:04:17.200> right

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
crack and gray really easily all right

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.569 
crack and gray really easily all right
with<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> general<00:04:17.799> shape<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.160> place<00:04:18.370> they'll

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
with the general shape in place they'll

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.200 
with the general shape in place they'll
come<00:04:18.760> back<00:04:18.880> with<00:04:19.060> my<00:04:19.380> blood<00:04:20.380> tools<00:04:20.650> again<00:04:21.210> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
come back with my blood tools again and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.120 
come back with my blood tools again and
now<00:04:22.330> start<00:04:22.660> pulling<00:04:23.470> in<00:04:24.090> back<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.360> forth<00:04:26.130> and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
now start pulling in back and forth and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.520 
now start pulling in back and forth and
try<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.340> stretch<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.760> material<00:04:28.180> out<00:04:28.380> go<00:04:29.380> right

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
try to stretch the material out go right

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.850 
try to stretch the material out go right
across<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:31.110> wrinkled<00:04:32.110> edges<00:04:32.470> those<00:04:32.680> will

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
across the wrinkled edges those will

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.280 
across the wrinkled edges those will
eventually<00:04:32.950> come<00:04:33.370> out<00:04:33.520> once<00:04:33.760> they<00:04:33.880> get

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
eventually come out once they get

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:44.100 
eventually come out once they get
working<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:35.770> later<00:04:42.540> slowly<00:04:43.540> work<00:04:43.780> my<00:04:43.810> way

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
working on them later slowly work my way

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.980 
working on them later slowly work my way
in<00:04:44.290> towards<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.100> heavy<00:04:46.060> detail<00:04:46.510> which<00:04:46.960> is

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
in towards the heavy detail which is

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.790 
in towards the heavy detail which is
this<00:04:47.260> portion<00:04:47.560> in<00:04:47.770> here<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:50.470> work<00:04:50.620> my<00:04:50.770> way

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
this portion in here and work my way

00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:01.750 
this portion in here and work my way
around<00:04:52.410> stretching<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.530> as<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.890> go

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.140 

you<00:05:02.300> can<00:05:02.450> start<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.780> see<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:04.430> compound<00:05:04.790> curves

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
you can start to see the compound curves

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.000 
you can start to see the compound curves
take<00:05:05.390> shape<00:05:05.890> as<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:07.040> stretch<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.460> metal<00:05:07.670> up

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
take shape as I stretch the metal up

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.650 
take shape as I stretch the metal up
down<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.160> along<00:05:10.430> here<00:05:10.730> just<00:05:10.940> do<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.510> same

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
down and along here just do the same

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.850 
down and along here just do the same
thing<00:05:11.720> I'll<00:05:12.080> put<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.350> pressure<00:05:12.560> on<00:05:12.680> both

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
thing I'll put the pressure on both

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.390 
thing I'll put the pressure on both
sides<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:14.030> work<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.330> back<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.540> forth<00:05:15.400> this

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
sides just work it back and forth this

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.430 
sides just work it back and forth this
action<00:05:17.060> working<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.480> back<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.660> forth<00:05:18.050> slowly

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
action working it back and forth slowly

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.040 
action working it back and forth slowly
stretches<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.250> metal<00:05:19.520> out<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:20.630> allow<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.020> to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
stretches the metal out and allow it to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.440 
stretches the metal out and allow it to
release<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:22.370> release<00:05:22.670> of<00:05:22.970> that's<00:05:23.300> the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
release the release of that's the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.110 
release the release of that's the
molecules<00:05:24.070> relaxed<00:05:25.070> and<00:05:25.460> allows<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.090> to

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
molecules relaxed and allows you to

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.380 
molecules relaxed and allows you to
stretch<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.510> some<00:05:26.690> more<00:05:27.880> it's<00:05:28.880> containing<00:05:29.210> the

stretch it some more it's containing the
back<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:29.750> forth<00:05:33.610> now<00:05:34.610> this<00:05:34.820> is<00:05:35.000> actually<00:05:35.180> a

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
back and forth now this is actually a

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.910 
back and forth now this is actually a
little<00:05:35.450> bit<00:05:35.600> too<00:05:35.720> much<00:05:35.870> material<00:05:36.050> inside<00:05:36.620> here

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
little bit too much material inside here

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.650 
little bit too much material inside here
so<00:05:37.550> what<00:05:37.670> I<00:05:37.700> do<00:05:37.850> is<00:05:37.910> I'll<00:05:38.060> come<00:05:38.180> back<00:05:38.300> with<00:05:38.450> my

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
so what I do is I'll come back with my

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.940 
so what I do is I'll come back with my
scissors<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.360> I'll<00:05:41.360> trim<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.750> out<00:05:41.840> but<00:05:42.830> leave

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
scissors and I'll trim it out but leave

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.410 
scissors and I'll trim it out but leave
too<00:05:43.130> much<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.370> travel<00:05:43.670> in<00:05:43.730> your<00:05:43.880> energy

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
too much to travel in your energy

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.730 
too much to travel in your energy
it's<00:05:44.840> more<00:05:45.140> difficult<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:47.290> deform<00:05:48.290> it's<00:05:48.590> also

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
it's more difficult to deform it's also

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.790 
it's more difficult to deform it's also
more<00:05:48.950> difficult<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.340> trim<00:05:49.610> later<00:05:49.850> on<00:05:50.770> as<00:05:51.770> you

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
more difficult to trim later on as you

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.990 
more difficult to trim later on as you
can<00:05:52.010> see<00:05:52.160> it's<00:05:52.310> already<00:05:52.430> getting<00:05:52.580> tough<00:05:52.880> to

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
can see it's already getting tough to

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.850 
can see it's already getting tough to
get<00:05:53.090> in<00:05:53.210> there<00:05:53.360> with<00:05:53.480> these<00:05:53.740> it's<00:05:54.740> these

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
get in there with these it's these

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.560 
get in there with these it's these
cuticle<00:05:55.310> scissors<00:05:57.070> but<00:05:58.070> at<00:05:58.160> this<00:05:58.280> point<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:59.480> be

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
cuticle scissors but at this point to be

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.370 
cuticle scissors but at this point to be
too<00:05:59.800> too<00:06:00.800> delicate<00:06:01.010> about<00:06:01.460> it<00:06:01.580> because<00:06:01.850> I'm

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
too too delicate about it because I'm

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.890 
too too delicate about it because I'm
forcing<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.530> metal<00:06:03.710> back<00:06:03.830> in<00:06:04.010> there<00:06:04.190> again<00:06:04.900> so

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
forcing the metal back in there again so

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.180 
forcing the metal back in there again so
even<00:06:06.050> if<00:06:06.140> I<00:06:06.200> bend<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.530> up<00:06:06.590> a<00:06:06.650> little<00:06:06.710> bit<00:06:06.920> not<00:06:07.130> a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
even if I bend it up a little bit not a

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.580 
even if I bend it up a little bit not a
big<00:06:07.370> deal
