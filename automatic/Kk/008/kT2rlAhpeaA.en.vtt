intensifies a scholar teri sounds is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.310 
intensifies a scholar teri sounds is
called<00:01:25.790> Fernando<00:01:26.790> scope<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.200> the

called Fernando scope and so that is the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
called Fernando scope and so that is the
main<00:01:31.530> difference<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> Fernando

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
main difference and with a Fernando

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.870 
main difference and with a Fernando
scope<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> hear<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> sound<00:01:35.420> amplified<00:01:36.420> and

they're<00:02:15.850> both<00:02:16.120> there's<00:02:16.630> telescopes<00:02:17.380> and

they're both there's telescopes and
financial<00:02:18.100> scopes<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.030> usually<00:02:19.810> people<00:02:20.280> know

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
financial scopes and usually people know

financial scopes and usually people know
the<00:02:21.760> status<00:02:22.120> copes<00:02:22.390> there<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.320> think<00:02:23.440> they're

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
the status copes there I think they're

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.850 
the status copes there I think they're
cheaper<00:02:24.130> as<00:02:24.250> well<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.140> reading<00:02:29.530> here

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
cheaper as well there I'm reading here

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.340 
cheaper as well there I'm reading here
that<00:02:29.890> there<00:02:30.340> are<00:02:30.370> acoustic<00:02:31.120> status<00:02:31.870> cups<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
that there are acoustic status cups and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.790 
that there are acoustic status cups and
electronic<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.930> really<00:02:38.200> interesting

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
electronic and not really interesting

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.390
