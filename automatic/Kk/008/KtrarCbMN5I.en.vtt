00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.140
 savings there's a lot of blood sweat and tears in these caves 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 I do not mean many times when he and his people confronted the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.240
 danger but also to the Benedictine history they suffered a great earthquake 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.570
 here in the year 747 and many of those caves sank 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.779
 the roofs collapsed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.560
 many times they took their improvised columns and their ruinous foundations 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 while junji to the earth 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.530
 for this, this situation is vitally important 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 a view joyful bucket of water 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 where is the body 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.970
 the net 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 size as 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.600
 in these moments create a solid bond between younsi your collaborators 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.910
 what if in that case the face 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.340
 everyone 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.410
 palm 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 in order to 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.100
 4 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.420
 panties I do not have anything clear now 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.960
 etc 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.210
 it's like a family you can not live here in the trenches or the stores in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.290
 create a special bond 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.280
 for several years now and we will be investing your time insisting for 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 get the permit that allows them to dig 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.670
 where they believe the ark has been for more than twenty-five centuries 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.430
 but it could also happen that they are completely wrong 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.170
 yes art is here in action 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.480
 on tour 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.830
 from the day he left Jerusalem 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.920
 I felt hegoak are 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.620
 has been here osalan 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.710
 on the whole 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.640
 if not 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 you believe it 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.200
 I honestly do not think 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.620
 not only I do not 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.030
 all believers 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.260
 almost all the 20 thousand churches sense pious have a tabernacle and an object 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.170
 hidden 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.769
 symbol of the ark of the covenant 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.839
 and I have an idea how he got there 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.789
 as a gift that the queen of saba received from the king Solomon of Israel 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.469
 Ethiopian Christians firmly believe that the ark is here in Ethiopia 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.169
 he founded it from King Solomon 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.189
 and it reached the ears of the famous queen of saba 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 said in ethiopia 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:54.609
 what opened his heart were not the riches of the king but he was a man 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.609
 wise and his wisdom came from on high 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.159
 the legend says that the queen of saba visited King Solomon and that 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.309
 they fell in love and they had a son 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.149
 his name was smaller and that he and would have been the first emperor of ethiopia 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.069
 and King Solomon loved this son so much that he allowed him to have the most 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 sacred possession of israel the ark of the covenant 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.329
 that's how the most sacred of the relic is the symbol of the union 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.319
 between god and his chosen people as menelik etc 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.799
 he went from israel to ethiopia 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:33.519
 deny 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.709
 you can imagine the wisest man on earth building magnificent 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 east jerusalem temple to house the ark of the covenant 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.359
 Piti then give it to his son 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 so that the queen of saba 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.869
 I had it guarded in a straw hut 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.729
 Has no sense 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:03.089
 outside Ethiopia this legend never had credibility 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.150
 the bible leaves no doubt that the one who was in the Jerusalem temple during 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.539
 centuries after Solomon 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.639
 - and if it existed he simply could not take the art to Ethiopia without 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.989
 However, the belief that the orchestra in Ethiopia is deeply rooted in the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.539
 religion of that country 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 uu 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.520
 most of the experts place us the saba land in ethiopia for it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.430
 is the queen of saba wine of southern arabia the legend of menelik and the ark 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.430
 it would not be more than folklore 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:48.229
 and still the mystery of what happened with art was still standing 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.330
 above all was God 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.729
 given that he took the Jews to the promised land 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.739
 on the straight he was the incarnation of the god who defeated the enemies of israel 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.759
 register for the greatest mystery of the bible 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.469
 even perhaps the greatest mystery of all human history 8 this object 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.479
 that has no price in which it was believed that presided over the presence of God and that 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.879
 emanate the supernatural powers was center of worship in the primitive 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.889
 Judaic religion from which emerge the other great religions of the world that 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.080
 had disappeared this fascinated me jesÃºs that had vanished without 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.759
 leave no mention in the scriptures it seemed impossible to me there should be 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.849
 a story behind would have to see the truth to discover that it will clarify this 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.520
 enigma and that's why he brought me 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.470
 as a correspondent in Africa for a long time the writer grajales 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.290
 hancock to 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.729
 he had been fascinated by the legend of the uncle pio 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.809
 like other researchers he did not think it was true but for a few 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.259
 days that he spent in France an event occurred that led him to a series of 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.129
 new discoveries everything started in a small cafe in the plaza de la 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.050
 salt Cathedral 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.629
 please tell me why this restaurant is called the queen of saba 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:08.330
 because there in the north portico of the cathedral there is a statue of the queen of 

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.719
 saba 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.889
 in Egypt it has always been believed that the queen of saba was a real personage 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.510
 the scholars or has located in the south of arabia but here in the cathedral of 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.699
 sharp 3 amazingly corroborates what the Ethiopians claim about the queen 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.509
 of saba a statue of the queen of saba was placed in an African context 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.500
 with an Ethiopian figure at his feet bogota 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.100
 and when I saw that, I remembered my work in Ethiopia, the certainty that there was a 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.420
 real mystery in that country related to the queen of saba and more exciting 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.610
 1 here I find very close to the statue of the queen of saba an image 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.770
 of the ark of the aristide alliance 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.930
 and a strange inscription
