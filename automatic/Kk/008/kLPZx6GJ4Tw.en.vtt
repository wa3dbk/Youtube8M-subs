00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.630 
body products and skincare products also
I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.750> price<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.649> full-sized

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I think and the price of this full-sized

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.230 
I think and the price of this full-sized
bottle<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.950> 220<00:01:49.950> ml<00:01:50.189> bottle<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.970> price

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.380 
bottle this is 220 ml bottle the price
is<00:01:51.540> 1200<00:01:52.439> yen<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.340> price<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> box<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
is 1200 yen and the price of the box is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.920 
is 1200 yen and the price of the box is
1500<00:01:55.049> yen<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.850> quite<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.509> covered

idea what this was I was thinking this

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.660 
idea what this was I was thinking this
is<00:04:32.730> maybe<00:04:33.620> like<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.680> bubble<00:04:35.160> bath<00:04:35.340> or<00:04:35.400> something

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
is maybe like a bubble bath or something

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.360 
is maybe like a bubble bath or something
because<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.420> seemed<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.190> containing<00:04:38.190> some

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
because it seemed to be containing some

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.610 
because it seemed to be containing some
liquid<00:04:38.820> inside<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> did<00:04:40.020> some<00:04:40.170> research<00:04:40.320> on

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
liquid inside but I did some research on

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.160 
liquid inside but I did some research on
this<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.070> turns<00:04:41.280> out<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.870> a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170
