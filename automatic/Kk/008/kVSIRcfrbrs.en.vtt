00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello and welcome to noth 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640
 precautionary channel is my name 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.170
 his 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.320
 we show you how to do it right today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.530
 will start and that in focus quality 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 what we need for everything during 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 First of all pear 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.340
 we have the kind of conference here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 chosen by our farmer then need 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.670
 we still have a big chopping board 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 a small knife and a knife 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 melon cookie cutter that I further 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 course of the again so additional 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 white then we need one more 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 Victory for the dripping of the pears as well 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:45.450
 a bowl for the waste around the pear 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.039
 to cut right pieces is one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.110
 cutting machine makes sense 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.719
 Of course you can also make a planer 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.559
 use for it 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 then we still need stock lattice 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 for the devices and a hearing aid we 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.710
 have a lemon in this one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.710
 fit in new slots 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 so and now it goes to the point 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 the pear must be washed me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 always do this with lukewarm water 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.680
 This is simply about the one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 Dirt removed as well as any chemical 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 arrears 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 then the pears come in the sieve 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.640
 drain 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 but you can also do it with the cloth 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:43.350
 nice drying so finished now it works 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 to the cut pear describe the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 First the style and then we share the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:57.000
 pear in the half but strunk 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.469
 past so that it on a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 pear half is located 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.689
 Now we take our useful melons 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.819
 cookie cutter with this we can completely 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.890
 Economically hollow out the core 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 At this side of the pear we can 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.010
 sting a little deeper 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.269
 because the core shell bit 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.249
 deeper in it is the stream cut 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:29.349
 We are also very economical in a triangle 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:30.569
 and do not have to do that twice 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.370
 do 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.379
 now it's about the pears in 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.689
 uniform cut to cut 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.760
 we will be a cutting width of 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.700
 four and a half millimeters that's for us 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.459
 the optimal cutting width because if you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.129
 then the pears will cut too thin 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.290
 chips and if they are too thick 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.909
 then took the process is easy to 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.129
 Long 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:03.040
 that's why it's really important that you 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:06.129
 uniform cut inside has like that 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.139
 one should not serve the pear one 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.290
 disturbing that is so much skin included 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:15.310
 and this is deprived of the water 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:22.769
 then she will be back and hard 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.769
 you can eat or just dispose of it like that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.280
 Now it's all about the pictures 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.019
 Cut nicely and save with nice 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.909
 in between the lattices 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:42.729
 to arrange something to facilitate 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:46.290
 you can also go up the pears 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.290
 about the same size 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.750
 It is important as already said that 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.969
 you can not just simply the pear 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.459
 to each other so that the air of the 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.459
 Council of Europe can circulate through 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.069
 it is equally important that the 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.859
 do not overlap the bulb 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.319
 thus is a uniform drying 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.070
 Guaranteed looks really great 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.889
 now it goes off in which the apparatus 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.060
 we chose a cd for this model 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.340
 decided 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.090
 not all turks save the offer 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.000
 possibility in roccos due 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.770
 to dry as the temperature either 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.380
 can not be set too low 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.680
 or high temperature fluctuations 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.300
 to rule 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.930
 Furthermore, the air flows in this device 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.270
 horizontal rather than vertical 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.430
 we now have our pear here 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.160
 the temperature of 40 degrees celsius 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.460
 set for 24 hours 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.340
 Upper and lower heat that the Danube 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.550
 offers a low and normal mode 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.930
 we always have the normal mode 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.630
 turned on because otherwise the dÃ¶rren 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.100
 just take too long 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.040
 As you can see we already have here 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.320
 some lattice occupied and in the sittener 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.940
 you can see that they are pure 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.790
 pears did not turn brown 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.680
 this is just because we get that 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.130
 already turned on during refilling 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.200
 to have 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.970
 so you can also on the treatment 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.450
 with lemon juice respectively 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.820
 salt water abstain likewise prevented 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.340
 to turn on with the instant too 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.470
 the following process in the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.700
 In the meantime, we prepare ours 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.460
 twist off glasses in front 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.830
 These must be washed thoroughly 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.520
 one can read readers instead of the christophs 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.110
 So also use normal screws or screwed 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.800
 plastic container tupperware offers itself 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.800
 yes, too 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.410
 since we are opponents of plastic 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.389
 we recommend to use glass 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.650
 then this does not affect the 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.740
 taste of the good 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.500
 The glasses can thereby after the 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.470
 explanation also for other things again 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.080
 are used and therefore are 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:09.020
 environmentally friendly for disinfection comes 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.830
 the whole in the oven and indeed have 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.570
 we set 150 degrees 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.720
 as you know, the bacteria die 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.530
 100 degrees off we turn the whole thing now 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.979
 for 15 minutes and leave the glass 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.979
 indoors 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:34.660
 be careful to remove the glass from the hot 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.660
 oven and classic cool 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:41.390
 Now let's see how far our jobs are 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.060
 already that looks pretty good 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.270
 out with the fingertip one can check 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.560
 if that is good already through 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.190
 the skin is no longer against each other 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.400
 move is done the whole thing 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.710
 optimum residual moisture is 14 percent 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.500
 at about 30 percent are the 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.910
 Bacteria do their work 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.930
 Molds, on the other hand, are more persistent 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.830
 and only give up at 14 percent though 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.810
 do not worry 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.520
 with time you get a feeling 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:15.470
 for how drier it should be 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.070
 The pear cities can now completely 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.780
 Loosely filled in the glasses 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:26.870
 By the way, that looks pretty nice 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:28.600
 decorative out of important is now the glass 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.430
 to close airily 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.290
 otherwise it may be the moisture 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.130
 to accept the room air and fast 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.950
 spoil 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.110
 it is best to store the whole thing in 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.170
 basement on a dark cool and 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:45.130
 dry place thank you for watching 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.130
 until next time
