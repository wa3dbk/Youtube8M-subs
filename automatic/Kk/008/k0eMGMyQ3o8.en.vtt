an Arabian what you need to do is you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.120 
an Arabian what you need to do is you
need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> join<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.700> first<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:14.960> there

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
need to join up first of all there

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.570 
need to join up first of all there
arabians<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.340> dished<00:01:17.610> faces<00:01:19.250> going<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> up

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
arabians have dished faces going on up

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
arabians have dished faces going on up
to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> brow<00:01:24.350> when<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> comes<00:01:25.650> down<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> doing

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to the brow when it comes down to doing

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
to the brow when it comes down to doing
your<00:01:26.250> muzzle<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.180> depends<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.960> want

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.630 

I'm<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.929> draw<00:01:36.109> my<00:01:36.409> horses<00:01:36.890> models<00:01:37.340> that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
I'm going to draw my horses models that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.849 
I'm going to draw my horses models that
look<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.240> nostrils<00:01:38.899> are<00:01:39.939> flared<00:01:41.859> like

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
look like the nostrils are flared like

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.300 
look like the nostrils are flared like
so<00:01:43.219> if<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.670> abided<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.210> lip<00:01:44.390> shape

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
so if you are abided that lip shape

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.520 
so if you are abided that lip shape
which<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.609> eventually<00:01:47.270> where<00:01:47.600> my<00:01:47.719> nostrils

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
which is eventually where my nostrils

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.850 
which is eventually where my nostrils
going<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.799> be<00:01:48.920> why<00:01:49.310> not<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.909> looks<00:01:50.060> like

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
going to be why not so it looks like

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.059 
going to be why not so it looks like
course<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.039> really<00:01:52.250> breathing<00:01:53.409> out<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:57.560> need

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
course is really breathing out you need

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.270 
course is really breathing out you need
to<00:01:58.520> see<00:01:59.390> where<00:01:59.539> this<00:01:59.659> line<00:01:59.899> goes<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.979> need<00:02:01.159> to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
to see where this line goes you need to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.449 
to see where this line goes you need to
join<00:02:01.490> up<00:02:01.869> where<00:02:02.869> your<00:02:03.109> thing<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.380> where<00:02:04.250> your

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
join up where your thing and where your

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.370 
join up where your thing and where your
line<00:02:04.670> there<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.319> I'm<00:02:06.319> going<00:02:07.009> on<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.340> their

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
line there and I'm going on to their

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.890 
line there and I'm going on to their
where<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.649> extra<00:02:10.009> line<00:02:10.220> was<00:02:10.519> join<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.660> round

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
where the extra line was join it round

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.089 
where the extra line was join it round
and<00:02:12.200> go<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:14.319> your<00:02:15.700> egg<00:02:16.700> shape<00:02:17.680> I'm<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:18.890> do

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
and go up your egg shape I'm going to do

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.210 
and go up your egg shape I'm going to do
is<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.879> rub<00:02:20.269> out<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.799> top<00:02:22.160> line<00:02:22.459> there

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
is you can rub out that top line there

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.900 
is you can rub out that top line there
the<00:02:25.220> line<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.730> goes<00:02:25.760> around<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.420> ear<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
the line that goes around the ear the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
the line that goes around the ear the
lot<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.750> two<00:02:29.989> lines<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.920> link<00:02:31.819> up

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
lot and then the two lines the link up

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.259 
lot and then the two lines the link up
there<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.099> just<00:02:34.400> neaten<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.879> where<00:02:35.239> you
