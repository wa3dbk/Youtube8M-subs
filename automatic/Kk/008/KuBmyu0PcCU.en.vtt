00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.700
 the central nervous system the system 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.890
 central nervous is a structure 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.670
 biological that is only found in 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.520
 individuals of the animal kingdom this is 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.369
 constituted by the encephalon and the medulla 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.589
 spinal the central nervous system is 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.160
 protected by three membranes which 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:25.310
 They are paranoid dura mater and mother 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.079
 these are also called meninges in the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.630
 cfi no the spinal cord are 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.780
 protected by bone envelopes that are 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.280
 the skull and the spine now 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.160
 we will talk about system pathologies 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.620
 central nervous one of the pathologies 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.960
 most important are accidents 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.649
 cerebrovascular which are divided 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 in two that are ischemic and hemorrhagic 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.820
 ischemic refers to an obstruction 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.540
 in an artery and hemorrhagic or a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.610
 hemorrhage in a host area 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.140
 some side effects of the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.290
 pathologies of the central nervous system 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.210
 are the fascias the aphasia is a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.550
 acquired language disorder 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.490
 product of brain damage that affects 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.720
 at all language levels 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.990
 remember that aphasia is a 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.990
 deficiency 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 there are two types of very important phases 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.600
 which are the berlin phases that affects 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.729
 the area 21 and 22 of buds man this 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.220
 affects the understanding of language and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 his memory his language this fluid type 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.799
 in terms of expression and articulate without 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.560
 difficulty the prosody is normal but 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 the sentences have no meaning 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 his choice is at the level of the two 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 later thirds of the first and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 second region of the storm the other phase 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 in the bit phase which affects the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.330
 44-45 area of outbreaks plus this phase 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.439
 expressive that affects spoken language 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.689
 have a loss of ability to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.930
 produce or understand the language 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.230
 spoken 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 he has a language not fluid his injuries 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.570
 at the level of temporoparietal frond that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.730
 affects the inner capsule and it 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.730
 extends to the crack of rolando 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.190
 some terms 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 of pathologies of the nervous system 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.830
 central are the mono beaches that the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.680
 immobility in an extremity is the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.050
 hemiplegia which is immobility in 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.470
 upper extremities plus lower ones 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.240
 and the monkey's face looked like 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.760
 alteration of movement in a 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.140
 limb and hemiparesis in the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.080
 alteration of movement in 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.380
 lower upper limbs or the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.380
 face
