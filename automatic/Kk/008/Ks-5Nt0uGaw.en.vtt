transmitter<00:00:31.949> stand<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> guess<00:00:32.759> bolts<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
transmitter stand here I guess bolts to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.020 
transmitter stand here I guess bolts to
the<00:00:33.750> back<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.460> pany

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the back of it and you would like pany

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
the back of it and you would like pany
likes<00:00:36.300> lots<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.750> metal<00:00:37.079> lots<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.620> muscle<00:00:38.070> keeps

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
likes lots of metal lots of muscle keeps

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
likes lots of metal lots of muscle keeps
it<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> dirt<00:00:39.120> hey<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:40.050> Greg<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it out of the dirt hey I'm Greg that and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
it out of the dirt hey I'm Greg that and
then<00:00:41.510> since<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.840> opposable

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
thumbs you've got some nice spiky deals
for<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.329> top<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.960> yes<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.440> sticky

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
for going on top of here yes it's sticky

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910 
for going on top of here yes it's sticky
to<00:00:50.039> stick<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.879> queue<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.379> these

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to stick in the queue okay then these

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
to stick in the queue okay then these
are<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.219> rounder<00:00:53.879> larger<00:00:54.480> stick<00:00:54.719> ins<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
are some rounder larger stick ins I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.240 
are some rounder larger stick ins I
guess<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.559> stick<00:00:55.800> ins<00:00:55.980> aren't

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
guess these are all stick ins aren't

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
guess these are all stick ins aren't
they<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.420> short<00:00:57.660> ones<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.379> think

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
they you got some short ones and I think

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.529 
they you got some short ones and I think
those<00:00:58.770> build<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.489> switches<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.120> with

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
those build all these switches that with

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
those build all these switches that with
the<00:01:00.690> eighties<00:01:01.109> man<00:01:01.800> although<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.940> aren't

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the eighties man although there aren't

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.390 
the eighties man although there aren't
case<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.229> level<00:01:04.530> goes<00:01:04.650> rattle<00:01:05.010> hold<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
case the level goes rattle hold you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160 
case the level goes rattle hold you
could<00:01:05.549> put<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> throttle<00:01:06.390> giant<00:01:06.960> yeah

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
could put it on the throttle giant yeah

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
could put it on the throttle giant yeah
yep<00:01:07.560> yay<00:01:07.770> I've<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.729> set<00:01:08.939> screws<00:01:09.210> on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
yep yay I've got little set screws on

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.200 
yep yay I've got little set screws on
them<00:01:09.510> they're<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> attach<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.430> switch

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
them they're that attach to the switch

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179 
them they're that attach to the switch
so<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.540> won't<00:01:12.689> fall<00:01:12.869> off<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> we've<00:01:14.100> got

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so they won't fall off so we've got

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.440 
so they won't fall off so we've got
small<00:01:14.460> ones<00:01:14.670> large<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
small ones large one so you can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990 
small ones large one so you can
differentiate<00:01:15.930> between<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.830> sides<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
differentiate between your two sides and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.710 
differentiate between your two sides and
then<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.850> transmitter<00:01:20.850> balancer<00:01:21.390> if

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
then this is a transmitter balancer if

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
then this is a transmitter balancer if
you're<00:01:21.869> running<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.290> older<00:01:23.250> radio<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you're running a older radio like this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
you're running a older radio like this
it<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> big<00:01:24.450> battery<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it has the big battery in it the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
it has the big battery in it the
transmitters<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> whack<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
transmitters a little out of whack you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
transmitters a little out of whack you
hold<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.930> sweet<00:01:28.439> berry

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
hold it here and it's sweet berry

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.880 
hold it here and it's sweet berry
tail-heavy<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:30.079> put<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.229> guy<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.470> their

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
tail-heavy so put this guy on their

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.090 
tail-heavy so put this guy on their
backs<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.119> you'll<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.360> nice<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.600> level

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
backs it up or you'll be nice and level

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
backs it up or you'll be nice and level
don't<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.150> newer

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
don't really need these on the newer

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.170 
don't really need these on the newer
radios<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> four<00:01:38.549> cell<00:01:38.790> batteries

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
radios that have the four cell batteries

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.370 
radios that have the four cell batteries
in<00:01:39.299> them<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.930> heavy<00:01:40.110> weights

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
in them because all that heavy weights

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.200 
in them because all that heavy weights
off<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.369> balanced<00:01:41.909> okay

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
off of it so they actually balanced okay

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.580 
off of it so they actually balanced okay
but<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:42.990> still<00:01:43.020> running<00:01:43.290> mate

no problem yes you will be able to tell

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.790 
no problem yes you will be able to tell
tell<00:03:00.510> yours<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.320> different<00:03:01.620> heights

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
tell yours you see the different heights

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.710 
tell yours you see the different heights
too<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> can<00:03:02.640> put<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> tall<00:03:03.090> ones<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.600> the
