00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
was the armario helmet which I did not

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.699 
was the armario helmet which I did not
expect<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.540> guy<00:02:17.659> actually<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.260> only<00:02:18.349> took<00:02:18.650> me

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
expect the guy actually it only took me

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.860 
expect the guy actually it only took me
about<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:19.129> 20<00:02:19.549> kills<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.909> get<00:02:20.090> even<00:02:20.659> though

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
about like 20 kills to get even though

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.950 
about like 20 kills to get even though
it's<00:02:21.019> only<00:02:21.110> like<00:02:21.319> seven<00:02:21.739> min

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's only like seven min

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.960 
it's only like seven min
I<00:02:21.990> guess<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> good<00:02:23.070> item<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.550> start<00:02:23.820> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I guess it was a good item to start of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.420 
I guess it was a good item to start of
the<00:02:24.090> series<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.140> after<00:02:25.230> 60<00:02:25.710> kills<00:02:25.920> later<00:02:26.160> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the series so after 60 kills later I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.100 
the series so after 60 kills later I
finally<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> lotta<00:02:27.390> drop<00:02:27.630> which<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:27.900> dr

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
finally got a lotta drop which was dr

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.930 
finally got a lotta drop which was dr
mario<00:02:28.320> chest<00:02:28.680> plate<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.100> was<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.730> starting

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
mario chest plate I was really starting

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.460 
mario chest plate I was really starting
think<00:02:30.330> leaving<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> Armada<00:02:31.020> bus<00:02:31.260> because

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
think leaving the Armada bus because

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.170 
think leaving the Armada bus because
it's<00:02:31.770> not<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.220> best<00:02:32.310> method<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> make

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it's not really the best method to make

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's not really the best method to make
money<00:02:33.420> from<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.930> also<00:02:34.530> feels<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.950> wasting

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
money from it also feels like wasting

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.730 
money from it also feels like wasting
time<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.850> obviously<00:02:36.750> wanted<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> our<00:02:37.410> model

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
hilt because that's obviously about like

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840 
hilt because that's obviously about like
150<00:02:41.670> mil<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.780> before<00:02:42.930> coming<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.680> um<00:02:43.890> I
