I<00:00:10.320> plan<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.650> getting<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> reason<00:00:11.280> why<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
I plan on getting it the reason why I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.580 
I plan on getting it the reason why I
still<00:00:12.360> haven't<00:00:12.570> gotten<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.080> was<00:00:13.170> hesitant

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
still haven't gotten it I was hesitant

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.169 
still haven't gotten it I was hesitant
when<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> came<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:14.969> had<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
when it came out because one I had to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.660 
when it came out because one I had to
import<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.929> that's<00:00:16.139> too<00:00:16.529> expensive

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
import it and that's too expensive

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.529 
import it and that's too expensive
normally<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.940> jumped<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> game

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
normally I would have jumped on the game

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.420 
normally I would have jumped on the game
I<00:00:18.690> definitely<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.109> imported<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
I definitely would have imported but the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.460 
I definitely would have imported but the
gameplay<00:00:20.699> style<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.539> never<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
gameplay style I was never really to in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
gameplay style I was never really to in
to<00:00:22.740> hack<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> slash<00:00:23.369> games<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.710> know<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to hack and slash games so you know I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.470 
to hack and slash games so you know I
don't<00:00:26.039> know<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.340> much<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.640> would<00:00:26.760> play<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
don't know how much I would play it so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
don't know how much I would play it so
for<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.380> cost<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
for that much cost it would be kind of a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.769 
for that much cost it would be kind of a
waste<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.970> something<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.420> might<00:00:30.599> not

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
waste to get something that I might not

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.380 
waste to get something that I might not
even<00:00:30.990> end<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.410> liking<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> then

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
even end up liking that much and then

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
even end up liking that much and then
when<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> came<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.840> America<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.770> gonna<00:00:34.860> get

because it is very interesting to me the
first<00:01:14.340> game<00:01:14.549> i<00:01:14.580> believe<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> flashback

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
first game i believe is like a flashback

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.510 
first game i believe is like a flashback
you<00:01:16.500> start<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:16.950> i'm<00:01:17.130> skipping<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you start off at i'm skipping a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.859 
you start off at i'm skipping a
flashback<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> whole<00:01:18.360> story<00:01:18.659> right

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
flashback through the whole story right

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.160 
flashback through the whole story right
so<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> end<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.049> know

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so you go back up to the end of you know

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
so you go back up to the end of you know
before<00:01:22.350> time<00:01:22.799> skip<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.180> enough

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
before time skip so do they have enough

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.950 
before time skip so do they have enough
material<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> create<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> second<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.960> it's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
material to create a second game it's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
material to create a second game it's
very<00:01:28.110> interesting<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> originally

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
very interesting like I originally

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
very interesting like I originally
thought<00:01:29.729> hey<00:01:30.060> Cassie<00:01:30.390> boo<00:01:30.540> boo<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
thought hey Cassie boo boo so too is

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
thought hey Cassie boo boo so too is
going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> once<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.040> piece<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.400> over<00:01:32.670> then

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
going to be once one piece is over then

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to be once one piece is over then
they're<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> gonna<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
they're gonna have them to gonna do a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
they're gonna have them to gonna do a
whole<00:01:34.200> second<00:01:34.650> half<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> story<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.430> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
whole second half of the story right but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
whole second half of the story right but
no<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> seems<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.079> they're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:38.040> push

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
no it seems like they're gonna just push

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.100 
no it seems like they're gonna just push
another<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> first<00:01:39.990> one

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
another one out because the first one

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
another one out because the first one
was<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.439> popular<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> capitalize

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
was so popular they want to capitalize

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.600 
was so popular they want to capitalize
on<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> guess<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.649> yeah<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
on that I guess and yeah so we have a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.810 
on that I guess and yeah so we have a
new<00:01:45.180> world<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.810> Fishman<00:01:46.200> Island<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
new world we have Fishman Island and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
new world we have Fishman Island and
punk<00:01:47.820> hazard<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.390> maybe<00:01:48.540> we'll<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.020> more

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
punk hazard and maybe we'll get one more

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.450 
punk hazard and maybe we'll get one more
arc<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.590> before<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.280> comes<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:52.460> so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
arc in before this game comes out so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
arc in before this game comes out so
there<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.360> isn't<00:01:55.079> enough<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.829> had<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
there really isn't enough they had like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
there really isn't enough they had like
60<00:01:56.820> something<00:01:57.149> volumes<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.810> make<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> first

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
60 something volumes to make the first

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
60 something volumes to make the first
game<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.219> three<00:01:59.280> arcs<00:01:59.909> but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
game and now you have three arcs but

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
game and now you have three arcs but
what's<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.719> interesting<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.350> me<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
actually it feels like this game has

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.589 
actually it feels like this game has
announced<00:03:12.439> a<00:03:12.650> bit<00:03:12.920> too<00:03:13.159> early<00:03:13.389> but<00:03:14.389> at<00:03:14.540> the

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
announced a bit too early but at the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.599 
announced a bit too early but at the
same<00:03:14.810> time<00:03:15.019> I'm<00:03:16.010> actually<00:03:16.189> pretty<00:03:16.459> excited
