00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.429 
ephemeris now looking over or 4 March I
wouldn't<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.300> surprised<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.109> an<00:00:25.230> 8th

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
wouldn't be surprised if we see an 8th

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
wouldn't be surprised if we see an 8th
magnitude<00:00:25.619> earthquake<00:00:26.310> during<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.699> month

magnitude earthquake during this month

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.849 
magnitude earthquake during this month
as<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.080> strong<00:00:28.349> planetary

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
as we do have some strong planetary

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
as we do have some strong planetary
alignments<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.400> fall<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.420> definitely

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
alignments at fall so it's definitely

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
alignments at fall so it's definitely
worth<00:00:30.840> keeping<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> close<00:00:31.470> note<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.890> now

Venice opposing Saturn now this is quite

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
Venice opposing Saturn now this is quite
significant<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.760> its<00:00:59.910> own<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.690> have

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
significant in its own but we also have

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
significant in its own but we also have
a<00:01:00.960> strong<00:01:01.199> lunar<00:01:01.469> influence<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> moon

Earth<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> Sun<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.619> also<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.950> Mars

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Earth and Sun and we also have Mars

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
Earth and Sun and we also have Mars
being<00:01:20.670> involved<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.570> mercury<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.080> Uranus

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
being involved with mercury and Uranus

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
being involved with mercury and Uranus
and<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.549> an<00:01:23.640> interesting<00:01:23.820> aspect<00:01:24.090> here

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and we have an interesting aspect here

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
and we have an interesting aspect here
with<00:01:24.689> Venus<00:01:25.020> moving<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.380> between<00:01:25.740> Jupiter<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
with Venus moving in between Jupiter and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.120 
with Venus moving in between Jupiter and
earth<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.479> move<00:01:27.659> across<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
earth and if we move across we see that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.069 
earth and if we move across we see that
this<00:01:29.220> continues<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.939> Venus<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.720> Venus

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
this continues with Venus with Venus

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
this continues with Venus with Venus
Earth<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.439> Saturn<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.670> there's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> fairly

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
Earth and Saturn so there's a fairly

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
Earth and Saturn so there's a fairly
