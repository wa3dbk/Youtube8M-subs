has<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.239> be<00:00:33.700> roughing<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.820> kicker<00:00:34.850> but<00:00:35.390> look

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
has to be roughing the kicker but look

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.080 
has to be roughing the kicker but look
at<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:35.809> these<00:00:36.800> physics<00:00:37.309> look<00:00:37.640> what<00:00:37.760> happens

every<00:01:22.940> I<00:01:23.180> five<00:01:23.510> Madden<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:25.009> year<00:01:25.430> or

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
every I five Madden and this year or

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.350 
every I five Madden and this year or
last<00:01:25.940> year's<00:01:26.300> version<00:01:26.540> had<00:01:26.960> protected<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.360> I

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
last year's version had protected and I

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.810 
last year's version had protected and I
remember<00:01:29.990> seeing<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.440> same<00:01:30.830> situation<00:01:31.580> take

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
remember seeing the same situation take

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.020 
remember seeing the same situation take
place<00:01:32.150> in<00:01:32.360> Pro<00:01:32.540> Tech<00:01:33.130> where<00:01:34.130> animation<00:01:34.850> begins

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
place in Pro Tech where animation begins

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.660 
place in Pro Tech where animation begins
and<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:37.280> animation<00:01:37.970> will<00:01:38.390> either<00:01:38.630> determine

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
and this animation will either determine

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.990 
and this animation will either determine
my<00:01:40.670> outcome<00:01:41.300> where<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.930> can<00:01:42.320> either<00:01:42.610> get<00:01:43.610> free

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
my outcome where I can either get free

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.790 
my outcome where I can either get free
from<00:01:44.210> these<00:01:44.360> three<00:01:44.720> defenders<00:01:45.460> or<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.600> know

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
from these three defenders or you know

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.460 
from these three defenders or you know
break<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:48.830> tackle<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.520> run<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.090> know<00:01:50.470> what

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
break a tackle and run for you know what

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.130 
break a tackle and run for you know what
I've<00:01:51.590> learned<00:01:51.619> from<00:01:52.100> Madden<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:53.479> this

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
I've learned from Madden is that in this

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.980 
I've learned from Madden is that in this
situation<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:55.850> don't<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.600> an<00:01:56.780> idea

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
situation you don't really have an idea

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.590 
situation you don't really have an idea
of<00:01:57.350> what's<00:01:57.800> gonna<00:01:57.950> happen<00:01:58.039> all<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.119> know<00:01:59.300> is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
of what's gonna happen all you know is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020 
of what's gonna happen all you know is
that<00:01:59.710> that<00:02:00.710> animation<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.399> gonna<00:02:01.490> take<00:02:01.820> place

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
that that animation is gonna take place

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.120 
that that animation is gonna take place
and<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:04.789> either<00:02:04.910> be<00:02:05.119> free<00:02:05.509> or<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.979> know

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
and you can either be free or you know

and you can either be free or you know
be<00:02:07.310> taken<00:02:07.670> down<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.239> most<00:02:08.420> cases<00:02:09.640> two<00:02:10.640> and

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
be taken down but in most cases two and

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.040 
be taken down but in most cases two and
three<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.090> guys<00:02:11.150> gonna<00:02:11.570> end<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.930> at

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
three of these guys gonna end up at

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.270 
three of these guys gonna end up at
least<00:02:12.170> two<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.530> these<00:02:12.590> guys<00:02:12.769> they<00:02:12.980> end<00:02:13.100> up

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
least two of these guys they end up

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.640 
least two of these guys they end up
flying<00:02:13.579> all<00:02:13.850> over<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> place<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:15.470> won't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
flying all over the place and it won't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.569 
flying all over the place and it won't
even<00:02:16.150> respect<00:02:17.150> each<00:02:17.299> other's<00:02:18.250> physics<00:02:19.250> each

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
even respect each other's physics each

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.449 
even respect each other's physics each
other's<00:02:19.940> weight<00:02:20.290> balance<00:02:21.290> momentum<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.220> of

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
other's weight balance momentum all of

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.640 
other's weight balance momentum all of
that<00:02:22.579> but<00:02:23.420> let's<00:02:23.600> look<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:23.870> backward<00:02:24.320> let's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
three guys are gonna make an attempt on

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.820 
three guys are gonna make an attempt on
me<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.690> make<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.709> move

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
me and I make the move

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.440 
me and I make the move
played<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.490> regular<00:02:33.790> motion<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.030> again

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
played in regular motion like that again

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.220 
played in regular motion like that again
real<00:02:37.660> quick

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.070
