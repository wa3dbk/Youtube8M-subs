technique student as with the machine

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.420 
technique student as with the machine
fitted<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.950> there<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> very<00:04:50.330> very<00:04:51.430> supple

and nice stitch across a sheer one layer
again<00:04:58.850> remember<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.510> size<00:04:59.750> 10<00:05:00.110> needle<00:05:00.320> good

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
again remember a size 10 needle good

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.760 
again remember a size 10 needle good
quality<00:05:01.520> thread<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:03.110> stitch<00:05:03.350> length<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.710> a

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
quality thread and a stitch length of a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.120 
quality thread and a stitch length of a
12<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.639> 20<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.690> represent<00:05:06.260> about<00:05:06.530> 15<00:05:06.919> right

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
12 to 20 so I represent about 15 right

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.159 
12 to 20 so I represent about 15 right
now<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.730> this<00:05:08.030> is<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.300> very<00:05:08.540> very<00:05:08.840> smooth

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
now and that this is a very very smooth

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.510 
now and that this is a very very smooth
machine<00:05:10.180> completely<00:05:11.180> capable<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:13.130> look<00:05:13.400> at

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
machine completely capable and look at

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.600 
machine completely capable and look at
how<00:05:13.639> slow<00:05:14.150> we<00:05:14.389> can<00:05:14.600> go<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:15.590> extra<00:05:15.919> control

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.120 

very<00:05:19.610> nice<00:05:19.760> let's<00:05:20.330> go

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.580 

another<00:05:24.880> key<00:05:25.090> for<00:05:25.330> sewing<00:05:25.660> shears<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.260> in<00:05:26.440> your

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
another key for sewing shears is in your

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.170 
another key for sewing shears is in your
foot<00:05:26.830> pressure<00:05:27.130> which<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.550> up<00:05:27.730> here<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.060> we

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
foot pressure which is up here and we

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.970 
foot pressure which is up here and we
have<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.480> set<00:05:28.690> on<00:05:28.720> two<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:29.380> very<00:05:29.710> light

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
have it set on two it's a very light

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.580 
have it set on two it's a very light
pressure<00:05:30.280> that's<00:05:30.790> pushing<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.330> fabric<00:05:31.630> then

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
pressure that's pushing the fabric then

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:40.350 
pressure that's pushing the fabric then
we<00:05:32.860> would<00:05:33.010> set<00:05:33.220> it<00:05:33.340> higher<00:05:39.000> look<00:05:40.000> at<00:05:40.180> this

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
we would set it higher look at this

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.160 
we would set it higher look at this
right<00:05:40.660> now<00:05:44.550> okay<00:05:45.550> I'm<00:05:45.670> going<00:05:45.850> to<00:05:45.940> turn<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:47.020> off

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
right now okay I'm going to turn it off

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:55.700 
right now okay I'm going to turn it off
and

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710
