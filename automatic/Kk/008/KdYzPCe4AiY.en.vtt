00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.570
 and so friends all good evening today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 we are considering a game of rabbinical 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:18.290
 the newest game went on the incentive literally 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.340
 a couple of hours ago I immediately started from the start 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:25.070
 play without a short talk about duty 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.619
 waited for this game with interest watched her 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.510
 It is natural for pirate themes that everything 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.790
 it's very interesting ran a couple of hours in 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.540
 Generally a cruel disappointment me 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 comprehended 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.090
 for one simple reason pirate 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.670
 the themes are great just about implementation 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.449
 this subject here it is not very 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.449
 Zdorovskaya 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.350
 we would like seemingly pirates 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.449
 here they are drunk comes mechanics here 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.699
 of the game itself, it is so primitive and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.839
 Now you understand, I'll show you on 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:07.460
 a simple example here look here blue I 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:15.729
 private stand with he does not hear the captain 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.729
 groshev now I ask you all 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 and now this game but in all such that is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 spring she manifests as soon as you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 start interacting with any mpc 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 with any character well, that's a fight you now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:42.330
 show yourself see how cotton wool is like cotton wool 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.720
 they just do not even oh whip even funnier 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.260
 there are times when these soldiers 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.580
 they are generally so stupid there go 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.550
 walls rest against forehead possible around them 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.030
 run they shoot at you that is well 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.740
 here we are in this we have only everything 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 so much paperboard on this world 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.050
 although it would seem that here if you look 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.840
 like a static picture not even 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.020
 the picture just runs all the same on 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.330
 the view looks good but as soon as 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.740
 start interacting with someone 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.530
 everything from the pirate delete doesn't stay and 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.670
 trace 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.220
 here they are generally like how they killed them 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.489
 comrades there so I hacked a couple of pirates 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.489
 that's okay there 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.360
 all everything is like this and in short 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 approve the verdict is that play 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.000
 in assassin creed black flag but in this 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.760
 the game and of course the price of the game 900 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.550
 rubles is the usual edition of a luxury 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.980
 personally 950 rubles 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.800
 Naturally, for such money, I think 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.040
 it is not worth buying if there is a discount 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.900
 for example there is 75 percent then 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.860
 you can still see and since then in general 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.410
 not an option but in general this game is on 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.400
 better than risen 3 which is really 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.500
 mind and naturally worse than much worse 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.250
 than assassin creed black red 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.340
 Here's how it here and so well, of course solve 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.950
 you buy it do not buy well I would for 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.570
 such money is not recommended here on this 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.730
 everything was with you the world and how would look still 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.730
 everyone is happy for now
