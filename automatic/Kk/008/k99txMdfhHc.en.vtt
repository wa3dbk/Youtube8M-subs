in this video we are going to be

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.690 
in this video we are going to be
covering<00:00:03.259> partner<00:00:04.259> system<00:00:05.040> programming

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700

get into system programming you need to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.839 
get into system programming you need to

to exit out of program anytime you're in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.459 
to exit out of program anytime you're in
programming<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> need<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> out<00:00:34.170> if

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
programming and you need to get out if

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
programming and you need to get out if
you<00:00:34.559> don't<00:00:34.649> want<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> save<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> changes<00:00:35.870> that
