00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.980
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.720
 new skin this time it's about if 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
 will have some new indra faces without 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.480
 in front and start as usual with the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 War cries 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.990
 before proceeding to say that I do not know if 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.000
 will be the final voices and even 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.890
 end skills as 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.200
 they are currently in fact testing 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.970
 and in it many things can change 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.529
 as I said the war cries or 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.510
 even the effects of the skills 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.720
 if they change in the future, it will return 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.560
 to summarize the skin 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.560
 have a huge 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 the dance 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.760
 and laughter 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.270
 let's go to the spells here we see how it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.270
 move the character and how is it 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.550
 the auto tax 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.630
 the q 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.220
 the w 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.610
 another one 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.610
 live 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.990
 other than another w 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.190
 another Cuba and the r 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.800
 let's launch again another 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.620
 here we see also when they go 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.070
 disappearing the things we are going to 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.070
 check 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.390
 let's do with recovery 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.780
 and finally death 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.900
 until this skin I hope that I have 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.900
 liked and until the next video 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.150
 they 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150
 days
