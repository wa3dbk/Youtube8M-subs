00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.910
 and for him 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:11.320
 the white gentleman you know that the theory of 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.090
 delio rossi agree a 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.090
 we are in science 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.070
 that started with everything look you are one 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.009
 the first attacks when minute went 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.410
 30 and already warned with two situations 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.789
 clear of goal so lamented the weapons 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.710
 that wanted to get inside the court 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.169
 and another form was defined, not here it reaches the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.550
 river goal three minutes just a 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.640
 minute and a half after the situation 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.260
 previous luck the bounce that benefits 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.750
 a chain that is anticipated to be distracted 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.590
 the defense of union there is no elaboration 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:53.680
 it's not a bounce of the defender 20 when 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.969
 close is an advantage of error 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.550
 double error 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.949
 before when the ball exceeds output 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.870
 defensive and the last defender's mistake 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.030
 that I did not anticipate end up there for 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 define that it warned union with a shot 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.420
 of prawn 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:17.270
 if it comes is a great reaction in 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.520
 chain and had Castro as one of the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.979
 trivial union figures and castrated the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.450
 figures of the santafesino team but a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.470
 river that was far superior to union in the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 first part that had several chances 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.470
 boys 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.759
 with the forearm of the head this river 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.149
 who played with substitutes very alternative 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.350
 the alternative team their clients 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.539
 they were substitutes are the holders 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.520
 rights 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.220
 the second dioxide goal there is another one 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:11.690
 cavenaghi to give the previous play 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.690
 to freeze to participate 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.580
 I won 2 to 0 and the difference was good 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.180
 really at that point the game was 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.180
 very similar 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.780
 I'm one who reminded me of the match 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.490
 racing temperley with the difference of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 which union achieved the draw and you think 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.210
 that today on the door but it turned off river 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.370
 in the second part as he did flush in the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.040
 previous date and union came out with everything 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.870
 to take a very valuable point to 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.850
 keep an undefeated 15 games and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.500
 so that madelÃ³n continues without stopping in front of 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.500
 river as a technician this time the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 match is already in river power 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 psychological 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.950
 the situation from this 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.020
 the tide the party rhythm almost to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.460
 From this goal previous shock 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.890
 ponzio that brings out for me my union had 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.300
 come out with another attitude for me 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.030
 matter it does not matter I'm talking about the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.610
 attitude of this party towards the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.200
 players beyond obviously the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.240
 attitude and the effectiveness of this 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.800
 game for me what madelon wins 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.250
 criticize some technicians when they 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.980
 sorry garmin in what is the tie 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.660
 that was 0-2 a merit of madelon by 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.970
 the changes he made by taking out a defender 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 putting front on river court 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.340
 I came I lost sight believe these 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340
 shapes 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:02.069
 it seems to me to be the same as 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.069
 our openness to listen and trust me 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:15.459
 economic of the nights out has the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.459
 body inside the feet inside the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.459
 body 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.150
 has the body in the transmission in the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.820
 court and here we are divided and not 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:39.169
 we have to see five months of reasons 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:42.610
 of the referee that right and all this 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.610
 not for the area 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.160
 outside the area 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.160
 and the game ends 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.110
 a world 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.210
 very important 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.210
 annoyed the pique in the second goal but 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.950
 with great effort we are left with nothing 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.510
 I think the group blessed this 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.570
 opportunity I think we were the height 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.080
 and if you go to see there were 14 players 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.400
 of the club in the first team and I hope 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.900
 what you told them at halftime 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.340
 we had given the first time 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.290
 we went to look I think it was important 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.940
 the billiard entrance and then 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.170
 we risk with line of 3 3 with jon 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.240
 I could have done more than I could 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.470
 have stayed with the three and as not 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.060
 we could see each with the three what 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.750
 we could have lost so I think that 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.420
 the tie the game likes him were 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.180
 two matches in one the first time of 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.820
 a very good football production and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.680
 after the second time we went down a 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.460
 little bit the intensity they got 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 in the match 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.650
 we made some very very mistakes 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.690
 timely distractions ends 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.699
 tying a very very rare game that gives 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.830
 a lot of anger because in general we deserved 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.410
 win how are you going to do let's say so that 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.550
 can arrive and redo the 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.080
 tight is the one we had 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.849
 accustomed and that I think we 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.770
 it costs quite a lot to see now it 's up 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.210
 we had gotten used to a first 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.210
 he played cute and he obviously won 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.590
 the questions 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.140
 happy woman's day good night
