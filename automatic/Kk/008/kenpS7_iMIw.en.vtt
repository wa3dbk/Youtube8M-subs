so<00:01:41.910> we're<00:01:42.030> playing<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> first<00:01:42.600> level<00:01:42.900> now<00:01:43.230> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so we're playing the first level now of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.430 
so we're playing the first level now of
Leo's<00:01:43.860> fortune<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.870> can<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.050> there's

Leo's fortune and as you can see there's

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.610 
Leo's fortune and as you can see there's
this<00:01:46.560> trail<00:01:46.980> of<00:01:47.160> gold<00:01:47.400> coins<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.230> have<00:01:49.410> to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
this trail of gold coins and you have to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.950 
this trail of gold coins and you have to
go<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.730> collect<00:01:50.910> all<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.330> your<00:01:51.540> goal<00:01:51.720> that's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
go and collect all of your goal that's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.100 
go and collect all of your goal that's
been<00:01:52.140> stolen<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:53.010> as<00:01:53.240> well<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
been stolen from you as well as get to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
been stolen from you as well as get to
the<00:01:55.230> bottom<00:01:55.410> of<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.740> mystery<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.190> who<00:01:56.820> stole

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the bottom of the mystery of who stole

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.950 
the bottom of the mystery of who stole
it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.160 

so<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.650> game<00:02:02.799> involves<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.700> lot<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.659> physics

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
so the game involves a lot of physics

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.770 
so the game involves a lot of physics
based<00:02:05.350> puzzles<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.490> platforming<00:02:07.119> elements

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.050 

leo<00:02:10.780> has<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> couple<00:02:11.500> different<00:02:11.620> moves<00:02:12.220> he's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
leo has a couple different moves he's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
leo has a couple different moves he's
got<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> jump<00:02:13.920> he's<00:02:14.920> got<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.209> inflate<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.420> float

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
got a jump he's got a inflate and float

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.220 
got a jump he's got a inflate and float
move<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.209> he<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.360> also<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:19.780> heavier<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
move and he can also get heavier and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:31.630 
move and he can also get heavier and
drop<00:02:21.069> faster

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.950 

so<00:02:32.640> you'd<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.390> through<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> lot<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
so you'd be going through a lot of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.450 
so you'd be going through a lot of
different<00:02:34.260> environments<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.010> game<00:02:35.250> you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
different environments in this game you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
different environments in this game you
start<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.210> forest<00:02:36.780> demoss<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
start off in this forest demoss the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.050 
start off in this forest demoss the
environment<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.220> then<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.460> descend<00:02:38.850> into

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
environment and then you descend into

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.200 
environment and then you descend into
these<00:02:39.270> mine<00:02:39.570> shafts<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.550> as<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
these mine shafts and as you get to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.360 
these mine shafts and as you get to
later<00:02:42.360> levels<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.960> game<00:02:43.160> things<00:02:44.160> get<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
later levels in the game things get a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.910 
later levels in the game things get a
lot<00:02:44.520> more<00:02:44.550> complicated<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.110> platforming

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
lot more complicated and the platforming

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.320 
lot more complicated and the platforming
and<00:02:47.070> puzzles<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.060> trickier<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> your

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
and puzzles get a lot trickier so your

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.390 
and puzzles get a lot trickier so your
goal<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.720> each<00:02:54.840> level<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.740> collect<00:02:56.040> all<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
goal in each level is to collect all the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
goal in each level is to collect all the
gold<00:02:56.580> coins<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> them<00:02:57.540> are<00:02:57.630> obvious<00:02:58.080> in

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
gold coins some of them are obvious in

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.080 
gold coins some of them are obvious in
your<00:02:58.500> path<00:02:58.740> but<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.490> lot<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.670> them<00:02:59.820> will<00:03:00.000> be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
your path but a lot of them will be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.940 
your path but a lot of them will be
hidden<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.960> way<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.380> you'll

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
hidden and out of the way and you'll

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.690 
hidden and out of the way and you'll
have<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.310> go<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.640> search<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.150> them<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.490> you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
have to go and search for them so if you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.800

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
in-app purchases in the initial release

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.430 
in-app purchases in the initial release
there<00:04:36.740> are<00:04:36.860> 24<00:04:37.370> levels<00:04:37.790> as<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:39.020> can<00:04:39.169> see<00:04:39.410> right

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
there are 24 levels as you can see right

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.909 
there are 24 levels as you can see right
now<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.800> mean<00:04:40.040> these<00:04:40.190> levels<00:04:40.460> are<00:04:41.350> not<00:04:42.350> long<00:04:42.620> but

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
now I mean these levels are not long but

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.129 
now I mean these levels are not long but
they're<00:04:43.070> not<00:04:43.190> too<00:04:43.400> short<00:04:43.669> either<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.840> we<00:04:44.990> hit

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
they're not too short either and we hit

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.530 
they're not too short either and we hit
the<00:04:45.290> end<00:04:45.669> so<00:04:46.669> in<00:04:46.790> each<00:04:46.880> level<00:04:47.090> you're<00:04:47.330> trying

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
the end so in each level you're trying

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.840 
the end so in each level you're trying
to<00:04:47.630> collect<00:04:47.840> all<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.320> gold<00:04:48.470> pieces<00:04:48.850> you're

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
to collect all the gold pieces you're

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.969 
to collect all the gold pieces you're
trying<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.120> die<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.570> little<00:04:50.840> as<00:04:50.900> possible<00:04:51.139> that

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
trying to die as little as possible that

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.270 
trying to die as little as possible that
was<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.220> good<00:04:52.400> record<00:04:52.610> for<00:04:52.910> me<00:04:53.000> no<00:04:53.300> deaths<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.680> I

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
was a good record for me no deaths and I

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.340 
was a good record for me no deaths and I
think<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.000> just<00:04:56.060> got<00:04:56.240> my<00:04:56.479> best<00:04:56.720> time<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.560> not<00:04:58.040> bad

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
think I just got my best time so not bad

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.930 
think I just got my best time so not bad
so<00:05:00.350> that's<00:05:00.560> Leo's<00:05:00.830> fortune<00:05:01.070> coming<00:05:01.520> out<00:05:01.700> mid

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
so that's Leo's fortune coming out mid

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.669 
so that's Leo's fortune coming out mid
april<00:05:02.360> from<00:05:02.860> 1337<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.040> tilting<00:05:04.430> point
