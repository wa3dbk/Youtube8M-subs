00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
know his hands are pretty small for the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.470 
know his hands are pretty small for the
entire<00:03:25.810> figure<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:28.550> can<00:03:28.700> large<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.239> by

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
entire figure but you can large it by

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.009 
entire figure but you can large it by
adding<00:03:30.080> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.680> or<00:03:30.950> clipping<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.370> the

adding on the or clipping on the
symbiote<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.940> literally<00:03:35.690> grabs

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
symbiote and so we can literally grabs

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.840 
symbiote and so we can literally grabs
quiter<00:03:36.739> man<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.519> don't<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.760> a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
quiter man with it I don't have a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.729 
quiter man with it I don't have a
spider-man<00:03:38.360> figure<00:03:38.660> with<00:03:39.170> me<00:03:39.350> because<00:03:39.680> I

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
spider-man figure with me because I

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.050 
spider-man figure with me because I
haven't<00:03:39.890> actually<00:03:40.100> bought<00:03:40.459> one<00:03:40.489> they're<00:03:40.880> also

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
haven't actually bought one they're also

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.560 
haven't actually bought one they're also
on<00:03:41.269> clearance<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:42.730> bother<00:03:43.730> buying<00:03:44.120> any<00:03:44.420> of

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
on clearance but bother buying any of

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.720 
on clearance but bother buying any of
them<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:45.739> went<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.340> these<00:03:46.519> guys

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
them I really just went for these guys

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.789 
them I really just went for these guys
because<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.060> love<00:03:47.269> venom<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.170> really

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
because I love venom and I really

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.550 
because I love venom and I really
thought<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:50.030> got<00:03:50.570> my<00:03:50.900> money's<00:03:51.170> worth<00:03:51.200> with

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
thought I got my money's worth with

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.830 
thought I got my money's worth with
these<00:03:51.739> figures<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.880> little<00:03:53.299> bit<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.480> cheating

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
these figures a little bit of cheating

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.030 
these figures a little bit of cheating
on<00:03:53.959> hospital<00:03:54.380> for<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.100> figure<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.820> arms<00:03:56.390> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
on hospital for this figure the arms of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.190 
on hospital for this figure the arms of
this<00:03:58.040> spider<00:03:58.670> charged<00:03:58.970> venom<00:03:59.360> if<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.840> can<00:03:59.989> see

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
this spider charged venom if you can see

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.650 
this spider charged venom if you can see
it<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.680> painted<00:04:01.130> differently<00:04:01.610> from<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
it is painted differently from the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.270 
it is painted differently from the
shoulders<00:04:03.080> that's<00:04:03.380> because<00:04:03.799> it's<00:04:03.980> made<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.220> a

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
shoulders that's because it's made of a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.050 
shoulders that's because it's made of a
softer<00:04:04.900> rubbery<00:04:05.900> plastic<00:04:06.200> they<00:04:06.799> were<00:04:07.060> cutting

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
softer rubbery plastic they were cutting

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.140 
softer rubbery plastic they were cutting
costs<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.989> guess<00:04:09.410> on<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.860> figure<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.459> make

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
costs I guess on this figure and make

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.050 
costs I guess on this figure and make
his<00:04:11.360> arms<00:04:11.690> look<00:04:12.230> really<00:04:12.560> big<00:04:12.799> bigger<00:04:13.580> than<00:04:13.940> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
his arms look really big bigger than the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.690 
his arms look really big bigger than the
first<00:04:14.299> version<00:04:14.390> they<00:04:14.870> had<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.140> make<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.410> hollow

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
first version they had to make it hollow

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.400 
first version they had to make it hollow
so<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.729> bit<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.390> cheating<00:04:17.570> there<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.200> it

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
so a bit of cheating there but it

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.490 
so a bit of cheating there but it
doesn't<00:04:18.799> matter

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
doesn't matter

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.920 
doesn't matter
very<00:04:19.920> well<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:22.460> I'm<00:04:23.460> still<00:04:23.730> liking<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.210> can't

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
very well so I'm still liking it can't

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.680 
very well so I'm still liking it can't
fall<00:04:25.410> cause<00:04:25.650> bro<00:04:25.920> for<00:04:26.190> trying<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.550> save<00:04:27.450> some

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
fall cause bro for trying to save some

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.820 
fall cause bro for trying to save some
money<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.760> go<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:33.830> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
money on that so there you go the the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.560 
money on that so there you go the the
spectacular<00:04:35.790> spider-man<00:04:36.270> venom<00:04:37.050> figures
