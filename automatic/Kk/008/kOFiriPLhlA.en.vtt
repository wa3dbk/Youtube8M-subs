that<00:04:03.439> there's<00:04:04.099> no<00:04:04.250> demo<00:04:04.549> yet<00:04:04.729> with<00:04:05.239> revolution

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
that there's no demo yet with revolution

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.589 
that there's no demo yet with revolution
the<00:04:05.750> demo<00:04:05.959> came<00:04:06.139> out<00:04:06.290> around<00:04:06.769> July<00:04:07.189> and<00:04:07.599> we're

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
the demo came out around July and we're

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.360 
the demo came out around July and we're
at<00:04:08.810> we're<00:04:09.259> halfway<00:04:09.439> to<00:04:09.560> July<00:04:09.919> now<00:04:10.069> with<00:04:10.280> no

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
at we're halfway to July now with no

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.369 
at we're halfway to July now with no
double<00:04:10.609> yet<00:04:10.789> and<00:04:10.969> what<00:04:11.719> I<00:04:11.750> heard<00:04:11.989> from<00:04:12.319> one

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
double yet and what I heard from one

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.229 
double yet and what I heard from one
understanding<00:04:13.069> is<00:04:13.189> they're<00:04:13.789> kind<00:04:13.909> of<00:04:13.939> behind

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
understanding is they're kind of behind

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.870 
understanding is they're kind of behind
so<00:04:14.419> I<00:04:14.449> don't<00:04:15.109> think<00:04:15.560> we'll<00:04:15.769> see<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:16.250> game<00:04:16.519> and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
so I don't think we'll see that game and

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.180 
so I don't think we'll see that game and
I<00:04:17.469> expected<00:04:18.469> this<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.590> be<00:04:18.650> September<00:04:18.859> but<00:04:19.130> I

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.709 
I expected this to be September but I
don't<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.430> we'll<00:04:19.519> get<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:19.729> September<00:04:20.060> of

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:20.719 
don't think we'll get in September of

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.149 
don't think we'll get in September of
