00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
that you pretty much done the glitch if

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.910 
that you pretty much done the glitch if
you're<00:02:22.780> glitching<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.350> little<00:02:23.680> bit<00:02:23.830> in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you're glitching out a little bit in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
should actually spawn across the street

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.460 
should actually spawn across the street
and<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.900> vehicle<00:02:29.230> which<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.440> just

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and the vehicle which you just

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.040 
and the vehicle which you just
duplicated<00:02:30.310> will<00:02:30.460> be<00:02:30.580> inside<00:02:30.940> your<00:02:31.210> garage<00:02:31.300> so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
duplicated will be inside your garage so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.840 
duplicated will be inside your garage so
all<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.290> got<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.100> drive<00:02:33.340> inside

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
all you got to do is to drive inside

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.030 
all you got to do is to drive inside
your<00:02:34.060> garage<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.630> pretty<00:02:35.320> much<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.860> do

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
your garage and pretty much if you do

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.250 
your garage and pretty much if you do
actually<00:02:36.340> want<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.880> duplicate<00:02:37.150> more<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.930> order

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
actually want to duplicate more in order

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
actually want to duplicate more in order
to<00:02:38.380> sell<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.160> vehicle<00:02:39.820> more<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.390> more<00:02:40.570> all

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to sell this vehicle more and more all

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.570 
to sell this vehicle more and more all
you<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.170> do<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.530> do<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> same<00:02:42.070> exact

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
you have to do is to do the same exact

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.640 
you have to do is to do the same exact
process<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.690> said<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.470> basically

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
process like I said and that's basically

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.370 
process like I said and that's basically
it<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.340> once<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.150> duplicated<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:46.959> of

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
it and once you have duplicated all of

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.140 
it and once you have duplicated all of
your<00:02:47.500> vehicles<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.280> head<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.640> LS<00:02:48.910> customs

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
your vehicles just head to LS customs

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.479 
your vehicles just head to LS customs
and<00:02:49.690> then<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.260> sell<00:02:50.560> your<00:02:50.739> vehicle<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.370> I

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
and then you can sell your vehicle and I

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.460 
and then you can sell your vehicle and I
believe<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.850> does<00:02:52.090> actually<00:02:52.390> bypass<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
believe this does actually bypass the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.260 
believe this does actually bypass the
45-minute<00:02:54.040> wait<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.640> yeah<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.120> that's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
45-minute wait and yeah so that's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.760 
45-minute wait and yeah so that's
basically<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.720> for<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.140> unlimited<00:02:56.650> money

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
basically it for this unlimited money

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.440 
basically it for this unlimited money
glitch<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.340> said<00:02:57.520> in<00:02:57.700> yesterday's<00:02:58.239> video
