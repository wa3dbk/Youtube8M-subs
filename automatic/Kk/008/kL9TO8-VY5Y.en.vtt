outside and then here from the inside to
the<00:00:16.139> inside<00:00:16.619> you've<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.850> 10<00:00:18.240> inches

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the inside you've got about 10 inches

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120 
the inside you've got about 10 inches
which<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> width<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> tray<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
which is the width of the tray that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
which is the width of the tray that
we're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.460> putting<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.900> these

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
we're going to be putting on so these

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.410 
we're going to be putting on so these
already<00:00:22.769> set<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.609> place<00:00:23.910> there<00:00:24.330> will

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
already set up and in place there will

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330 
already set up and in place there will
drip<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> across<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.320> each<00:00:25.380> other<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.039> now

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
drip it across from each other and now

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.500 
drip it across from each other and now
we're<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> bring<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> Timbers<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we're going to bring in the Timbers that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:39.950 
we're going to bring in the Timbers that
go<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.050> top

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 

I'm<00:00:40.380> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> line<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> Timbers<00:00:41.520> such<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I'm going to line the Timbers such that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.240 
I'm going to line the Timbers such that
the<00:00:42.390> center<00:00:42.990> of<00:00:43.080> this<00:00:43.200> plate<00:00:43.590> between<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.100> two

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the center of this plate between the two

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.060 
the center of this plate between the two
spikes<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.360> directly<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> foot<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.800> much

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
spikes is directly over the foot as much

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:02.810 
spikes is directly over the foot as much
as<00:00:47.220> possible<00:00:48.680> bring<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.890> second<00:00:50.310> timber<00:00:50.610> now

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 

and<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> sits<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.050> there<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and again it sits in there and now it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.620 
and again it sits in there and now it
will<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:06.000> self<00:01:06.390> align<00:01:06.750> itself<00:01:11.090> when<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.120> place

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
will all self align itself when we place

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.390 
will all self align itself when we place
the<00:01:12.840> tray<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> tree<00:01:16.830> goes<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the tray so the tree goes into the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.170 
the tray so the tree goes into the
center<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:22.440> tray<00:01:22.680> should<00:01:22.860> end<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.280> even

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
center of the tray should end up even

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630 
center of the tray should end up even
with<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> ends<00:01:24.870> on<00:01:25.080> both<00:01:25.260> sides<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with the ends on both sides and then you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240 
with the ends on both sides and then you
just<00:01:26.910> pull<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:27.990> together<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.800> them<00:01:28.920> tight

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
just pull these together make them tight

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:59.030 
just pull these together make them tight
when<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.210> close<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:31.290> creates<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.710> train

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.070 

it<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:06.090> essentially<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.240> no<00:02:07.420> fingerprints

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it is essentially have no fingerprints

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:17.910 
it is essentially have no fingerprints
if<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.290> don't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.190 

pretty<00:02:18.920> evenly<00:02:19.810> next<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> got<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.200> rails

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
pretty evenly next you got the rails

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.960 
pretty evenly next you got the rails
this<00:02:24.200> rail<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.620> uh<00:02:24.650> as<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.519> can<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:25.849> got

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
this rail is uh as you can see it's got

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.890 
this rail is uh as you can see it's got
the<00:02:26.000> brand<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.599> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the brand on it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.589 
the brand on it
Carnegie<00:02:27.739> 1900<00:02:28.430> I'm<00:02:28.879> gonna<00:02:29.060> put<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.360> one<00:02:29.540> on

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
Carnegie 1900 I'm gonna put this one on

Carnegie 1900 I'm gonna put this one on
the<00:02:29.720> outside<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:31.310> rails<00:02:31.489> are

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the outside the rails are

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.650 
the outside the rails are
interchangeable

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
interchangeable

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.880 
interchangeable

brand on the inside or on the outside of
their<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.560> possible<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> do<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:54.360> little<00:02:55.360> bit

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
their it's possible to do a little bit

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.910 
their it's possible to do a little bit
of<00:02:55.540> overhang<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.200> outside<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.800> these

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
of overhang on the outside of these

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.630 
of overhang on the outside of these
should<00:02:57.550> be<00:02:57.580> about<00:02:57.880> two<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.810> three<00:02:58.840> inches

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
should be about two to three inches

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.300 
should be about two to three inches
right<00:03:00.640> at<00:03:00.760> 3<00:03:01.030> inches<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:01.630> both<00:03:02.410> sides<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
right at 3 inches on both sides the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.500 
right at 3 inches on both sides the
artifacts<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.300> place<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.880> then

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
artifacts that go in place and then

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:23.370 
artifacts that go in place and then
we've<00:03:13.630> got<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.989> bumpers<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:23.350> I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
we've got the bumpers go on but I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.840 
we've got the bumpers go on but I
generally<00:03:23.680> put<00:03:23.800> two<00:03:24.160> here<00:03:24.660> two<00:03:25.660> here<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
generally put two here two here just to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.759 
generally put two here two here just to
give<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.060> enough<00:03:28.239> height<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:29.140> rail<00:03:29.350> hasn't

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
give it enough height the rail hasn't

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.150 
give it enough height the rail hasn't
arkin<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:32.440> want<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> be<00:03:32.709> sure<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.010> get

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
arkin it so you want to be sure you get

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.100 
arkin it so you want to be sure you get
that<00:03:33.280> edge<00:03:33.459> with<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.880> top<00:03:34.269> part<00:03:34.510> they<00:03:34.690> are<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
that edge with the top part they are and

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.110 
that edge with the top part they are and
the<00:03:35.830> rails<00:03:36.040> because<00:03:36.220> they<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:36.700> used<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.090> can

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
the rails because they are used they can

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.090 
the rails because they are used they can
vary<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.530> will<00:03:38.829> need<00:03:38.950> those

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
vary a little bit so you will need those

00:03:39.100 --> 00:04:04.230 
vary a little bit so you will need those
spacers<00:03:39.579> in<00:03:39.730> order<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.940> get<00:03:40.060> your<00:03:40.209> glass<00:03:40.390> low
