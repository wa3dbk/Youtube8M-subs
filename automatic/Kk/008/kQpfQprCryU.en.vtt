00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
think this one is am like a side leaves

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
think this one is am like a side leaves
thing<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.280> further<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.180> look<00:01:18.299> some

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
thing and further down here we look some

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.130 
thing and further down here we look some
more<00:01:18.750> tomato<00:01:19.650> plants<00:01:20.130> tearing<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> go

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
more tomato plants tearing up on the go

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280 
more tomato plants tearing up on the go
so<00:01:22.310> things<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.700> definitely<00:01:24.450> happening<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so things are definitely happening the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.210 
so things are definitely happening the
radish<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.650> by<00:01:25.950> far<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:28.530> best<00:01:28.740> best

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
radish is by far the the the best best

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
radish is by far the the the best best
looking<00:01:29.549> ones<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> moment<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.299> did<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
looking ones at the moment I did make a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
looking ones at the moment I did make a
few<00:01:31.530> alterations<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.000> initial

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
few alterations to the initial

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
few alterations to the initial
hydroponics<00:01:35.270> setup<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.659> may<00:01:36.960> have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
hydroponics setup that you may have

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.410 
hydroponics setup that you may have
remember<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:39.030> using<00:01:39.180> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
remember that I did I was using this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
remember that I did I was using this
this<00:01:39.600> sort<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> guttering<00:01:40.409> stuff<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this sort of guttering stuff right the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
this sort of guttering stuff right the
way<00:01:41.460> across<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:42.270> completely<00:01:42.750> given<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.290> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
way across well completely given up with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.690 
way across well completely given up with
that<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.070> using<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that now and what I'm using is the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.230 
that now and what I'm using is the
blocks<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.180> rock<00:01:45.360> wall<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
blocks of rock wall and that it's just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
blocks of rock wall and that it's just
basically<00:01:48.540> they're<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> blocks<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.220> way

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
basically they're the blocks the way

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
basically they're the blocks the way
they're<00:01:50.549> spaced<00:01:50.759> together<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.750> what's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
they're spaced together is what's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.359 
they're spaced together is what's
actually<00:01:53.040> supporting<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.750> plastic<00:01:55.369> I've

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
actually supporting the the plastic I've

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.170 
actually supporting the the plastic I've
done<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.880> change<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.810> far<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.180> solution

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
done one change so far of the solution

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.749 
done one change so far of the solution
and<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.040> probably<00:02:02.219> hear<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.670> I've

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and also you can probably hear that I've

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.899 
and also you can probably hear that I've
got<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.560> got<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> air<00:02:04.799> pump<00:02:05.040> running<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
got the got the air pump running now and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.760 
got the got the air pump running now and
hopefully<00:02:07.130> you'll<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.579> let<00:02:09.420> me<00:02:09.479> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
hopefully you'll see that let me just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.230 
hopefully you'll see that let me just
yeah<00:02:11.520> yeah<00:02:11.790> we've<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:14.030> four<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> half

for whatever reason it might be just due

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150

space<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:53.400> system<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.390> combat<00:02:54.960> them<00:02:55.250> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
space in this system to combat them so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070 
space in this system to combat them so
I've<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:56.580> taken<00:02:57.000> some<00:02:57.300> advice<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.780> can't

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
including the the mylar backing strip

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.330 
including the the mylar backing strip
and<00:03:06.240> that's<00:03:06.660> helped<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.230> sort<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.740> reflect<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340

and that's helped to sort of reflect the
light<00:03:08.520> onto<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.970> punch<00:03:09.270> from<00:03:09.510> both

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
light onto the punch from both

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.930 
light onto the punch from both
