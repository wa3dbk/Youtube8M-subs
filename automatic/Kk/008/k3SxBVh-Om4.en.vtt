00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
lump on that roundabout just goes to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.230 
lump on that roundabout just goes to
show<00:00:22.160> long<00:00:22.430> gazes<00:00:22.640> we've<00:00:23.029> been<00:00:23.180> down<00:00:23.360> here

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.310 

as<00:00:37.220> long<00:00:37.460> as<00:00:37.490> you<00:00:37.760> apply<00:00:37.970> roundabout<00:00:38.660> rules<00:00:38.960> to

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
as long as you apply roundabout rules to

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.310 
as long as you apply roundabout rules to
the<00:00:39.440> junction<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.100> shouldn't<00:00:40.430> matter<00:00:41.320> that's

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
the junction it shouldn't matter that's

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.110 
the junction it shouldn't matter that's
the<00:00:42.470> whole<00:00:42.620> idea<00:00:42.650> of<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.220> mini<00:00:43.400> roundabout<00:00:43.940> it

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
the whole idea of a mini roundabout it

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.820 
the whole idea of a mini roundabout it
doesn't<00:00:44.360> say<00:00:44.540> you've<00:00:44.720> got<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.080> go<00:00:45.230> round<00:00:45.500> it

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
doesn't say you've got to go round it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.620 
doesn't say you've got to go round it
you've<00:00:46.520> got<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.880> treat<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.150> as<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.510> roundabout

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
you've got to treat it as a roundabout

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.000 
you've got to treat it as a roundabout
the<00:00:50.630> rut<00:00:50.840> roundabout<00:00:51.350> rules<00:00:51.620> even<00:00:51.890> though

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
the rut roundabout rules even though

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.920 
the rut roundabout rules even though
it's<00:00:52.160> only<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.340> very<00:00:52.489> small<00:00:52.820> thing<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.809> can

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's only a very small thing you can

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
certain I can go over it as long as it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
certain I can go over it as long as it's
your<00:00:56.570> turn<00:00:58.570> but<00:00:59.570> that's<00:00:59.750> got<00:00:59.900> a<00:00:59.960> big<00:01:00.110> bloody

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
you can go through on red and it doesn't

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.859 
you can go through on red and it doesn't
matter<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:50.009> seems<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.459> be<00:01:50.490> okay<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.750> if
