hi everyone Kremlin here for the techies

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.990 
hi everyone Kremlin here for the techies
today<00:00:07.529> I'm<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.160> showing<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.089 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
apply<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.750> basic<00:00:10.290> map<00:00:10.860> onto<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.840> object<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.290> 3ds

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
apply a basic map onto a object in 3ds

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
apply a basic map onto a object in 3ds
max<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> demonstrate<00:00:15.570> I'm<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> be

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
max so to demonstrate I'm going to be

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.060 
max so to demonstrate I'm going to be
turning<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:18.170> sphere<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.470> something<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
turning a sphere into something that

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
turning a sphere into something that
looks<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.939> earth<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
looks like the earth so we're going to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.230 
looks like the earth so we're going to
go<00:00:22.769> home<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.039> head<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.789> our<00:00:23.939> sphere

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
go home and head and make our sphere

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120 
go home and head and make our sphere
here<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.869> doesn't<00:00:25.230> matter<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.529> color<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
here it doesn't matter what color it is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.279 
here it doesn't matter what color it is
right<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.490> we're<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> change<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.289> to

right now we're going to change that to
edit<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> texture<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> color<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
edit the texture of it and color and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.799 
edit the texture of it and color and
stuff<00:00:31.170> press<00:00:32.040> em<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.579> keyboard<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.149> this

preview of your map up here now all we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
preview of your map up here now all we
need<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.979> drag<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.299> the

get this lovely image but as you see now
this<00:01:22.259> map<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> scene<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:25.170> high

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this map in the scene is not very high

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
this map in the scene is not very high
resolution<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.430> everything's<00:01:26.970> blurry

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
resolution at all everything's blurry

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170 
resolution at all everything's blurry
even<00:01:28.020> though<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.439> map<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> imported<00:01:30.030> was

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
even though my map that I imported was

even though my map that I imported was
high<00:01:30.360> resolution<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.479> error<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
high resolution this is not an error it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
high resolution this is not an error it
is<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> way<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.369> program<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.939> save

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
is just a way for the program to save

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
is just a way for the program to save
space<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.930> scene<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.369> things<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
space in your scene so that things don't

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.749 
space in your scene so that things don't
lag<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.840> slow<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> view<00:01:41.640> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
lag and it's not slow but to view what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
lag and it's not slow but to view what
it's<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> look<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it's really going to look like with the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's really going to look like with the
map<00:01:43.590> proper<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.399> proper<00:01:44.729> resolution<00:01:45.060> go

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
map proper with proper resolution go

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.380 
map proper with proper resolution go
ahead<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> press<00:01:47.009> render<00:01:47.310> production<00:01:47.970> button

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
ahead and press render production button

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
ahead and press render production button
and<00:01:48.600> you'll<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> preview<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and you'll get this preview what it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
and you'll get this preview what it
really<00:01:50.820> looks<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.259> is

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
really looks like so you can see that is

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
really looks like so you can see that is
pretty<00:01:52.860> good<00:01:53.070> resolution<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.840> final

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
pretty good resolution in the final

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.340 
pretty good resolution in the final
product<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.329> pretty<00:01:57.689> much<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> there's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
product so that's pretty much it there's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
product so that's pretty much it there's
a<00:01:58.439> whole<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.159> different<00:01:59.700> kinds<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.210> things

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
a whole lot of different kinds of things

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.969 
a whole lot of different kinds of things
