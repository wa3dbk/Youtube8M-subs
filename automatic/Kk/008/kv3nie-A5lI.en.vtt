Baldwin in the abdomen here so it is

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
Baldwin in the abdomen here so it is
somewhat<00:01:31.200> restricted<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> shirt

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
somewhat restricted because of the shirt

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010

too<00:01:35.729> restrictive<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.630> too<00:01:36.840> much

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
too restrictive for you to get too much

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
too restrictive for you to get too much
motion<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> adds<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
motion all of that but it adds a bit so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910
