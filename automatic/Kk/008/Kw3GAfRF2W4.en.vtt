00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.120
 good to everyone I am arctic and we are here 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.249
 in a new video we are again in 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.769
 sky wars let's take a little game 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:12.889
 fast because I have something very important 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.110
 to tell you, I suppose you will have already 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.410
 made an idea with the title not also 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.120
 I told you very few videos 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.630
 really since I told you that is what 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.660
 I was going to do and well I guess you 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.540
 you will remember one day I told you there is a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.260
 very good looking server very good 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:37.160
 constructions and that will open soon 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.960
 that server is edith and different in 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.570
 this server that we will find then 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.630
 we have several game modes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.220
 annihilation free for all bridges 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.220
 skyworks tnt run and go for recipe 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.270
 then we will go deeper into day 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.310
 opening 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.420
 finally the server will open the 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.270
 Saturday , February 21 is Saturday 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.090
 of the next week according this 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.119
 not the one next week here now 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.159
 at 6 o'clock in the afternoon - Spanish time - of 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.859
 according to that time you can already 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.560
 all in bed and 1.8 premium server 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.600
 very simple agreement is typical 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 You know almost all 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.090
 servers nowadays already have the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.939
 version 1.8 the last one so perfect 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 we will not have any kind of complication 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.579
 to enter to play about premium is what 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.500
 that there are guys you already know what to do 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.619
 non-premium server usually brings 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.179
 many problems only need to see 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.979
 the experience that people have had 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.170
 who has tried and usually not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.189
 they leave nothing good from the servers not 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.289
 premium since it is very easy to hack the 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.789
 destroy them and it usually does not go well 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.600
 that I really think is a good 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.900
 news that a premium server comes out 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 to ip addresses web address teams pib 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.390
 If we have tips, we can go in there 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.009
 to chat to tell us our things and 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.080
 Also be sure jasmines 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.880
 out there quite frequently in case 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.250
 you have any problem you can 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.280
 attend there address of the page 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.959
 dif dot net web is not yet active 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.180
 in agreement you can enter you will see a 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.060
 cover very cool with there your lyrics and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.310
 your logo but you can not enter yet the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.780
 day 21 will open together with the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.690
 server 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.930
 the server now that we talk about him what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.569
 ip address has very simple mc 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.900
 dot net the 'times' pib you can 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.350
 imagine we follow the same tonic ps 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.959
 edi punto net I love it all 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.260
 so simple many times it happens to me that 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.030
 I say to see stop thinking this ip as 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.130
 It was on this server I do not remember 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.350
 they have this name so weird that if one 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.080
 it gets deep in front that if others 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.050
 they have us that if others have us not 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.769
 not here simple that is minecraft then 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.739
 mc castings and ps is already simple and 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.000
 simple what has to be team of 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.590
 I told you that construction 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.750
 they loved the constructions that they had 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.790
 this server and it's no wonder I'm going 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.370
 to put here a few images here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.950
 in the background while I'm telling this the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.540
 construction team is build team 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.100
 star you will have the twitter here 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.500
 appearing on the screen while leaving 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.140
 the three images this this here is 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.640
 the skyworks hub is very cool is the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
 lobby so we can get an idea 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 where you wait for friends 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.180
 to then all united to the same 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.609
 heading then there 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.819
 this is the skywork arena one of them 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.950
 so a photo a bit mysterious to 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.810
 do not disclose too much until day 21 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.989
 you will have to put up with it because you can not 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.030
 see too much more is already and then by 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.760
 last we have the annihilation islands 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.920
 that I have not played personally but 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.500
 I really want to try this mode 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.810
 of game we will go into more detail 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.950
 now already to the game modes because 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 I have told you a little bit everything 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.430
 interesting and all the essentials of 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.370
 this server good constructions 1.8 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.799
 premium opening on the 21th we are only missing 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.650
 the game modes we will have in first 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.720
 place some annihilation arenas 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.889
 I remember annihilation is a way of 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.620
 game in case you do not know it has 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.709
 informed a little bit is like destroying the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.139
 nexus is worth the same there to hosts 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.720
 secondly free for all in case not 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.530
 you know english basically all against 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.340
 everyone 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.669
 pvp to the beast without equipment without anything one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.790
 against one and the one you win against the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.210
 rest 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.240
 and you all know against all bridges or 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.710
 bridges depending on how you know or 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.000
 as you know it, you do not know 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 depending on the servers to which 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.450
 enter will be translated or is not that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 game mode in which several 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.770
 islands with some equipment in them and 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.570
 then once we have these teams in 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.790
 the islands begin to collect 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.580
 minerals and to build swords 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.770
 armor whatever so that in the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.990
 a minute bridges appear 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.630
 between the islands and they can start 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.580
 sticking very interesting although maybe a 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.470
 little too long to record but 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.680
 to play without recording I'm sure that 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.720
 It's really fun and then we're in 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.770
 the final stretch the last 3,000 games 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.110
 in my opinion the best skyworks and 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.700
 we all know what skybox is a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.360
 past of mini - games you know that to me 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.460
 this 2015 has given me strong for playing 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.110
 sky wars and I think the sands that we 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.470
 will have prepared will be awesome 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.380
 because I've seen some and really very 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.120
 good job so sure they are very 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.180
 funny 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.940
 and really want to play there later 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.070
 we continue with tnt run I also have 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.870
 very curious to know what they get 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.580
 do with tnt run 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.169
 I have not seen absolutely any of this 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.270
 so I do not know what the 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.120
 arenas or how the minigame will work 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.070
 if you will have some extra things or not and already 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.990
 We'll see it on the 21st. I'll be there to 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.900
 check it because I really want to 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.990
 see if they can give me back the desire 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.490
 for playing tnt run and last but not 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.530
 less important a mini game that 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.830
 I have never tried either but that 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.020
 attracts a lot is vampire z 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.670
 this minigame been looking at what's going 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.340
 and basically it 's like an infected 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.310
 call of duty vale starts all the people 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.400
 being human and one being the infected 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.800
 or in this case the vampire this person 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.380
 he has to try to kill the humans 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.780
 for them to convert to their team is 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.240
 say if the vampire kills a human that 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.010
 human is transformed into a vampire by 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.810
 so in this way we have a limit 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.300
 of time in which vampires have 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.340
 that get converted to all 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.740
 human beings, on the other hand, have to 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.450
 try to resist and then do 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.430
 barricades for those who can not 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.440
 convert them and charge so many 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.110
 Vampires as they can to prevent 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.460
 they can kill them so I 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.160
 it seems a game mode very very 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.260
 interesting to which I want to play we go the 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.690
 opening day the first day I want 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.700
 prove this sure it has to be a 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.440
 pass 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.170
 and well I think that this is all that 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.030
 I could tell you about vidic really the 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.060
 administrators, I can say that they are 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.700
 super friendly I talked to them and 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.040
 they are really very good people and that 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.170
 have been preparing this a lot 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.710
 that they deserve a great success 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.140
 that 21 day long building 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.600
 a lot of time preparing plugins a lot 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.750
 time thinking ideas I think that 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.520
 really yes they deserve this so 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.710
 I said all this, I think I 've already 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.180
 I left my opinion quite clear 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.610
 about this server really 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.160
 awesome, really looking forward to it 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.140
 open and I hope there at all 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.970
 surely I will occasionally some 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.780
 direct or something to go playing around 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.810
 so they are very attentive to my twitter and 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.950

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.050
