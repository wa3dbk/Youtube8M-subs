00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello everyone again ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.099
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha good first that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.990
 nothing, let's analyze something that I thought was a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.090
 half ridiculous that were some 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 comments that put me on my last 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.190
 video to see let's see what is there to see 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.430
 see shit thanks I uploaded the video yesterday and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.619
 already has about 180 visits but that's not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 be a lot but my first video they saw 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.779
 like eight people in a week thanks 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.029
 good pussy already here I'm seeing a 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 comment that I found weird let's see 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.969
 I see it I like women I walk 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.340
 here I see a misspelling had 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.680
 sexual desires with women I am a man 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 but I can not explain why I see my 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 little pony is I came out very well 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 English pronunciation is like that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.340
 It captures well what I do not understand 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.980
 this comment is because it tells me 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 like in a challenging tone it 's like 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.100
 that I would have said that those who see badly 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.160
 and bulfoni are fags 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.800
 I did not say that because you are so offensive 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.809
 when I put the chuck norris and said those 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 things was like to make a joke and not 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.450
 leave the video this dry seriously not 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.119
 they are offended so much fuck what happens to them 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.580
 well here I found another comment that 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.039
 I found it distasteful that it is the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.020
 first of all, you are very sexy and you 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.570
 loquendo of 'resident evil' was the best 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.520
 loquendo that I saw in all my life but the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.680
 this loquendo's theme seems taken out of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.600
 television already damaged 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.149
 first of all, how good it is that you have 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.220
 liked my video of 'resident evil' I think 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.560
 that was one of the best videos I 've ever 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.869
 done but what is the problem with that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.909
 make a video of what I want if I 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.100
 I want to make a video of how it dries 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.319
 the painting is my channel and I upload what I 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.810
 It beats apart maybe you can not 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.940
 like the subject of the video but I think 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.429
 many yes so do not put yourself in that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.590
 plan feel calm that I'm not going either 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.899
 to speak ill of the good series already 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.270
 let's stop talking shit and start with 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.640
 the video the first thing is that I'm not going to 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 speak ill of the series I think it is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.770
 a very good and recommended series 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.190
 the question that everyone has already I am a 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.750
 brownie because I'm sorry but no longer 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.610
 of why the many 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.860
 men like this series and do not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.080
 I share your criteria and at least 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.750
 five chapters and I already think it's 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.760
 enough I will not see a season 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.610
 whole of that fuck pod do not make me 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.920
 that if I do not like it I do not like it 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.480
 it's about ponies it's obviously a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.400
 series like any other that has 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.980
 aired on cartoon network or 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 disney chanel mainly disney 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 chanel if I had to put it in a 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.720
 I put the channel in disney chanel or in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 cartoon network what is it good about not 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.099
 I can tell you what it is about 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.230
 series of varied topics is as I said 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.780
 any series did not find anything of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.450
 magic below I will define the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.370
 characters excuse me what happens is 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.530
 I saw her in English and I do not know the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.079
 names in Spanish the first one is 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.489
 twilight sparkle which is basically the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.709
 prota of the series 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.530
 this is a studious polis that likes 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.900
 read and all that other is applejack which is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.090
 'one put something like a ranch is 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.420
 something stale but it has its sides 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.739
 and another is his terrible forgiveness is that he 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.819
 I forgot the name and I had to 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.370
 invent something 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.980
 this is one I put something shy but 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.590
 strong when this pony is necessary it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 it looks a lot like gina is another is rainbow 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.250
 das is putting as well as acorn 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.260
 the super power girls pink and pay 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.599
 this is a put something hyperactive speech 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.150
 a lot and also fast but it's the one 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.190
 funniest meeting of all and the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.140
 last one I forgot completely the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.269
 name is something like the fashionista 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 he likes to be fashionable and so on 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.829
 etcetera as I saw out there that people 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 he likes the series because they feel 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.170
 identified with the characters that is 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.110
 pure shit I do not identify with any 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.660
 I am not very reader or scholar 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.299
 I like the field, I'm not athletic, I'm not 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.640
 shy I'm not addicted to sugar and I do not 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.280
 like fashion so do not come with me 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.840
 that excuse that apart from it sounds gay to have a 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.120
 character that I feel 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.640
 identified have seen the movie that 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.470
 of the penguins that draw good in 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.959
 that movie there is a chicken that always 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.630
 It's half chilling and quiet 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.519
 with that character I identify myself but not 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.310
 How can a man feel 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.889
 identified by a good pony since I 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.599
 I leave the subject we will see a little more 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.970
 within the series to decipher the 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.190
 Why men see this series 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.190
 it's disguised as a girl's theme but 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.500
 it's not like this is a unisex series for kids 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.020
 and girls something like the girls 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.330
 the superpowers the characters 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.210
 the main ones are girls but still the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.940
 the creator saw both boys and girls 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.800
 so to speak of the series lauren faust 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.500
 I wanted to break the stereotype that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.419
 it was something for girls and it was achieved by 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.430
 applause for lauren transformed 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.400
 successfully a series of girls to a 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.139
 series that everyone can enjoy 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.900
 but the reason why so many people 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.849
 Like it's simple, it's not because I have a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.000
 thematic good and novel and because blah 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.900
 blah blah of friendship do not fuck with 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.729
 that 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.009
 in fact Lauren is also the creator 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.229
 together with her husband she believed mccracken of 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.210
 the superpowerful girls and what for 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.669
 I was one of the best series of my 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.409
 childhood the foster mansion for friends 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.599
 imaginary 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.669
 then the mind behind my little 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.399
 pony is the same one that is behind those 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.889
 two works of art my little pony is a 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:35.019
 good series and point I like so much 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.809
 because it's so much better than all the shit 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:39.279
 who is currently on television 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:42.759
 how much shit there is not currently in the 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.319
 television a lot then they have created 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.050
 a series that has everything we saw 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.569
 before it has grace not like everything 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.489
 is currently on television now 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.339
 that I like to like so much for 

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:57.069
 volverme not old joke is too big for me 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:00.369
 the title is a series for children from 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.009
 at least 13 years than some manganzones of 18 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.719
 years see that pod it tastes like ass and it's not 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.879
 that they see it only is that 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.979
 autonomize as brownies or 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.749
 fans of miley bull pony 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.729
 I like the foster mansion for 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.709
 imaginary friends but I'm not going to 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.769
 put to see episode by episode in the 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.779
 pc if they pass an episode through the tv maybe 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.939
 I see it but I will not do that to see 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.550
 entire seasons in a single day of 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.039
 the series is how it should be with 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.409
 my little pony and because I do not like 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.740
 well while I saw it I thought it was a 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.630
 series 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.910
 but at some time or another always 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.580
 They came out with some sailor and took me 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.860
 the whole wave in conclusion my little 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.560
 pony is something like sailor moon but 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.349
 in cartoons girls can see it 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.720
 like children but I still know weird that 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:48.550
 see her men of legal age and good 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.849
 that's why the laughs at the beginning of 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.440
 video I'm immune wing bronze 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.440
 have a good night, chau
