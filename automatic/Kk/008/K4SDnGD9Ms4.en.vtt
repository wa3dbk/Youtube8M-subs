00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 every song pc-max we have this time 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 something out of the house cool master there and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.619
 Although this is the case often 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 sam 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.830
 as the name suggests fx m the whole 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.869
 based on the very successful 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 littered for quite some time on the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 market and marketed as backdoor 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.010
 was named hex hex emse 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 thus the medica variant is and should 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.949
 with the same equipment features as well 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.780
 the performance points 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.380
 if this is really the case we show you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.140
 our short video on the connection side 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.300
 the perfect two usb 2.0 sockets 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.780
 second generation as well as two of the new ones 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.719
 usb 3.0 generation as well audio in out 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 above find the reset switch 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 and a switch for the front fan 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 led and the on and off switch of 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 On the outside, there are three in total 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.350
 5.25 inch drives install like dvd 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.810
 burner or fan control underneath 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.439
 perrot function two 3.5 inches 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 hard disks and a big one at the bottom 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.409
 ranch partie under which factory-a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.070
 230 mm fan hides and also 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.479
 is interchangeable 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 and here again the view with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.409
 taken off after frontpart over 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 denounces a big mac partie that 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.920
 perfect front the shelf for eventual 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 little things like usb sticks and just 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 the three switches include the top 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 make a 200 mm propeller which resp 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.670
 which is also due to three of the 120 mm 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.799
 or 140mm format can replace the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.250
 Just taken top cover can be 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.210
 remove with a small screw 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.909
 below are three 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.079
 hose feedthroughs left the archive 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.360
 of the mainboard then to the right of it ex factory 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.160
 a 140 mm fan also through 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 120 millimeter model exchange 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.680
 continue to be one of them 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 and that is the ninth is vertical 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.440
 arranged and at the bottom of the finds 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.340
 Power supply usually be the place 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.570
 Side parts will screw over pensions 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.460
 attached or 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.290
 the right side part from here 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.850
 seen and looked at by that 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.780
 left is about a special one 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.760
 open mechanism 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.840
 Now we have the complete interior view 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.660
 therefore grows despite the format of one 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.970
 mediators considerable finds determined 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.100
 also one or the other home 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.350
 configuration including water cool country 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.170
 but first we go too 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.890
 essential for the cabinet is a let 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.140
 to install three 5.25 inch drives 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.060
 underneath we have 2 3 5 inch bays 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.930
 we have called too early 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.340
 6 drives internally can be installed 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.540
 So 3 5 inch plates or 2 5 inch SSDS 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 To the left of this we have a power supply 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 blind the ugly cables hidden eight 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.700
 countries have administrative cards 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.709
 above it a 140 mm profile ex works 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 the warm exhaust air blows out 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.790
 large or 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.590
 big hole in the mainboard tray allowed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080
 changing the processor cooler and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.180
 that gummed uncomplicated 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.080
 Cable glands allow clean of the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.959
 cable management, and that was the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.700
 most necessary of the housing interior a view 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.400
 on the case bottom this is 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.220
 held comparatively unspectacular 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.470
 all elements and riveted at the bottom 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.870
 just the filter from the inside 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.739
 slimming makes the whole housing stands 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:00.690
 on gummed or decoupled 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.850
 Aluminum feet above this is the front 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.250
 is the trough around the front 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.720
 to decrease 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.760
 his housing pioneer has cool master 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.580
 everything done right the newest 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.790
 sprout from the high flow series may well 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.680
 convince that sex he already 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.739
 Success was now becoming potent 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.700
 further developed and reduced 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.900
 in no case were scaled down, however 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.389
 the equipment features and the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.449
 performance of these are 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.099
 similar to the fx 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.379
 So really a successful 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.509
 successor of the fx wise smaller brother 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.210
 which can certainly be seen 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.710
 all the ones that make the heks smaller 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.020
 Wish you are here with good 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.029
 advise who martialische housing 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.650
 with good performance and one 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.889
 reasonable price performance ratio 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 addiction could be more accurate 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.370
 look at
