00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 the continuation of the roller swinging 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.160
 broken pushers on one-two-three on 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 the third cylinder is our 5, he stood 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.699
 what happened to him means one of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.170
 the reasons that we got it 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.170
 I see on the camshaft 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.170
 So 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.400
 cam destruction happens right here 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:39.610
 it can be seen on the camshaft 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 then visually you can look at 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.800
 from above it is not very visible so not very 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.640
 say so much increased here 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.640
 storage size nearby 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.750
 difficult 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.989
 it's hard to say more precisely the language is not 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.430
 turns and what's on the pusher 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:10.450
 who was standing there we see pushers we 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 We see that the puck is also destroyed 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.920
 what was originally either cam 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.979
 any cam or puck hard to say 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 but now the pusher now he already has 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.369
 such a form 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.300
 it is compressed on the sides turned out that's what that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.460
 so here it is the irregular shape of Jade 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.460
 the sides if we leave there in place 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.510
 here he is swinging 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.370
 proshka saved as neighboring 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:55.600
 he will swing too 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.460
 take another pusher you and put 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 turret is so here we are 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.320
 Let's put a jumbo plump if here 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.980
 we put in general, too 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.980
 plump but 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 nickname shake honestly say 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 saw a lot of heads and suspensive 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.170
 can even more 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.849
 probably have to change the head 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.710
 so after the wear is stronger 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.710
 On the sides
