Pender's but we're from so yeah I'll
just<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.770> over<00:00:19.800> explaining<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.700> grip<00:00:21.690> on<00:00:21.870> this

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
just go over explaining the grip on this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.250 
just go over explaining the grip on this
deck<00:00:22.290> first<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.720> what<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.110> do

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
deck first so what do you know what do

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.450 
deck first so what do you know what do
as<00:00:26.600> baby<00:00:27.770> if<00:00:28.770> you<00:00:28.890> don't<00:00:28.950> need<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> kind<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
as baby if you don't need a kind of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
as baby if you don't need a kind of
basic<00:00:29.760> physics<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> engineering<00:00:30.330> then

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
basic physics and engineering then

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.350 
basic physics and engineering then
you'll<00:00:31.440> know<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.950> route<00:00:32.400> and<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> waiver

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
you'll know a route and in a waiver

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.650 
you'll know a route and in a waiver
system<00:00:36.680> where<00:00:37.680> you've<00:00:37.830> got<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:39.270> flavor

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
system where you've got like your flavor

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
system where you've got like your flavor
flavor<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> point

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.709 

that's<00:00:45.809> another<00:00:46.050> point<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.030> say<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that's another point and we can say that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.069 
that's another point and we can say that
quest<00:00:49.020> spends<00:00:49.860> cut<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> point<00:00:51.079> same

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
quest spends cut at that point same

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.280 
quest spends cut at that point same
thing<00:00:52.260> when<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.440> holding<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.739> stack<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
thing when you're holding a stack and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.450 
thing when you're holding a stack and
except<00:00:55.290> instead<00:00:55.769> of<00:00:55.860> having<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> purple

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
except instead of having the purple

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.950 
except instead of having the purple
underneath<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> fart<00:00:57.269> you've<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> top

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
underneath of the fart you've got on top

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
underneath of the fart you've got on top
so<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.040> your<00:00:59.250> thumb<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.540> even<00:01:00.660> have

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so that's your thumb you can even have

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240 
so that's your thumb you can even have
if<00:01:01.110> you're<00:01:01.230> looking<00:01:01.440> down<00:01:01.470> it<00:01:01.860> will<00:01:02.010> look<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
if you're looking down it will look like

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
if you're looking down it will look like
that<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.329> thumb<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.720> facing<00:01:04.290> up

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that with your thumb actually facing up

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.999 
that with your thumb actually facing up
so<00:01:05.360> yeah<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.600> fits<00:01:06.869> around<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.530> if

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
so yeah it fits around there because if

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.859 
so yeah it fits around there because if
you<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> actual<00:01:08.729> motion<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.690> up

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you think about the actual motion is up

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.930 
you think about the actual motion is up
and<00:01:10.050> down<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.259> that<00:01:10.430> that's<00:01:11.430> why<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.580> used<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
and down like that that's why I used to

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.609 
and down like that that's why I used to
do<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.420> would<00:01:12.690> plead<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> best<00:01:13.320> part<00:01:13.530> -

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
do is I would plead with the best part -

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
do is I would plead with the best part -
they<00:01:13.890> stand<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.220> water<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.550> more<00:01:14.970> towards

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
they stand up water like more towards

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.279 
they stand up water like more towards
the<00:01:16.380> upper<00:01:16.770> direction<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.910> my<00:01:18.030> thumb<00:01:18.179> was<00:01:18.390> so

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
the upper direction than my thumb was so

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.070 
the upper direction than my thumb was so
I<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.679> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.039> playing<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.080> which

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
I was kind of playing like this which

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.180 
I was kind of playing like this which
isn't<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.289> very<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:22.679> because<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> build

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
isn't really very good because you build

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.040 
isn't really very good because you build
a<00:01:23.280> fulcrum<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.149> st.<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.660> stacking

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
a fulcrum on the st. and the stacking

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.719 
a fulcrum on the st. and the stacking
stand<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:25.979> help<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:32.009> yeah

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
stand which doesn't really help but yeah

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
stand which doesn't really help but yeah
so<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.539> what<00:01:33.660> you<00:01:33.780> wanted<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.830> your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so that's what you wanted as your

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
so that's what you wanted as your
hopeless<00:01:35.310> deck<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.149> should<00:01:36.330> probably<00:01:36.539> hold

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
hopeless deck you should probably hold

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
hopeless deck you should probably hold
up<00:01:37.110> hany<00:01:37.830> wee<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.310> further<00:01:38.729> forward<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.300> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
up hany wee bit further forward and you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
up hany wee bit further forward and you
would<00:01:39.600> normally<00:01:39.929> hold<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.130> was

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
would normally hold it because I was

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
would normally hold it because I was
going<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.550> like<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.940> thought<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.360> were

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
going over like you thought we were

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
going over like you thought we were
thinking<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.319> just<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> kind

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
thinking out there but then just to kind

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.130 
thinking out there but then just to kind
of<00:01:44.460> speed<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> technique<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:45.840> does

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of speed up the technique it does

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
of speed up the technique it does
compensate<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.970> power<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.509> yeah<00:01:51.570> mix

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
compensate and from power and yeah mix

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
compensate and from power and yeah mix
it<00:01:51.960> makes<00:01:52.560> he<00:01:52.680> had<00:01:52.860> slightly<00:01:53.509> softer<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it makes he had slightly softer than you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
it makes he had slightly softer than you
would<00:01:54.899> normally<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.850> can't<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> back

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
would normally and you can't do the back

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
would normally and you can't do the back
in<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.720> here<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> had<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.380> hard<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
in it here and it had really hard be

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
in it here and it had really hard be
able<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> go

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
able to go

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.420 
able to go
sluggish<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.020> there's<00:02:01.650> nothing<00:02:02.040> within<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
sluggish so there's nothing within the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
sluggish so there's nothing within the
balance<00:02:02.730> point<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.450> keep<00:02:03.600> spending<00:02:03.870> this

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
balance point so I keep spending this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.570 
balance point so I keep spending this
step<00:02:05.870> but<00:02:06.870> yet<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.800> you<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.070> fennec<00:02:08.310> balance

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
step but yet so you got a fennec balance

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.030 
step but yet so you got a fennec balance
point<00:02:08.790> it's<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.300> their<00:02:10.080> style<00:02:10.350> in<00:02:10.649> speed<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
point it's just their style in speed and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.910 
point it's just their style in speed and
power<00:02:11.190> same<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.850> with<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.840> drum<00:02:12.990> pedals<00:02:13.260> but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
power same as with the drum pedals but

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.430 
power same as with the drum pedals but
this<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.340> great<00:02:14.520> little<00:02:14.670> bass

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
this is a really great little bass

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.810 
this is a really great little bass
yes<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.680> waiting<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.010> point<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.580> then

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
yes I'm just waiting my point and then

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:26.330 
yes I'm just waiting my point and then
hold<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.330> thee<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:24.650> basic<00:02:25.650> motion<00:02:26.010> really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
hold on to thee so basic motion really

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:35.540 
hold on to thee so basic motion really
slowly<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:33.770> as<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
slowly as like this as you can see the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.190 
slowly as like this as you can see the
sticks<00:02:35.820> puffing<00:02:36.180> around<00:02:36.300> my<00:02:36.510> thumb<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.900> said

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
sticks puffing around my thumb I said

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
sticks puffing around my thumb I said
earlier<00:02:37.530> acts<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.860> good<00:02:38.010> talk<00:02:38.220> removes<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.760> top

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
earlier acts a good talk removes on top

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.180 
earlier acts a good talk removes on top
as<00:02:39.750> opposed<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> site<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.740> they<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.920> used<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
as opposed to the site so they I used to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.780 
as opposed to the site so they I used to
do<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:43.190> which<00:02:44.190> worked<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.610> while

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
do it like this which worked for a while

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
do it like this which worked for a while
but<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> realized<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.230> really<00:02:46.440> catch

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
but then I realized it's a really catch

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.180 
but then I realized it's a really catch
we've<00:02:46.950> done<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.550> stopped<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.950> yeah<00:02:49.950> it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
we've done it so I stopped and yeah it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
we've done it so I stopped and yeah it
was<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.700> seen<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.330> know<00:02:51.420> creme<00:02:51.720> creme

curvy said his name
the<00:02:54.180> Swedish<00:02:54.810> ego<00:02:55.080> who's<00:02:55.470> known<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.680> capped<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the Swedish ego who's known to capped it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.860 
the Swedish ego who's known to capped it
and<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:57.330> see<00:02:57.930> him<00:02:58.110> playing<00:02:58.290> mother<00:02:59.720> he<00:03:00.720> was

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and I see him playing mother he was

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390 
and I see him playing mother he was
going<00:03:01.050> crazy<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.500> us<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:01.800> tried<00:03:02.160> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
going crazy for us so I just tried and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.009 
going crazy for us so I just tried and
it<00:03:02.490> was<00:03:02.580> actually<00:03:02.700> much<00:03:03.000> easier<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.660> it

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
it was actually much easier and it

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.300 
it was actually much easier and it
stopped<00:03:04.260> my<00:03:04.350> hand<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> champion<00:03:04.950> off<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.160> well

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
stopped my hand of champion off as well

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.680 
stopped my hand of champion off as well
which<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> problem<00:03:06.209> or<00:03:06.269> how<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.450> water

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
which is a problem or how the water

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.350 
which is a problem or how the water
table<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.290> blasting<00:03:07.769> too<00:03:07.890> much<00:03:08.900> yeah<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
table it was blasting too much yeah so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.060 
table it was blasting too much yeah so
that's<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> motion<00:03:12.660> really<00:03:12.989> soil<00:03:15.800> as<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.950> can

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that's the motion really soil as you can

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.250 
that's the motion really soil as you can
see<00:03:17.250> my<00:03:17.430> hand<00:03:17.700> basically<00:03:18.239> stays<00:03:18.660> where<00:03:19.140> as

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
see my hand basically stays where as

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.030 
see my hand basically stays where as
it's<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.950> my<00:03:20.070> fingers<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.680> not<00:03:22.830> this

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it's just my fingers and it's not this

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's just my fingers and it's not this
finger<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.090> doesn't<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:24.720> sort<00:03:25.170> of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
finger the doesn't and that's sort of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.020 
finger the doesn't and that's sort of
supporting<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.040> as<00:03:26.160> well<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.820> can't

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
supporting it there as well just can't

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.160 
supporting it there as well just can't
stop<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.360> fall<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.600> your<00:03:27.690> hand<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.050> it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
stop in the fall on your hand but it's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.930 
stop in the fall on your hand but it's
not<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.220> shouldn't<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.640> applying

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
not you shouldn't really be applying

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.729 
not you shouldn't really be applying
much<00:03:30.239> pressure<00:03:30.840> with<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.290> finger<00:03:31.530> either

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
much pressure with that finger either

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.259 
much pressure with that finger either
just<00:03:32.040> necessarily<00:03:32.400> doesn't<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:33.060> deck

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
just necessarily doesn't this deck

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.070 
just necessarily doesn't this deck
doesn't<00:03:33.450> follow<00:03:33.690> your<00:03:33.959> hand<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:35.690> yeah<00:03:36.690> so

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
doesn't follow your hand and yeah so

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.289 
doesn't follow your hand and yeah so
these<00:03:37.830> two<00:03:38.100> fingers<00:03:38.310> are<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.880> ones<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.209> are

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
these two fingers are the ones that are

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.550 
these two fingers are the ones that are
applying<00:03:39.510> most<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> pressure<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:41.269> you're

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
applying most of the pressure and you're

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720 
applying most of the pressure and you're
essentially<00:03:43.560> you're<00:03:43.709> trying<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.010> smack<00:03:44.580> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
essentially you're trying to smack it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.920 
essentially you're trying to smack it
down<00:03:44.760> as<00:03:44.940> fast<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.269> possible<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.810> then<00:03:45.900> just

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
down as fast as possible and then just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.070 
down as fast as possible and then just
take<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> away<00:03:47.130> take<00:03:47.730> your<00:03:47.880> fingers<00:03:48.180> away<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
take it away take your fingers away and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.470 
take it away take your fingers away and
then<00:03:49.380> if<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.890> hits<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.370> head<00:03:50.580> or<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.940> desk<00:03:51.269> in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
then if it hits the head or the desk in

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.170 
then if it hits the head or the desk in
this<00:03:51.600> case

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
this case

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.240 
this case
then<00:03:52.900> all<00:03:53.110> boats<00:03:53.319> bar<00:03:53.530> by<00:03:53.680> itself<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.189> you

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
then all boats bar by itself and you

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.220 
then all boats bar by itself and you
don't<00:03:54.430> really<00:03:54.629> keep<00:03:55.629> your<00:03:55.810> fingers<00:03:56.110> in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
don't really keep your fingers in

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.220 
don't really keep your fingers in
contact<00:03:56.620> with<00:03:56.739> at<00:03:56.920> all<00:03:57.129> times<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:58.329> as<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.110> go

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
contact with at all times and as you go

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.600 
contact with at all times and as you go
really<00:03:59.500> what's<00:03:59.680> head<00:03:59.860> you<00:03:59.980> may<00:04:00.099> well<00:04:00.280> use<00:04:00.430> your

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
really what's head you may well use your

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.009 
really what's head you may well use your
thumbs<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:00.970> should<00:04:01.120> push<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.329> back<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.629> weber

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
thumbs you should push it back a weber

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.179 
thumbs you should push it back a weber
but<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.290> shouldn't<00:04:02.530> really<00:04:02.650> need<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.920> do<00:04:03.010> that

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
but you shouldn't really need to do that

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.940 
but you shouldn't really need to do that
up<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:04.090> your<00:04:04.360> pinkie<00:04:04.750> she's<00:04:05.290> got<00:04:05.409> hangers<00:04:05.799> I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
up and your pinkie she's got hangers I

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.250 
up and your pinkie she's got hangers I
know<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.159> didn't<00:04:06.340> watch<00:04:06.489> at<00:04:06.610> all<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.930> not

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
know you didn't watch at all really not

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.610 
know you didn't watch at all really not
stronger<00:04:08.650> today<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:10.120> yeah<00:04:10.420> that's<00:04:10.959> your<00:04:11.170> your

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
stronger today so yeah that's your your

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:29.879 
stronger today so yeah that's your your
motion<00:04:12.010> really<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:28.169> some<00:04:29.169> reason<00:04:29.440> when<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.740> go

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
motion really for some reason when I go

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.500 
motion really for some reason when I go
really<00:04:30.160> fast<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.610> starts<00:04:30.910> doing<00:04:31.090> more<00:04:31.270> desk

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
really fast it starts doing more desk

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.969 
really fast it starts doing more desk
finger<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.350> one<00:04:32.530> right<00:04:32.650> here

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
finger this one right here

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.490 
finger this one right here
see<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.550> one<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:34.720> actually<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.350> one

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
see that one it's actually more that one

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.230 
see that one it's actually more that one
that<00:04:35.770> does<00:04:35.949> most<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.490> pushing<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:36.970> bless

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
that does most of the pushing and bless

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.189 
that does most of the pushing and bless
your<00:04:37.539> ring<00:04:37.750> finger<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:39.270> don't<00:04:40.270> know<00:04:40.360> why<00:04:40.570> just

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
your ring finger and don't know why just

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.779 
your ring finger and don't know why just
helps<00:04:41.530> for<00:04:41.620> some<00:04:41.770> reason<00:04:42.449> yeah<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:43.660> that's<00:04:47.789> not

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
helps for some reason yeah so that's not

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.909 
helps for some reason yeah so that's not
shelter<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.479> will<00:04:49.900> probably<00:04:50.110> do<00:04:50.470> some<00:04:50.680> kind<00:04:50.889> of

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
shelter I will probably do some kind of

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.920 
shelter I will probably do some kind of
blasting<00:04:51.639> less<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.240> their<00:04:52.360> future<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.870> I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
blasting less and in their future so I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.850 
blasting less and in their future so I
can<00:04:53.080> show<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.229> hooking<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.710> actually

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
can show you hooking you can actually

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.469 
can show you hooking you can actually
apply<00:04:54.039> this<00:04:54.250> technique<00:04:54.669> but<00:04:54.849> until<00:04:55.090> then<00:04:55.300> just

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
apply this technique but until then just

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.810 
apply this technique but until then just
get<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> good<00:04:56.470> try<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.130> not<00:04:57.280> do<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.520> desk

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
get that good try to not do that desk

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.310 
get that good try to not do that desk
I'm<00:04:58.210> just<00:04:58.389> doing<00:04:58.539> like<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.840> because<00:04:59.229> I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
I'm just doing like this because I

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.930
