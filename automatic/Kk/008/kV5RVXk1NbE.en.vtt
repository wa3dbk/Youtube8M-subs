00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.569
 The Haarlem-Amsterdam connection was the first railway line in the Netherlands 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:14.549
 in 18 39 a train drove between these two cities for the first time and for 69 cents 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.669
 had a one-way ticket 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.499
 by the way, he himself sat English on the plates 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.339
 because there were no trained drivers in the Netherlands yet 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.659
 the rail network soon expressed itself and the important connection point asked 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.009
 around a special building 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.649
 in the direction of 8 both richly decorated station put into use 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.350
 at the station was built in the art nouveau style by the architect marcel 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 brands 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.360
 Amersfoort 3 has designed derailed at NATO stations 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.780
 the railways were a Dutch iron era at that time 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.360
 railroad company too much money and I wanted a high tone 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.220
 that is why you see a lot of tile panels, with work and stained glass 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.320
 the woman is, of course, behind a story 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.140
 like it's always done 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.259
 the team symbolizes the city gate 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.020
 with a deviated shot had weapons from the three cities of Holland 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 he fears for society, I am proud of that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 Amersfoort and Alkmaar 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.420
 the special thing about justice is that the station buildings are all on the new 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.430
 program 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.280
 the contours of the station manager 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.500
 in charge 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.590
 the toilets 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.800
 the administration the big his house and the many different guards are there 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.450
 as long as the waiting rooms were heard it was again to travel with the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.110
 train 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.430
 stood there 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.510
 a stand of the coming it was not really nice to wait for the platform 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.270
 on the train 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
 so too much waiting room for every layer of the population and this was the 1st waiting room 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 class and that of course was the most luxuriously decorated 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.130
 there are also phone calls in this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.159
 the design probably has two american ones by mistake 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.080
 example taken with a farmyard to wipe the cattle off the rails 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.949
 driver encountered during his ride 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.949
 and of course we didn't have that just like the train 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.629
 too early for the second class waiting rooms 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 that say separate bathroom for ladies 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.329
 and where you now drink your coffee as in the past the waiting room third class 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.579
 for the list with the cheapest tickets 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.579
 no expense has been spared in this waiting room 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.120
 MDP is a very special waiting room especially for those at that time called 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.499
 insane 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.669
 because there is quite a bit of psychiatric institution in the surroundings of haarlem 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.170
 goods 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.729
 like Stanford bird song and he walks 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.670
 the patients out there with tourists 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.619
 that kept apart from all other travelers 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.179
 they also get this stick in their pants 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.199
 to prevent them from running away m 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.759
 I can tell you to watch out for lag 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.480
 9 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.439
 7 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.269
 Papandreou used to come to mind for a long time and hardly any of the station 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.289
 has been preserved 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.289
 Is it true that they are also called Duisburg? 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:27.999
 because say yourself 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 it seems like a virtue from the Middle Ages 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.029
 arose to the train traffic controller from here all tracks and platforms are alright 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:43.779
 survey 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 but just got away with it 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.859
 and in a signal box football match his switch box 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.419
 the machine is sometimes like this 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.669
 and the wifi if he could leave 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.669
 to stop 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.869
 haarlem central station is a national monument 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.409
 and it is perhaps what only she is so bad in the Netherlands 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.579
 mister train is missing 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.579
 it's enough to see dogg 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 good 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.659
 we see
