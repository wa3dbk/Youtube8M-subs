00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
use torrential if you have like a cyber

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.860 
use torrential if you have like a cyber
valley<00:06:46.820> on<00:06:47.000> the<00:06:47.060> field<00:06:47.270> you<00:06:47.390> can<00:06:47.510> just<00:06:47.660> sit<00:06:47.840> on

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
valley on the field you can just sit on

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.600 
valley on the field you can just sit on
it<00:06:48.080> wait<00:06:48.470> for<00:06:48.620> them<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:48.770> attack<00:06:49.100> over<00:06:49.460> next

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
it wait for them to attack over next

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.970 
it wait for them to attack over next
turn<00:06:49.820> use<00:06:50.030> torrential<00:06:50.480> so<00:06:50.630> yeah<00:06:51.230> I<00:06:51.440> think<00:06:51.650> this

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
turn use torrential so yeah I think this

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.100 
turn use torrential so yeah I think this
is<00:06:52.160> a<00:06:52.190> pretty<00:06:52.400> interesting<00:06:52.820> deck<00:06:53.420> again<00:06:53.960> it's

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
is a pretty interesting deck again it's

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.790 
is a pretty interesting deck again it's
kind<00:06:54.380> of<00:06:54.530> like<00:06:54.680> if<00:06:55.090> chaos<00:06:56.090> and<00:06:56.590> monarchs<00:06:57.590> like

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
kind of like if chaos and monarchs like

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.530 
kind of like if chaos and monarchs like
had<00:06:58.010> a<00:06:58.040> baby<00:06:58.400> this<00:06:58.580> would<00:06:58.760> be<00:06:58.910> it<00:06:59.060> one<00:06:59.300> card

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
had a baby this would be it one card

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.970 
had a baby this would be it one card
that<00:06:59.600> I<00:06:59.690> did<00:06:59.990> actually<00:07:00.140> consider<00:07:00.710> in<00:07:00.860> this

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
that I did actually consider in this

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.830 
that I did actually consider in this
deck<00:07:01.250> what<00:07:01.790> stream<00:07:02.060> or<00:07:02.180> fraud<00:07:02.450> but<00:07:02.660> then<00:07:02.810> I

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
deck what stream or fraud but then I

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.360 
deck what stream or fraud but then I
realized<00:07:03.260> like<00:07:03.410> you<00:07:03.650> don't<00:07:03.830> have<00:07:03.950> enough

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
realized like you don't have enough

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.560 
realized like you don't have enough
mailing<00:07:04.880> power<00:07:05.090> you<00:07:05.270> don't<00:07:05.390> have<00:07:05.480> enough

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.570 
mailing power you don't have enough

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.630 
mailing power you don't have enough
dumping<00:07:06.020> power<00:07:06.200> or<00:07:06.530> anything<00:07:07.250> like<00:07:07.280> that<00:07:07.430> to

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
dumping power or anything like that to

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.970 
dumping power or anything like that to
really<00:07:08.510> get<00:07:08.780> the<00:07:08.930> effectiveness<00:07:09.440> out<00:07:09.710> of<00:07:09.860> it

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
really get the effectiveness out of it

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.140 
really get the effectiveness out of it
you<00:07:10.190> mean<00:07:10.370> you'd<00:07:10.550> have<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:10.820> run<00:07:10.940> something

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
you mean you'd have to run something

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.030 
you mean you'd have to run something
like<00:07:11.270> foolish<00:07:11.720> which<00:07:12.290> would<00:07:12.470> only<00:07:12.650> work<00:07:12.950> with

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
like foolish which would only work with

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.770 
like foolish which would only work with
that<00:07:13.220> card<00:07:13.490> and<00:07:13.730> it<00:07:13.820> would<00:07:13.940> add<00:07:14.060> two<00:07:14.240> cards<00:07:14.600> to

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
that card and it would add two cards to

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.620 
that card and it would add two cards to
the<00:07:14.900> deck<00:07:15.110> so<00:07:15.350> yeah<00:07:16.130> if<00:07:17.030> you<00:07:17.150> guys<00:07:17.270> have<00:07:17.510> any

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
the deck so yeah if you guys have any

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.600 
the deck so yeah if you guys have any
suggestions<00:07:18.140> or<00:07:18.470> you<00:07:18.590> guys<00:07:18.740> have<00:07:19.430> any

suggestions or you guys have any
questions<00:07:19.760> on<00:07:20.180> this<00:07:20.210> deck<00:07:20.510> just<00:07:20.780> let<00:07:21.260> me<00:07:21.380> know

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
questions on this deck just let me know

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.470 
questions on this deck just let me know
the<00:07:21.980> extra<00:07:22.280> deck<00:07:22.430> I<00:07:22.550> don't<00:07:22.730> have<00:07:22.910> shown<00:07:23.210> but<00:07:23.420> I

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 
the extra deck I don't have shown but I

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.690 
the extra deck I don't have shown but I
mean<00:07:23.660> it's<00:07:23.810> pretty<00:07:24.320> basic<00:07:24.710> I<00:07:25.100> mean<00:07:25.280> you're

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
mean it's pretty basic I mean you're

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.130 
mean it's pretty basic I mean you're
going<00:07:25.790> to<00:07:25.880> be<00:07:25.940> running<00:07:26.120> you<00:07:26.330> know<00:07:26.450> like<00:07:26.720> a<00:07:26.870> few

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140 
going to be running you know like a few

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.790 
going to be running you know like a few
synchros<00:07:27.590> like<00:07:27.860> level<00:07:28.250> 5<00:07:28.600> level<00:07:29.600> 9<00:07:30.020> because<00:07:30.650> of

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
synchros like level 5 level 9 because of

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.220 
synchros like level 5 level 9 because of
the<00:07:30.890> effect<00:07:31.610> veiler<00:07:31.730> please<00:07:32.120> I<00:07:32.570> would

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 
the effect veiler please I would

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.960 
the effect veiler please I would
probably<00:07:33.680> run<00:07:33.830> like<00:07:34.010> a<00:07:34.040> formula<00:07:34.460> Synchron<00:07:34.820> in

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
probably run like a formula Synchron in

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.850 
probably run like a formula Synchron in
case<00:07:35.150> you<00:07:35.720> have<00:07:35.870> some<00:07:36.110> situation<00:07:36.680> where

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
case you have some situation where

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.810 
case you have some situation where
you're<00:07:36.920> going<00:07:37.070> to<00:07:37.130> want<00:07:37.220> to<00:07:37.280> use<00:07:37.400> formula

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
you're going to want to use formula

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.790 
you're going to want to use formula
Synchron<00:07:38.210> instead<00:07:38.780> of<00:07:38.870> using<00:07:39.050> cyber<00:07:39.440> Ali's

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
Synchron instead of using cyber Ali's

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.620 
Synchron instead of using cyber Ali's
effect<00:07:40.160> for<00:07:40.550> whatever<00:07:40.850> reason<00:07:41.270> and<00:07:41.390> then<00:07:41.540> the

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630 
effect for whatever reason and then the

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.420 
effect for whatever reason and then the
rest<00:07:41.780> will<00:07:41.960> probably<00:07:42.230> just<00:07:42.350> be<00:07:42.440> like<00:07:42.650> rent

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
rest will probably just be like rent

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.360 
rest will probably just be like rent
threes<00:07:43.760> and<00:07:44.210> rank<00:07:44.990> fours<00:07:45.260> maybe<00:07:45.740> like<00:07:45.980> one<00:07:46.250> or

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370 
threes and rank fours maybe like one or

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.250 
threes and rank fours maybe like one or
so<00:07:46.550> rank<00:07:46.850> for<00:07:47.090> I<00:07:47.300> guess<00:07:47.750> that's<00:07:47.900> pretty<00:07:48.080> much

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.260 
so rank for I guess that's pretty much

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.480 
so rank for I guess that's pretty much
it<00:07:48.320> guys<00:07:48.470> let<00:07:48.860> me<00:07:48.890> know<00:07:49.040> what<00:07:49.100> you<00:07:49.220> think<00:07:49.370> of

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490 
it guys let me know what you think of

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.340 
it guys let me know what you think of
the<00:07:49.580> deck<00:07:49.790> and<00:07:50.060> thank<00:07:50.750> you<00:07:50.870> for<00:07:51.020> watching<00:07:51.050> as

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.350
