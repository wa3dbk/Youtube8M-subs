I'm<00:00:01.220> quite<00:00:01.760> impressed<00:00:01.940> with<00:00:02.420> the<00:00:02.600> Malmstrom

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:02.900 
I'm quite impressed with the Malmstrom

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.960 
I'm quite impressed with the Malmstrom
case<00:00:03.380> not<00:00:03.860> only<00:00:03.890> because<00:00:04.370> of<00:00:04.400> the<00:00:04.520> people

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
case not only because of the people

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.299 
case not only because of the people
involved<00:00:05.629> and<00:00:06.140> there<00:00:06.890> were<00:00:06.950> quite<00:00:07.160> a<00:00:07.220> few

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.580 
people involved it wasn't just a flyover
by<00:00:09.920> applying<00:00:10.310> so<00:00:10.610> I<00:00:10.640> throw<00:00:10.910> what<00:00:11.180> went<00:00:11.390> by<00:00:11.630> but

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
by applying so I throw what went by but

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.440 
by applying so I throw what went by but
the<00:00:12.770> impact<00:00:13.190> on<00:00:13.430> the<00:00:13.580> equipment<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.270> was

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
the impact on the equipment that was

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.480 
the impact on the equipment that was
there<00:00:14.840> I<00:00:15.020> mean<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:15.650> kind<00:00:15.800> of<00:00:15.830> scary<00:00:16.189> when<00:00:16.369> you

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
there I mean it's kind of scary when you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.950 
there I mean it's kind of scary when you
think<00:00:16.519> of<00:00:17.860> missiles<00:00:19.030> being<00:00:20.030> affected<00:00:20.690> by<00:00:20.930> a

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
think of missiles being affected by a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.100 
think of missiles being affected by a
foreign<00:00:21.710> power<00:00:21.740> if<00:00:22.400> you<00:00:22.430> will<00:00:22.630> I've<00:00:23.630> talked<00:00:23.990> to

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
foreign power if you will I've talked to

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.810 
foreign power if you will I've talked to
captain<00:00:24.289> Salas<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:25.070> was<00:00:25.220> favorably<00:00:25.730> impressed

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
captain Salas I was favorably impressed

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.140 
captain Salas I was favorably impressed
with<00:00:26.300> him<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:28.000> documentation<00:00:29.000> from

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
with him and the documentation from

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.380 
with him and the documentation from
Boeing<00:00:29.600> and<00:00:29.750> it's<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.529> whole<00:00:30.680> big<00:00:30.920> story<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.119> I

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
Boeing and it's a whole big story so I

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.210 
Boeing and it's a whole big story so I
consider<00:00:32.810> it<00:00:32.899> an<00:00:33.079> important<00:00:33.590> case<00:00:33.800> and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
consider it an important case and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.440 
consider it an important case and
remember<00:00:35.000> it's<00:00:35.180> one<00:00:35.420> of<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.660> number<00:00:35.899> of<00:00:36.079> cases

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
remember it's one of a number of cases

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.190 
remember it's one of a number of cases
around<00:00:38.450> sac<00:00:39.020> basis<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:40.570> think<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.750> quality<00:00:41.960> of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
around sac basis I think the quality of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.740 
around sac basis I think the quality of
witnesses<00:00:42.770> is<00:00:43.340> very<00:00:43.700> important<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.480> in<00:00:44.630> this

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
witnesses is very important and in this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.080 
witnesses is very important and in this
case<00:00:44.989> yes<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.770> missile<00:00:46.190> officers<00:00:46.550> are<00:00:46.760> highly

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
case yes the missile officers are highly

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.870 
case yes the missile officers are highly
trained<00:00:47.920> engineering<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.160> science<00:00:49.579> types

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
trained engineering and science types

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.930 
trained engineering and science types
for<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.329> most<00:00:50.480> part<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:52.430> air<00:00:52.579> police

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
for the most part and the air police

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.240 
for the most part and the air police
these<00:00:53.600> people<00:00:53.989> go<00:00:54.230> through<00:00:54.469> special<00:00:54.890> security

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
these people go through special security

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.150 
these people go through special security
schools<00:00:55.790> they<00:00:56.180> have<00:00:56.360> secret<00:00:57.320> clearances<00:00:57.860> that

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
schools they have secret clearances that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.700 
schools they have secret clearances that
sort<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.180> thing<00:00:59.239> they<00:00:59.629> carry<00:00:59.899> weapons<00:01:00.379> they're

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
sort of thing they carry weapons they're

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.979 
sort of thing they carry weapons they're
you<00:01:01.280> know<00:01:01.340> they're<00:01:01.460> highly<00:01:02.450> trained<00:01:02.750> people

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
you know they're highly trained people

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.689 
you know they're highly trained people
so<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:03.410> think<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:03.800> very<00:01:03.860> significant<00:01:04.579> with

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
so I think it's very significant with

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.420 
so I think it's very significant with
people<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.089> this<00:01:05.210> caliber<00:01:05.890> make<00:01:06.890> sightings

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
people of this caliber make sightings

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.160 
people of this caliber make sightings
the<00:01:07.640> tragedy<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:08.690> don't<00:01:08.840> know<00:01:09.020> all

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
the tragedy is that we don't know all

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.660 
the tragedy is that we don't know all
the<00:01:09.200> details<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:09.979> reports<00:01:10.430> they<00:01:10.580> have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the details of the reports they have

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.840 
the details of the reports they have
been<00:01:10.820> kept<00:01:11.030> secret<00:01:11.799> I'm<00:01:12.799> convinced<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.700> we

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
been kept secret I'm convinced that we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.620 
been kept secret I'm convinced that we
were<00:01:13.970> visited<00:01:14.150> by<00:01:14.450> some<00:01:15.229> extraterrestrial

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
were visited by some extraterrestrial

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.649 
were visited by some extraterrestrial
object<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.320> there<00:01:19.220> was<00:01:19.510> not<00:01:20.510> only

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
object and that there was not only

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.870 
object and that there was not only
visited<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.470> there<00:01:21.710> was<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.890> definite<00:01:22.520> message

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
visited but there was a definite message

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.060 
visited but there was a definite message
and<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:25.549> message<00:01:25.939> was<00:01:26.710> get<00:01:27.710> rid<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:27.920> your

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
and and the message was get rid of your

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.520 
and and the message was get rid of your
nuclear<00:01:28.460> weapons<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:32.150> can't<00:01:32.750> avoid<00:01:33.049> that

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
nuclear weapons and I can't avoid that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.100 
nuclear weapons and I can't avoid that
conclusion<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.400> mean<00:01:34.549> I've<00:01:34.670> all<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.479> over<00:01:35.810> my

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
conclusion I mean I've all this over my

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.510 
conclusion I mean I've all this over my
head<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:36.670> basically<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.570> was

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
head but basically the this was

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.050 
head but basically the this was
demonstration<00:01:40.869> what<00:01:41.869> they<00:01:42.020> could<00:01:42.290> do<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.060> but

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
demonstration what they could do and but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.410 
demonstration what they could do and but
not<00:01:44.270> only<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.509> demonstration<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:46.700> message

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
not only a demonstration but a message

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.560 
not only a demonstration but a message
to<00:01:47.720> put<00:01:48.680> these<00:01:48.860> weapons<00:01:49.280> away<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.939> give

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
to put these weapons away you know give

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.230 
to put these weapons away you know give
these<00:01:50.690> weapons<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:52.940> has<00:01:53.090> been

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
these weapons and this has been

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.800 
these weapons and this has been
reinforced<00:01:53.900> by<00:01:54.080> by<00:01:55.720> investigating<00:01:56.720> or

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
reinforced by by investigating or

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.380 
reinforced by by investigating or
looking<00:01:57.110> into<00:01:57.500> other<00:01:58.340> incidents<00:01:59.000> very

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
looking into other incidents very

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.810 
looking into other incidents very
similar<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.870> this<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:00.290> where<00:02:00.550> UFOs<00:02:01.550> were

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
similar to this one where UFOs were

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.350 
similar to this one where UFOs were
sighted<00:02:02.030> over<00:02:02.270> nuclear<00:02:03.020> sites<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.360> weapons

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
sighted over nuclear sites and weapons

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.260 
sighted over nuclear sites and weapons
storage<00:02:05.630> facilities
