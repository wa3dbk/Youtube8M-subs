00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.650
 what happens gamers welcome back 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.960
 here to more people gaming I am older 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.749
 and this is a new top of the most games 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.159
 expected from warhammer 40,000 seems to be 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.039
 that games workshop has liberalized 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.359
 quite your franchise and now many 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.689
 Studies are launched to make new 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.780
 video games we hope they are good 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.800
 starting with which 5 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.290
 it's better to be an adventure within 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.150
 the low funds of wallace to see 40,000 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.790
 where it seems good that we have 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.040
 to a kind of inquisitor and we're going 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.650
 pretty good aesthetics 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.110
 dark very ornate Victorian scroll and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.300
 such really is the normal aesthetics and 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.739
 warhammer current 40,000 more and 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.720
 above we are supposedly the low ones 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.980
 funds will be super dark all but 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.780
 that could remind us a bit of 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.220
 blackburn however good we could not 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.320
 maybe wait so much for this game 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.930
 not because it's going to be for mobile it's worth 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.820
 iphone mobile although it's also going to be 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.410
 for windows as it puts and good 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.210
 Sincerely has some good graphics 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.880
 for the platform for which it is 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.800
 designed 4 space wing of edwin hulk 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 means to that of death and the wing of 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.970
 death is an elite team of 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.070
 exterminators inside the angels 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.670
 dark and the dark angels are a 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.780
 chapter of space marines so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.729
 recognized and renowned within the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.350
 universe of warhammer 40,000 that are 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.530
 basically its strong and what really 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.120
 promote within this universe of 40 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.890
 Okay judges 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.330
 supposedly from this game of which 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.610
 we really have not come to see 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.070
 gameplay still but of which already 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.900
 we have some video that at the same 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.300
 supposedly time I think it's done 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.090
 with in game graphics and that's why maybe not 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.620
 we have moved up from position 4 because I do not know 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
 for now, how are you going to play but 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.240
 It looks very good and the reason why 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 which could expect this game is because 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.500
 the original space hulk is a game of 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.000
 makes the repera very good but obviously 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 he has spent the years that was 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.640
 first person 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.710
 basically it was about marines 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.290
 Spacers of Marine Terminators 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.300
 Spaces facing the known 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.690
 like the tyrants the xenomorphs the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 lighter aliens let's say 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.730
 visually and the question is that this 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 game be in a game space july had 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.020
 an heir a new space hulk does 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.180
 relatively little but that was a game 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.060
 by turns it was not as such a game of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.980
 shooter action to the usual mode then 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.010
 I think you would be asked and a little 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.920
 soul to what the game is in plan to mode 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.080
 of sequel and I think this cool stage 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.850
 edwin could recover that same 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.490
 but what more games could we expect? 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.590
 now in brief that deserved a lot 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.769
 the penalty 3 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.330
 give links to flour yes sir you have 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.209
 seen a little from game on the channel 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.830
 because I warned you that it will come out and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.750
 also because I have access 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.489
 anticipated really follow this game already 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.230
 has this is anticipated and can be 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.879
 get to play but are the ends of 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.610
 week and if you're inside the alpha 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.500
 so good I wanted to put it inside 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.060
 let 's say it 's ready because it's not a 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 early access such as the one in 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.200
 steam we could have the warhammer 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.760
 40,000 king inside and that then I already 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.610
 I think it has come out but this one 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.590
 is still he has to be polished and 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.349
 all the roll but it looks very good 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.620
 which is basically an online multiplayer 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.200
 flour or be a warhammer mode 40,000 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.840
 fashion and warhammer 40,000 this has to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.340
 for eggs to be a valid success the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.590
 I really hoped that in some 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.269
 moment of history gamer go out to a 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.250
 fashion or warhammer fantasy or 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.829
 40,000 warhammer has all the potential 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.860
 of the world because the characters are already 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.730
 there a very rich and good story because 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.519
 options 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.950
 ameal of customization at least or 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.200
 but pure and hard customization without 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.240
 many chapters or armies from where 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.610
 choose skins 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.550
 and well, evidently in the end it has 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.130
 come out a very juicy game with a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.710
 tremendously tremendous gameplay with their 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.410
 strong and independent points against 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.010
 other fashions then by bitsa pop it 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 remains with the position number 32 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.470
 I have put the number two for who 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.350
 who stays forever the cruzeiro the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.479
 The crossing will basically be the 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.750
 putt the front the star wars battlefront 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.970
 of warhammer 40000 strongly 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.610
 obviously influenced by battlefield 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.520
 and especially because of planetside because all 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.440
 the action will take place within what 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.419
 that is going to be a planet where diverse 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.789
 factions are going to dispute the ground 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.650
 then he's going to have a little roll of 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.410
 rolle o but above all many battles 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.020
 super fierce full of action goes to 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.210
 be the number one action game I 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.699
 I would say warhammer 40,000 even though 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.680
 the stress marÃ­n was very good game for 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.630
 is much more focused on the online and 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.330
 make a really mass game 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.770
 then orc space marines 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.360
 tyranids the dash 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:05.080
 is going to be a real step t1 and we arrived 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.120
 to number 1 that is the most boludo the most 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.810
 podium what we could get to imagine 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.810
 of warhammer 40000 gothic battlefield 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.380
 my god, the terrible straw for the 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.570
 warhammer fanboys 40,000 is a 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.120
 authentic step at the moment we only have 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.450
 little more than a trailer that teaches us 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.100
 let's say vehicles in game in ships that 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.230
 They are practically like cathedrals 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.150
 gigantic full of flying cannons 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.030
 through space we see the imperial fleet 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.060
 we see supposedly far away a fleet 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:05.190
 of the space marines of mother chaos 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.140
 my love is beautiful is overwhelming 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.720
 it's mostly because of the fact that it returns 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.700
 gothic battlefield our hands that is 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.070
 let's say a sister license of 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.230
 warhammer 40,000 that is part 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.240
 obviously of the licenses of games 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.820
 workshop and that we did not see since the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.370
 repera because the game fell basically 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.010
 in disuse and stopped selling and from this 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.630
 10 years ago at least then 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.760
 we are talking about a board game 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.150
 that had great potential now 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.550
 happens to be computer game video game 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.590
 then it 's damn great I do not know 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.529
 how it will be played I do not know if it will be like the eve 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.749
 online or star wars in fire at war 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.999
 have we go everything necessary to be 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:48.659
 terribly epic a ship design 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:51.989
 totally private and independent and 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.759
 full of visual charisma as he could not 

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:56.879
 to be otherwise is warhammer 40,000 is 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.469
 Gothic battlefield then this game 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.359
 It has to be the damned rapper because 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:03.089
 On the one hand, let us experience the 

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:05.129
 Space battles of the 40- k universe 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:08.669
 and on the other hand, simply for 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.859
 relive all those anxieties and that spirit 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.659
 of battlefield kotick that he was doing so much 

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:14.909
 At least I think that among the 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:16.829
 40,000 warhammer fans so nothing 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.869
 this has been the top of most games 

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:20.909
 expected of 40 that now in the 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:23.099
 comments say if you agree or 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.719
 make your own top all said 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:28.519
 they put it in a good like and we'll see 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:28.519
 in the next one arrives 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.550
 He said 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:42.029
 of pure pure red
