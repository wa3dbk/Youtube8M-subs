kind of test this out and really excited
to<00:00:42.079> use<00:00:42.110> it<00:00:42.530> we<00:00:43.070> just<00:00:43.310> had<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.489> new<00:00:44.300> baby<00:00:44.329> as<00:00:44.900> well

to use it we just had a new baby as well

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.040 
to use it we just had a new baby as well
so<00:00:45.440> we'll<00:00:46.280> definitely<00:00:46.750> put<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.020> test

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
so we'll definitely put it to the test

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.880 
so we'll definitely put it to the test
as<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.100> can<00:00:49.310> see<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:49.610> pretty<00:00:49.820> small<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.890> size

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
as you can see it's pretty small in size

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.549 
as you can see it's pretty small in size
which<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.399> great<00:00:52.730> for<00:00:53.540> us<00:00:53.630> here<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:53.899> Chicago<00:00:54.350> to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
which is great for us here in Chicago to

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.170 
which is great for us here in Chicago to
save<00:00:54.770> some<00:00:54.950> counter<00:00:55.250> space<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.760> small

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
save some counter space and small

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.260 
save some counter space and small
apartments<00:00:57.250> but<00:00:58.250> we're<00:00:58.399> gonna<00:00:58.880> try<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.120> out

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
apartments but we're gonna try it out

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.569 
apartments but we're gonna try it out
and<00:00:59.540> so<00:00:59.750> it's<00:01:00.020> really<00:01:00.170> simple<00:01:00.469> once<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.430> get

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
and so it's really simple once you get

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.220 
and so it's really simple once you get
into<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.880> kitchen<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.450> can<00:01:02.480> just<00:01:02.719> grab<00:01:02.989> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
gonna do that right now

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.690 
gonna do that right now
and<00:01:08.979> there's<00:01:09.979> some<00:01:10.100> simple<00:01:10.400> instructions

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
and there's some simple instructions

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.270 
and there's some simple instructions
we'll<00:01:11.060> actually<00:01:11.750> go<00:01:12.020> through<00:01:12.200> this

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
we'll actually go through this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920 
we'll actually go through this
you<00:01:13.790> can<00:01:13.940> plug<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.950> warmer<00:01:16.400> into<00:01:16.930> the

and about a cup and 3/4 cups of water to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.969 
and about a cup and 3/4 cups of water to
a<00:01:26.210> fill<00:01:26.540> line<00:01:26.750> I'll<00:01:26.930> tell<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.260> exactly<00:01:27.380> when

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
a fill line I'll tell you exactly when

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.060 
a fill line I'll tell you exactly when
it's<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.060> perfect<00:01:29.299> amount<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.229> water<00:01:30.409> so

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it's the perfect amount of water so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.120 
it's the perfect amount of water so
we're<00:01:31.280> gonna<00:01:31.400> go<00:01:31.520> ahead<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.760> do<00:01:31.820> that

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.100 

let<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.240> kind<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.689> sit<00:01:37.420> well<00:01:38.420> while<00:01:38.990> we're

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
let that kind of sit well while we're

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.660 
let that kind of sit well while we're
waiting<00:01:39.140> there's<00:01:39.560> actually<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.100> catch<00:01:40.430> on<00:01:40.580> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
waiting there's actually a catch on the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.249 
waiting there's actually a catch on the
top<00:01:40.909> of<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:44.030> product<00:01:44.450> where<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.869> think

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
top of the the product where you think

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
top of the the product where you think
that<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> water<00:01:45.799> is<00:01:46.009> actually<00:01:46.310> going<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.490> flow

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
that the water is actually going to flow

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.070 
that the water is actually going to flow
over<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.149> actually<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.479> catch<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:47.930> like<00:01:48.049> a

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
over it's actually to catch in like a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.620 
over it's actually to catch in like a
drain<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.640> go<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.030> down<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.240> what<00:01:50.509> it's
