realistic<00:00:17.609> skeleton<00:00:18.390> break<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.740> there<00:00:19.859> will

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
realistic skeleton break and there will

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.929 
realistic skeleton break and there will

and do like that and wrote it this way
this<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.079> I'll<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.350> move<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
this way and I'll just move it like this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
this way and I'll just move it like this
and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> leg<00:01:38.460> movements<00:01:38.909> these

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and then we have the leg movements these

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
and then we have the leg movements these
are<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> goals<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
are the goals down here make you just

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.330 
are the goals down here make you just
move<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.530> as<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:43.950> move<00:01:44.159> like

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
move like this as you see they move like

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
move like this as you see they move like
this<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:45.869> kneepads

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this so they have a kind of an kneepads

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.700 
this so they have a kind of an kneepads
I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.759> :<00:01:48.030> English<00:01:48.270> doesn't<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.439> they

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I think that : English doesn't see they

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
I think that : English doesn't see they
have<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.040> kind<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> kneepads<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
have these kind of kneepads and I really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
have these kind of kneepads and I really
like<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.590> rig<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.100> supposed<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
like this rig it was supposed to be a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
like this rig it was supposed to be a
human<00:01:54.360> skill<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> break<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.159> there

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
human skill to break and and there

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.069 
human skill to break and and there
should<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> guts<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
should be all the kind of guts and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.620 
should be all the kind of guts and
hearts<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.600> just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
hearts and all this in here and but just

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
hearts and all this in here and but just
is<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.259> decided<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> skill

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
is that it decided to make it to a skill

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.620 
is that it decided to make it to a skill
to<00:02:02.549> break<00:02:03.439> since<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.619> could<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.280> pretty<00:02:06.030> cool

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to break since it could look pretty cool

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.440 
to break since it could look pretty cool

and yeah that still eggs I should see

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.449 
and yeah that still eggs I should see
the<00:02:09.479> look<00:02:09.720> pretty<00:02:10.110> cool

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the look pretty cool

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.059 
the look pretty cool
now<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.520> arms<00:02:11.880> also<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.069> we

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
now the arms also that like that and we

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.820 
now the arms also that like that and we
had<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.970> wave<00:02:15.480> Leonard<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.470> there's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
had to make a wave Leonard and I there's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.940 
had to make a wave Leonard and I there's
also<00:02:17.190> thinking<00:02:17.550> drifting<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.209> him<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:19.020> there's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
also thinking drifting to him it there's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.070 
also thinking drifting to him it there's
a<00:02:20.069> link<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.370> description<00:02:20.880> below<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.540> his

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
a link in description below to his

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.890 
a link in description below to his
channel<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.580> has<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.730> talk<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> slow<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> know

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
channel and has to talk at a slow I know

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.820 
channel and has to talk at a slow I know
and<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.239> forget<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.780> thing<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.230> where<00:02:28.500> it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and so we forget this thing out where it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.280 
and so we forget this thing out where it
connects<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> body<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.030> still<00:02:30.480> at<00:02:30.900> them

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
connects to the body and still at them

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.870 
connects to the body and still at them
should<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> right<00:02:32.069> place<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
should be on the right place in the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.600 
should be on the right place in the
middle<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.390> arm<00:02:33.980> session<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.280> bridge

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
middle of the arm session see it bridge

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.020 
middle of the arm session see it bridge
moves<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.610> looks<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.940> little

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
moves like this and it looks a little

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.030 
moves like this and it looks a little
bit<00:02:39.239> weird<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.870> actually<00:02:40.260> it's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
bit weird but it's actually it's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.420 
bit weird but it's actually it's
actually<00:02:41.340> pretty<00:02:41.459> good<00:02:41.640> um<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.130> shouldn't

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
actually pretty good um so I shouldn't

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.850 
actually pretty good um so I shouldn't
Zika<00:02:44.900> look<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.019> makes<00:02:46.200> pretty<00:02:46.350> good<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.680> should

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
Zika look it makes pretty good I should

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.380 
Zika look it makes pretty good I should
say<00:02:46.980> so

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
say so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.080 
say so
if<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.750> should<00:02:48.959> say<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.170> myself<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.640> just

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
if I should say so myself this is just

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.640 
if I should say so myself this is just
the<00:02:51.180> elbow<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.080> bend<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.440> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the elbow so when you bend it like that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.370 
the elbow so when you bend it like that
it<00:02:52.830> should<00:02:52.980> also<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.780> square-ish<00:02:54.780> it's

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it should also be like square-ish it's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.229 
it should also be like square-ish it's
not<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.769> real<00:02:56.069> square<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> looks<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.150> little

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
not a real square but it looks a little

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.180 
not a real square but it looks a little
bit<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:58.290> some<00:02:58.500> parts<00:02:58.890> sticks

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
bit like that and then some parts sticks

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.289 
bit like that and then some parts sticks
out<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.030> actually<00:03:00.510> pretty<00:03:00.780> perfect

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
out so this is actually pretty perfect

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.330 
out so this is actually pretty perfect
see<00:03:03.299> as<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.840> looks<00:03:03.870> pretty<00:03:04.140> good<00:03:04.410> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
see as you see it looks pretty good and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.009 
see as you see it looks pretty good and
now<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.819> other<00:03:06.090> side<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.480> also<00:03:06.540> pretty<00:03:06.840> cool

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
now the other side is also pretty cool

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.520 
now the other side is also pretty cool
cuz<00:03:08.390> when<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.540> click<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.380> see

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
cuz when you click on it as you see

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.289 
cuz when you click on it as you see
deeper<00:03:10.860> also<00:03:11.250> moves<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:12.060> moves

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
deeper also moves like that it moves

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.340 
deeper also moves like that it moves
there<00:03:12.510> as<00:03:12.690> well<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.079> it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
there as well with it

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.680

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
even though he has a string in his arm

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.560 
even though he has a string in his arm
but<00:03:16.380> yeah<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.799> this<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.670> also<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.209> people

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
steps for it so he can go from this step

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.580 
steps for it so he can go from this step
to<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:31.290> by<00:03:31.380> clicking

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and just by moving this little square

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.099 
and just by moving this little square
here<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:36.180> yeah<00:03:36.239> that's<00:03:36.420> pretty<00:03:36.450> cool<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.870> really

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
extra feature to it even though there's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680 
extra feature to it even though there's
a<00:03:43.739> few<00:03:44.160> more<00:03:44.370> I'm<00:03:44.609> just<00:03:44.850> get<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.120> back<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
a few more I'm just get this back to the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.410 
a few more I'm just get this back to the
right<00:03:45.900> position<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:47.820> has<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.150> head

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
right position and it has this head

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.590 
right position and it has this head
moving<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> rotation<00:03:50.150> see<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.299> loads<00:03:51.450> like

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
moving the rotation see the loads like

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.849 
moving the rotation see the loads like
that<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:53.640> has<00:03:53.790> these<00:03:53.970> in-depth<00:03:54.630> eyes<00:03:54.959> so

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
that and it has these in-depth eyes so

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.380 
that and it has these in-depth eyes so
from<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.400> distance<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.880> looks<00:03:57.090> actually<00:03:57.209> pretty

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
from a distance it looks actually pretty

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.680 
from a distance it looks actually pretty
cool<00:03:57.690> instead<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.829> circular<00:03:59.250> eyes<00:03:59.690> also
