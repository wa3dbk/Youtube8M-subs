 Hamelin Kar 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.340

 Virtual PC has not started yes 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.560
 then you should always counter pressure 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130
 that still did not do enough 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.700
 So I meant with not quite dominating 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.520

 you could also have a look at what clothes 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 and then we start fine Sanaa 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 the Gros Connections our sound 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.140
 it was now here on two points 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 then in peace Steyr 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 then on green 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.810
 Jena

 Business partner 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.409

 Hong Kong so and now the TuS NBA 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.019
 to the directory Christ 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.299
 the place is not quite so is supposed to be a bit cold 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.499
 Gallen 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.079
 to hand over all good and God in the form of QSC 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.509
 so right click «view of construction works 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.779
 Unterzeil her until right-clicking skid always 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.349
 Jett then the clothes 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.339
 then these quotes can always be text 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.339
 Henning Kreke wanted as a year 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:39.869
 Investor is off 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.229
 what itches me 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.389
 he is no different because in Lastrup Tiger way 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.129
 then make sure that the participants are right after 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.289
 are initially expected 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.149
 It was said to have changed as you wanted 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.859
 this sounds more like the cross 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.229
 then save counter 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.129
 so now he's been changed with that hall he's hoping that it really will 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.979
 want to upload 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.839
 here is SOK

 Now we are welcome here again 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.779
 in the land of Israel 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.639
 You can change that as well 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.519
 in order to accommodate the text also other cities instead of real 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.249
 Strache wanted more and more 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.829
 if you want to 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.829
 he moved to Guinness 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.939
 TUI has 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.439
 that contradicts and then comes back to her 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 so we skipped 1 8 million 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.639
 risky it is finished 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.569
 Theissen "The field is very loud 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.569
 and now 0 2 lose otherwise too 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.529

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.189
 he gives as always good 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.249
 Password predicts from 90 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.759

 So that pulled yes writes in Jülich stored 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.409
 CCL then spacebar 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.400
 it's not that easy 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.430
 expected / Bremen / Jena 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.389

 Sunny Central 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.319
 because now comes in the next line deep bigger ago 90 part then it has 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.539
 If done correctly, it just means there will be an error 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.249
 as well as at 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:59.849
 they have it in the second

 Southern around point ch murder 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.960
 then learn to rave

 the top scoring 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 too removed 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.610
 but again no mistake has now done right again 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.349

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.199
 I'm sure this was not war again, it had become quiet 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.330
 summarize and solutions at the time 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 There are probably still dead 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.690
 so if the saw was also driven, we meant a lot 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.689
