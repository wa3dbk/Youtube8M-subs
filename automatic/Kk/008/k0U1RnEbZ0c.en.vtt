00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 ah 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.799
 point 5 bags but not the ticket 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.680
 going down a volt comes back to send 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.810
 another signal with more wait than 5 volts 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.960
 and then the scale is bigger 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.759
 because it reaches a volt and returns another 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.970
 once to 3.6 words if in a bowl it returns to 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 return if when the rope arrived it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 comes the scale change and then when 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.980
 we have approximately 100 degrees 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.360
 centigrade 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.720
 if the normal temperature is going to be 2.3 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 morse remember, I repeat at 20 degrees 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.269
 centigrade 3.2 to 3.6 moore starts 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.309
 the temperature to rise and fall which 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.170
 want the voltage when a volt arrives 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.940
 returns again to 3.64 awards and starts 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.000
 to come down again and when it's going to turn on 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.559
 the fan motor that is 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.550
 approximately 100 degrees centigrade 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.840
 to 2.3 boards and that's when you turn on the engine 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.039
 fan 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 What failures do they cause us when this 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:20.460
 sensor is wrong if warm-ups because 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.210
 If it is damaged do not start the engine 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 fan what else our mouth 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.799
 lost power because the loss of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.950
 power if you mark us all the time 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.899
 it's cold it's going to send a lot of gas 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.719
 like a car carburetor by the pse that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.270
 before it accelerated and there was the throat 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.310
 superior the kite enclosed and now 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 no the injection course is higher 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.039
 when it is cold and the regulating valve 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.890
 of mini gear with engine when dreaming like 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.709
 I want to name it opens more so that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.219
 the more air and up the revolutions 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:59.310
 not also that they cause black smoke by 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.379
 the exhaust pipe at least are well 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 obviously what missions pollute and 

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:07.379
 you come out and it's more in some cars like 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.259
 this is disconnected and the carbon frame 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.420
 because because the computer detects that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.420
 is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.270
 at 20 40 degrees centigrade below zero the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.670
 course of direction is so high that it 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.510
 drown the kart the only way to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.709
 igniting them is accelerating thoroughly but the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.709
 car is going to be turning off
