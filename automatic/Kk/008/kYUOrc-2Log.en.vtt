00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
place your trample steam X this wall and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
place your trample steam X this wall and
add<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> angle<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> want<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> angle<00:00:21.390> it

trample steam will come through this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.179 
trample steam will come through this
window<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.920> simply

window and all you want to do is simply

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.089 
window and all you want to do is simply
run<00:00:26.400> towards<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:27.449> tables<00:00:27.840> into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> corner

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
run towards these tables into the corner

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.470 
run towards these tables into the corner
like<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.789> tables<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.300> wall

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
like where they the tables in the wall

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
like where they the tables in the wall
meet<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.740> trample<00:00:32.160> steam<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
meet and if the trample steam is in the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
meet and if the trample steam is in the
correct<00:00:32.669> spot<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.630> you'll<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.079> flung<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
correct spot then you'll be flung in the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
correct spot then you'll be flung in the
table<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.790> move<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> forth

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
table now you can move back and forth

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060 
table now you can move back and forth
and<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.649> out<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
where you actually got into it so you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.030 
where you actually got into it so you
guys<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.170> me<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
guys see me how I just got out of it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
guys see me how I just got out of it
just<00:00:44.129> by<00:00:44.280> running<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> simply<00:00:45.180> um<00:00:45.360> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
just by running out of it simply um so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.119 
just by running out of it simply um so
it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.289> cool<00:00:46.440> glitch<00:00:46.649> beach<00:00:46.800> guys<00:00:46.950> can

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it's a very cool glitch beach guys can

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's a very cool glitch beach guys can
get<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> mo<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.180> weapons<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> get

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
get out get a mo get weapons and get

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.360 
get out get a mo get weapons and get
right<00:00:48.930> back<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.829> doing<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.190> here

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
right back into it I'm doing it here

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
right back into it I'm doing it here
twice<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.120> try<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.860> smooth<00:00:53.190> recording

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
twice in one try or one smooth recording

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
twice in one try or one smooth recording
without<00:00:53.730> having<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> stop<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> again

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
without having to stop and do it again

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
without having to stop and do it again
so<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.039> easy<00:00:56.489> glitch<00:00:56.760> whether<00:00:57.390> one

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so it is a very easy glitch whether one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
so it is a very easy glitch whether one
person<00:00:57.930> can't<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> can

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
person can't be in this because you can

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.410 
person can't be in this because you can
move<00:00:59.070> over<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.789> father<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.329> let

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
move over to the right father and let

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
move over to the right father and let
another<00:01:00.600> person<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.190> guys<00:01:02.280> are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
another person in and if you guys are

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
another person in and if you guys are
playing<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.820> more<00:01:03.030> than<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.300> person<00:01:03.329> all

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
playing with more than one person all

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
playing with more than one person all
you<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> corner

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you want to just have them in the corner

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.890 
you want to just have them in the corner
where<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.250> friends<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:06.479> zombies<00:01:06.780> will

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
where my friends are some zombies will

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
where my friends are some zombies will
go<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.439> many<00:01:07.680> most<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> them

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
go to them but not many most of them

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.530 
go to them but not many most of them
will<00:01:08.280> come<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.360> least<00:01:09.479> the

will come to you or at least the
majority<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> couple<00:01:11.430> will

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
majority of them will so a couple will

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.130 
majority of them will so a couple will
go<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.390> keep<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> mind<00:01:12.960> but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
go to them so just keep that in mind but

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
go to them so just keep that in mind but
most<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> zombies<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> you
