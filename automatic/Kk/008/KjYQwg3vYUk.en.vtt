00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.260
 anime constant moneymaker 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.260
 st 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.880
 stops here gets one from me 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.939
 kalaschnikow because here at the block is only 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.070
 the kanak attack hello my ladies and 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.930
 mens i saw anime kanako unbelievable 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 we cracked the 500 cars 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.369
 It would be merely to thank you for the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.649
 blatant supporter and for a support 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.719
 generally for that I was a little one 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.360
 special theory or guess for you 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.620
 maybe one or the other 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.770
 interested and catch 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.579
 chapter 795 to what is currently current 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.109
 Is seen on his cloud island or 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.579
 on a cloud hensel 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.339
 I 'm not saying it's his 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.620
 many say it's skype but hello 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.179
 Since when would skype be so small me 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.949
 think it's an island through this 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.960
 What is one wearing balloons? 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.879
 I also think that's it 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.769
 a special gas that you moon 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.930
 people used to have from the time of 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.760
 moon to earth or from the earth 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.710
 to get to the moon what you too 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.870
 possibly seen in park cover 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.760
 pages and the grass it determines so 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.740
 especially because I wonder why 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.570
 Balance does not burst or a gas 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.460
 lose that they become smaller because 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 it looks like they already are one 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.049
 Whole hovering on the hover and the 10,000 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.909
 meter high I mean good it is 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.320
 Thousands of balloons but that has 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.329
 nothing to do with it normally 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.460
 would have to burst in real life 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.130
 he certainly says many that a manga 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.020
 all about natural and and and yes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.820
 but of course there are monkey's 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.530
 normal balloons we know and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.310
 just eventually shrink or 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.590
 burst 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.170
 That's why a special glass thinks now 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.549
 which brings very strong and fly 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.560
 or, if necessary, a hensel to 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.600
 flying brings or hovering like you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.969
 it also takes and the balloons 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.619
 stabilized I think that frankie what 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.390
 will have to do with these gas 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.070
 but not only when he is strong 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.679
 he may discover the gas 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.549
 equip its order specifically to the 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.770
 moon to arrive 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.710
 I think there will be a monday 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.359
 because the straw hats were on 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.060
 the blue sea then on a cloud 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.530
 island then on an underwater island 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.990
 The freshly named island is called 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.600
 so to get to scribd they had 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 use the lockscreen and the mary 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.020
 had extra two wings installed 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.590
 get them in the air 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.209
 stable 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.860
 sighted and uses the momentum up 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.420
 to get to the top and not like that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 other ships in the nock upstream 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 People get lost like that and so do fish 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.260
 island they had their sunny extra 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.239
 stories have what the motherfucker 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.129
 Of course, this has been done rally 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.019
 one has also seen the weltbild that 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.090
 is a bubble that does not burst no matter how 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.769
 Deep you submerge and only then can you 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.290
 also only to fish people island 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.629
 arrive so I think that there is also a 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.390
 way to the moon is not like enel 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.340
 with his ashes maxim and his 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.099
 ability to make the thing fly 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.019
 and then comes to the moon but with the 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.819
 balloons are sunny 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.099
 and then go up to the moon 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.170
 Of course, many are asking like that now 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.840
 end of job he is taller and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.660
 heavier and the island is hovering 10,000 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.370
 meter high what I want is that 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.530
 if the island had more balloons 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.870
 then even the island would even 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.120
 hover even higher than you can 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.829
 adjust it as you would like it to 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.370
 example the sunny weighs less than 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.349
 its tenth 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.450
 because she is smaller and now if that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.239
 sunny so many balloons in quantity would have 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.859
 like the island where it is on this would be 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.870
 for example, hovering higher 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.579
 because the weight also has something to say 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.650
 then, for example, it would be easy now 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.600
 the sunny 20,000 meter height from instead 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.220
 10,000 meters altitude than the island 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.769
 maybe you can use the balloons 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.840
 somehow with fire on amplifier like that 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.819
 similar to a hot air balloon because you 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.590
 here in the cover pages has seen that it 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.720
 may flaming can of course 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.180
 it was also difficult but the tips 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.220
 have such a slight wave shape that is 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.650
 that it looks like fire and he does 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.709
 not as sharp as spears you 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.870
 otherwise , as well as you must know yourself 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.150
 raffi and the others equip themselves 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.310
 Certainly like the kite people, so to speak 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.590
 put on a space suit so that they are up there 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.090
 but maybe it's robbie 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.280
 which probably also with the too 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.310
 one of the moon has to do the meat 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.420
 as the only one to breathe straw hats 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.079
 can be so in the universe 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.510
 So survival can be done without spacesuit types 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.250
 can be tough times your own 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.139
 race that can survive in space and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.240
 where maybe the information comes from what 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.370
 it really is or what it is 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.310
 with those who have what he eats where 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.080
 he could where he comes also adopted 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.970
 fulfill your dream on the moon because 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.040
 she can see the world from there and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.360
 then the most detailed world map of all 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 can draw times 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.570
 how do you like my theory? 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.220
 friends has already failed better 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.850
 and please do not forget to subscribe
