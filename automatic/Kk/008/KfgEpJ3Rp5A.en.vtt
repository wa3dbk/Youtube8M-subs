00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 well here we have run a game that 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.980
 comes to try to be a horror game 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.040
 but get the opposite effect here 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.889
 we are in the middle of what seems to be 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 a fenced and asphalted industrial zone 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 with a dirty lampposts and good we go 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.140
 pulling forward discovering this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.269
 haze and basically juice is not about 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.300
 of nothing more and nothing less than doing that and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.609
 the going to go forward walking 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.920
 supposedly we are chasing a 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.560
 ghost 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.540
 a spirit a demon that loves us 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.540
 liquidate I guess if we see it 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.400
 good and the problem will appear 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.610
 it is that the ghost is apart 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.130
 to be ridiculously 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.970
 and the list apart from being ridiculously 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.800
 ugly without grace above the subnormal 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.500
 let's say the science faculty 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.440
 ghostly was the one who got the worst note 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.760
 but from far and above the fool yes that 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.970
 they say it gets stuck in some 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.350
 place is not that it has disappeared 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.740
 no it's not that it gets stuck in a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 fence because it is that it is subnormal 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.200
 deep subnormal sack the worst notes 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.540
 and here we have it in this game is called 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.280
 Run Run Run Run Find you and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 I do not know what it is because the only time 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.220
 I played it does not come to me until it goes down 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.470
 wonderful again good is worth very much 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 well it is acojonante 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.700
 two minutes of video and that's it 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.460
 a very difficult game as we see and very 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.070
 scary in the eye because ghost is 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.080
 very smart as I said then 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.330
 walking with a kind of supposedly 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.250
 it's a city but good the truth is 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.990
 which are several and go without further fences and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.430
 has no more the city parts very 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.810
 small that has gone there we see it the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.900
 subnormal of the monster viera lectiva 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.490
 stands is not an eye slider the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.750
 beach in which the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.450
 that I would have to run towards me 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.840
 but stays behind against varela streetlamp 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.840
 let's do what 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.780
 well it has disappeared because there was up 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 there 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410
 uy 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.260
 although fear we are going to bring 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 seriously it is a regrettable game 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.240
 to see creator of the game to see creator I 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.680
 I understand the effort involved in creating a 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 videogame of this style but it is that I 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 I say you take the engine of 'duke nukem 3d 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 you change the sounds that is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.900
 easy to do it from this then 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.940
 change to edit a map 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.970
 nice cool with a digital star that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.600
 it's easy and I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 you change some textures some sounds and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.270
 you already have a more terrifying game than 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.480
 I'm serious because I have 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.300
 done I've done many never stopped and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.360
 It is very easy to do it 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 but it's not that I do not understand this what the fuck 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.810
 it is this 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.120
 at least if it was a silhouette of a being 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.180
 demonic but it has nothing 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.090
 is stuck in the eye eye lamp that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.690
 To be smarter 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 is that you see it is not scary 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 uy that touches you 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 but he is a little boy who pursues 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.170
 credits but nothing 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.510
 I do not know, I do not know the truth 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.890
 because there are people who bother to do 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.890
 things like this industry 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.330
 and well, nothing we are going to do is put 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.680
 here inside but also so that not 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.060
 have is here inside and is that the bug 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.550
 is not capable of minds here and then 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.070
 jam 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.570
 can be seen here inside will live a path 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.550
 no way out I'm lost so if I do not 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.550
 will be able to enter if it is a normal 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.460
 on a wall in order here we have room the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.700
 truth is that it is better that the creator 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.980
 of the game 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.780
 I reconsidered this of making games 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.780
 because not because
