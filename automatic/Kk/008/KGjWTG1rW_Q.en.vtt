00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 people who do not put on gloves 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.129
 Whites of Iwata Waiting has not found 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.129
 none samÃ¡n 2 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.170
 what are we going to find 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.170
 inside the paper 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 next to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.870
 and that made it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 next to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.720
 and let's see first 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 how transparent 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 the nintendo network premium this is the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.640
 discount that has confirmed you is 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 of 8 percent of all purchases of 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.119
 internet internet that we make it 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.870
 give us back the money to spend the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.880
 future store games 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.180
 the nintendo land would of course not have 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 presented 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.960
 nothing else of destruction is the cartridge and 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.960
 the stars for the pro painting 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.580
 and cables 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.580
 the power supply 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.009
 big always external so it does not occupy 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.009
 space inside the mountains 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 the command charging cable 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.000
 support 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.000
 of the console 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.770
 the sense bar now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.770
 just in case you do not have the wild 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.110
 more support than the hdmi cable very 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.110
 important for the online experience 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.129
 Y 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 the command loader the support each 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.470
 it's time to load the command to the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470
 example 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.850
 and this and now we are going to give strong 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.980
 something interesting this seems to be more 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.520
 chubby this is the console let's see 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.520
 first the command 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.110
 black as you remember because it's the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.110
 premium version that comes in black 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.849
 beautiful 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 forever 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.810
 because after the connections 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.690
 we already have the wii and we will 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.910
 play immediately to have them all 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.800

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.950
