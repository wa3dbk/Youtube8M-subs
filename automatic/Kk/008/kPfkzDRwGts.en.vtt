00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.960
 thinking about her 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.170

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:40.000

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.000
 Let's invite in the afternoon. 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:08.370

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:11.010

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.730

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.510
 that you do not have are the ones to touch if you need 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.340
 A little bit more we hit the balance 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:11.739
 end is as follows: 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.739

 use a raw flour 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.990
 There you have to let it be a little. 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:25.090
