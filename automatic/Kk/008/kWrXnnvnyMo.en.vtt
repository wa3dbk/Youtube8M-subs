 hello alexander good afternoon 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 as far as I know you Rostovites, but in general 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 how often do you manage to visit 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 Here in the past year, I had a solid 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.030
 tour in america here this year 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.240

 the famous Carnegie Hall hall is of course 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 same very big for big for me 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.150
 achievements pride that in general i could 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.220
 break into 1 world stage and in general 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.450
 take abroad is there any difference here 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.990
 when you step 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.940
 here in Russia and abroad 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 mentality they i'm here so glad 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.170
 differ especially in japan they teach 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.350
 great trepidation relate classic 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.470
 music but here lately I notice 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.600
 very interesting trend in particular 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 here is simple and in my hometown people 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.420
 become anything more thin they 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.459
 try to be interested in culture more 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.459
 and it's not just to do what 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.830
 ordinariness she flies and and sometimes 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.650
 annoying but somehow feel 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.870
 feel the strength and energy go on 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.120
 some kind of classic event to me 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.220
 really like the trend people have become 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.890
 pay more attention this of course y 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 the event has become more and the program 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.959
 become more diverse tomorrow will be a concert 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.370
 my recital he has already become 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.880
 in general, even the traditional thing is that 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.160
 what a period of time the devil I left 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.370
 in germany here he came back from me 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.900

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.670
 last year and a half overall I'm pretty 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.320
 actively participate in the concert 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.650

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.490

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.470
 some special teachers were then 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.960

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.390

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.870
 teacher sergey smelly osipenko anniversary 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.780

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.830

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.390
 Sasha is a typical Russian name but 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.310
 It is believed that this is one of the most 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.130
 ancient German cities feel 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.850
