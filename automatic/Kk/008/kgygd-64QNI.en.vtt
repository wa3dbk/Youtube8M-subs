00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
drugs and school and all that stuff that

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.210 
drugs and school and all that stuff that
maybe<00:01:28.690> sounds<00:01:29.080> cliche<00:01:29.440> but<00:01:29.470> we<00:01:29.860> need<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.100> get

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
maybe sounds cliche but we need to get

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.350 
maybe sounds cliche but we need to get
out<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.460> talk<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.670> kids<00:01:30.880> about<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
out and talk to kids about that

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.389 
out and talk to kids about that
especially<00:01:31.899> now<00:01:32.380> me<00:01:32.679> having<00:01:33.009> is<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.340> think

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
especially now me having is I think

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.410 
especially now me having is I think
that's<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.880> most<00:01:33.970> important<00:01:34.450> thing<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.600> do

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.399 

into<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.630> groove<00:01:41.900> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.649 

I<00:01:48.499> think<00:01:49.249> that<00:01:49.369> what<00:01:49.939> we're<00:01:50.060> trying<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.329> do<00:01:50.479> is

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
I think that what we're trying to do is

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.830 
I think that what we're trying to do is
take<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.079> one<00:01:51.289> step<00:01:51.619> further<00:01:52.219> we<00:01:53.179> we've<00:01:53.569> grown

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
take the one step further we we've grown

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.690 
take the one step further we we've grown
as<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.429> franchise<00:01:55.659> our<00:01:56.659> crowd<00:01:57.049> base<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:58.399> area

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
as a franchise our crowd base the area

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.760 
as a franchise our crowd base the area
that<00:01:58.880> we're<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.179> but<00:01:59.719> we're<00:01:59.869> really<00:02:00.109> taking<00:02:00.469> it

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
that we're in but we're really taking it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.410 
that we're in but we're really taking it
to<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:00.979> level<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.459> we<00:02:01.670> really<00:02:02.060> want<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.329> get
