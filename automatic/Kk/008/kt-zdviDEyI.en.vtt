00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
jungle picture because it's going to be

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.350 
jungle picture because it's going to be
really<00:03:18.010> covered<00:03:18.610> with<00:03:18.790> plants<00:03:19.090> and

really covered with plants and

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.020 
really covered with plants and
vegetation<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> future<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.490> else<00:03:21.760> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
vegetation in the future and I else I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.660 
vegetation in the future and I else I
can<00:03:22.390> add<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.900> bush<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:29.370> added<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.520> the

see<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:36.370> use<00:03:36.580> Dodge<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.510> brighten<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
see we use Dodge to brighten the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.300 
see we use Dodge to brighten the
sunlight<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.620> can<00:03:38.770> see<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.160> little

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
sunlight so you can see it a little

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.690 
sunlight so you can see it a little
better

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
better

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.740 
better
oh<00:03:46.620> yeah<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.710> use<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.280> blur<00:03:48.460> tool<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:49.090> make<00:03:49.570> it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
oh yeah I use the blur tool to make it

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.480 
oh yeah I use the blur tool to make it
look<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.590> sharp<00:03:50.920> on<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.310> and

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
look like it's not so sharp on it and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.890 
look like it's not so sharp on it and
kind<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.940> blended<00:03:52.270> in<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.480> little<00:03:52.720> better<00:03:52.780> with

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
kind of blended in a little better with

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.090 
kind of blended in a little better with
the<00:03:53.050> background<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:55.440> start<00:03:56.440> off<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.980> was

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
the background and start off that was

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.500 
the background and start off that was
our<00:03:57.250> original<00:03:57.580> picture<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> honey<00:03:58.300> badger

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
our original picture of the honey badger

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:10.230 
our original picture of the honey badger
and<00:03:59.320> so<00:04:06.900> as<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.140> heard<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:08.620> our<00:04:08.770> pretty<00:04:09.640> sick

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
and so as you heard in our pretty sick

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.520 
and so as you heard in our pretty sick
rap<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:12.580> didn't<00:04:12.910> grow<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.960> metaphor<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.440> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
rap it didn't grow as a metaphor it to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.229 
rap it didn't grow as a metaphor it to
eight<00:04:14.650> foot<00:04:14.860> two<00:04:15.160> but<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:16.060> grew<00:04:16.270> bigger<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:17.130> it

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
eight foot two but it grew bigger and it

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.180 
eight foot two but it grew bigger and it
got<00:04:19.239> bigger<00:04:19.980> claws<00:04:20.980> got<00:04:21.280> bigger<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:23.280> its<00:04:24.280> tail

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
got bigger claws got bigger and its tail

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.260 
got bigger claws got bigger and its tail
got<00:04:27.190> fabricated<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.500> what<00:04:30.190> Klaus<00:04:30.490> did<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.120> was

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
got fabricated so what Klaus did it was

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.420 
got fabricated so what Klaus did it was
it<00:04:31.420> helped<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.170> cut<00:04:33.070> through<00:04:33.220> all<00:04:33.250> the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
it helped it to cut through all the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.060 
it helped it to cut through all the
heavy<00:04:33.610> vegetation<00:04:33.790> around<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.810> say<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:35.950> it's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
heavy vegetation around so say if it's

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.800 
heavy vegetation around so say if it's
running<00:04:36.310> after<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.820> one<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.060> its<00:04:37.090> prey<00:04:37.510> it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
running after or one of its prey it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.150 
running after or one of its prey it
could<00:04:38.020> run<00:04:38.740> run<00:04:38.950> run<00:04:39.190> slash<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.710> its<00:04:41.950> teeth

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
could run run run slash and its teeth

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.720 
could run run run slash and its teeth
held<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:43.080> munch<00:04:44.080> on<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.590> eat<00:04:44.770> better<00:04:45.310> and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
held it to munch on and eat better and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.340 
held it to munch on and eat better and
bigger<00:04:47.520> animals<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.020> detention

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
bigger animals and in the detention

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.530 
bigger animals and in the detention
areas<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.340> what<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.580> did<00:04:51.670> pretty<00:04:51.970> much<00:04:52.090> was

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
areas and so what I did pretty much was

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.220 
areas and so what I did pretty much was
I<00:04:53.460> took<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.760> all<00:04:55.060> these<00:04:55.210> adjustment<00:04:56.020> curve

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
I took just all these adjustment curve

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.080 
I took just all these adjustment curve
layers<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.860> all<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.040> stuff

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.540 

almost<00:05:01.419> everything<00:05:01.900> around<00:05:02.139> it<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:02.800> made<00:05:03.160> all

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
almost everything around it and made all

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.210 
almost everything around it and made all
the<00:05:04.590> details<00:05:05.669> look<00:05:06.669> more<00:05:07.510> like<00:05:07.690> it's<00:05:07.870> into<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
the details look more like it's into the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.340
