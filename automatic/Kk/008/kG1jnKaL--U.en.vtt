00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 it is our beloved's birthday 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.350

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 white and I want to tell you that I love you and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.980
 I admire a lot of lemon and loved equally 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.239
 please receive many times many 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.310
 arms of this production that so much 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.720
 he wants so it's good to celebrate 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.880
 we have a chocolate mousse with 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.630
 olive oil that is incredibly 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.870
 rich but I need thick to beat and 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.540
 clear 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.540
 and add sugar in the form of dew 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.909
 okay 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.430
 I'll wait until they have children 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.080
 firm is very important because 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.560
 remember that the clear ones the only thing that 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.560
 do you have 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.420
 air 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.689
 they are composed of pure water but I am 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 adding pure air very I come 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:42.140
 I have two teaspoons of boiling water 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.140
 and I'm going to put the soluble coffee to undo 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.659
 ready we are ready in the heart 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.659
 ok not going this goes very well I do not know if 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.319
 everything that gives 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.990
 to have firm hard fixes like 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.440
 if it were meringue like it was a cloud 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.640
 of beautiful 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.450
 I love how they begin to transform 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.450
 the ingredients and how it was made as 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.640
 pastry is full of these elements 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.530
 wonderful 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.569
 well how is it changing how is it going 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 changing completely they are breaking 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.370
 the sugar crystals and go 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.900
 becoming little much lighter and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.340
 together with the air they are doing this 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.950
 delicious meringue 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.770
 I would like you to do it in the hands 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 we do not do much also because 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.060
 we are in the tradition is much more 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.760
 quick not yet 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.940
 and nothing more what a delight there are 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 Now I'm going to get this out 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.100
 they are already listed I am working at 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.860
 backwards this is very funny I'm going to put 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.980
 again another goal in front 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.080
 you are going to put there I will put the buds 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.800
 the yolks the balls to batiste 18 yolks 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.050
 separately separately very well and the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.910
 bud also upload this piece of paper if you 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.760
 like here do not think it 's because 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.350
 others doing that suddenly does not arrive 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.730
 to the bottom 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.200
 this asthma we have to put 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.200
 these are thanks 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.310
 there's a sound here that I do not like and it's 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.780
 Look, this part is now separated 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.660
 if you are getting to know your girls 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.530
 okay 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.410
 ready ready manny ok 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.970
 now let's beat this section pale 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.780
 I'm going to add sugar again 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.780
 in the form of dew 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.709
 little by little we will be adding up 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.709
 that are failed 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.599
 it's a knot that I'm going to tell you something 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.360
 important I always say that I do not know 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.349
 consume the buds of cities 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.040
 raw 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.840
 there may be salmonella but this bus is 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.500
 done as really do 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.130
 mute musicians whether they are pure 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.780
 egg is never the engraved whipped cream and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.780
 less grenetine 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.340
 there we are 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.380
 and chocolate have melted me here that 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.090
 you can see it 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.280
 the melted chocolate says the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.020
 microwave emissions look very easy 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.750
 but they have to be checking every 30 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.280
 seconds because menezes because it burns 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.470
 remember that the microwave reaches 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.540
 center of the food and then it spreads 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.450
 that's how it was discovered because a 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.460
 sir in an oven they had were 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.770
 doing an experiment I do not remember 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.720
 exactly where but how is it discovered 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 why the gentleman decays chocolate over 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.710
 that consists of way suddenly is your 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.710
 well like having the microwave 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.680

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.150
 I'll tell you about this business because if 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.400
 also as well as what are the stories 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.410
 that also recognize yes because the 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.380
 brother we are already like something normal not 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.360
 I know how they began operating the the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.400
 guns of hair is not like to 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.010
 that everything has a story no and that 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.310
 it's fun we 're going to put oil 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.310
 olive 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.370
 I'm going to put the zest 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.660
 a pinch of salt 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.810
 and I'm going to put the coffee that I put in a 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.810
 beginning 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.900
 I have a spatula 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.990
 I'm going to raise my container a little 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.790
 what wealth love is delicious 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.030
 completely different from what we are 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.030
 accustomed 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.980
 and you will love it 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.290
 it's at your own risk so they say 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.800
 when they serve it to you why because 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.340
 the yolks of the egg whites are cooked 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.340
 okay 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.540
 my parents are your spatulas and although that 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.290
