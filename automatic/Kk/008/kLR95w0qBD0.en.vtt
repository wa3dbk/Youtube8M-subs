00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and we simply don't understand what

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
and we simply don't understand what
drives<00:01:16.409> those<00:01:16.860> cycles<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
drives those cycles but we can see that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050 
drives those cycles but we can see that
they're<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> lake

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
they're there because if you go to lake

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.080 
they're there because if you go to lake
sediments<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.080> ice<00:01:22.439> cores<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
sediments and ice cores you can see the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
sediments and ice cores you can see the
patterns<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> their<00:01:24.840> harmonics<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.850> are

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
patterns and their harmonics that are

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
patterns and their harmonics that are
repeating<00:01:28.189> now<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.549> fact<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.630> scientist<00:01:31.430> not

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
repeating now in fact one scientist not

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090 
repeating now in fact one scientist not
working<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.060> computers<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:34.380> working<00:01:35.070> with

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
working with computers but working with

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.060 
working with computers but working with
Fibonacci<00:01:35.400> numbers<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:37.290> used<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> work

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
Fibonacci numbers and he used to work

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830 
Fibonacci numbers and he used to work
very<00:01:38.310> closely<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.820> NASA<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
very closely with NASA actually but I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
very closely with NASA actually but I
think<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:41.009> their<00:01:41.159> noses<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
think he kind of got up their noses a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.020 
think he kind of got up their noses a
bit<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:43.020> could<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.500> predict<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bit because they could not predict the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
bit because they could not predict the
amplitudes<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.170> solar<00:01:46.439> cycles<00:01:46.979> are

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
amplitudes of these solar cycles are

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.889 
amplitudes of these solar cycles are
actually<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:47.850> important<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.600> they

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
actually very important because they

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.580 
actually very important because they
determine<00:01:49.350> space<00:01:49.649> weather<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.850> kind<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
determine space weather the kind of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.929 
determine space weather the kind of
electromagnetic<00:01:52.590> pulses<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> affect

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
electromagnetic pulses that affect

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
electromagnetic pulses that affect
satellites<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.350> very

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
satellites and it's very it's very

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
satellites and it's very it's very
important<00:01:56.070> economically<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
important economically to know what the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
important economically to know what the
Sun<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> doing<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.500> when<00:01:59.930> he<00:02:00.930> could<00:02:01.170> predict<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
Sun is doing a when he could predict the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.690 
Sun is doing a when he could predict the
amplitudes<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> cycles<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.549> he<00:02:05.549> could

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
amplitudes of the cycles and he could

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
amplitudes of the cycles and he could
also<00:02:05.850> predict<00:02:06.329> another<00:02:06.450> phenomena<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.380> the

whole planet and again there are

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.440 
whole planet and again there are
economic<00:02:19.370> reasons<00:02:19.670> why<00:02:19.790> it'd<00:02:19.850> be<00:02:20.060> very<00:02:20.090> good

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
economic reasons why it'd be very good

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.780 
economic reasons why it'd be very good
to<00:02:20.570> predict<00:02:20.930> when<00:02:21.080> an<00:02:21.230> El<00:02:21.350> Nino<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.740> coming<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
to predict when an El Nino is coming and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.650 
to predict when an El Nino is coming and
he<00:02:22.940> could<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:25.210> eventually<00:02:26.210> fell<00:02:26.480> out

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
he could do that and eventually fell out

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.680 
he could do that and eventually fell out
with<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.310> establishment<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.700> set<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.570> his

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
with the establishment and set up his

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.120 
with the establishment and set up his
own<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:30.170> research<00:02:30.770> group<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:32.180> 2003<00:02:33.130> he

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
own little research group and in 2003 he

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.010 
own little research group and in 2003 he
wrote<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> paper<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.270> international

wrote a paper in the international
peer-reviewed<00:02:36.620> literature<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
peer-reviewed literature as so this is

said there will be a really big one in

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.760 
said there will be a really big one in
98<00:02:48.050> he<00:02:48.440> said<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.800> before<00:02:48.980> before<00:02:49.580> 98<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.770> in

98 he said that before before 98 and in
2002<00:02:52.670> he<00:02:52.940> predicted<00:02:53.360> both<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.750> those<00:02:53.870> El<00:02:54.110> Ninos

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
2002 he predicted both of those El Ninos

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.970 
2002 he predicted both of those El Ninos
and<00:02:56.200> he<00:02:57.200> said<00:02:57.410> after<00:02:57.770> 2002<00:02:59.170> that<00:03:00.170> El<00:03:00.410> Nino<00:03:00.770> will

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
and he said after 2002 that El Nino will

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.470 
and he said after 2002 that El Nino will
mask<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:02.080> global<00:03:03.080> cooling<00:03:03.320> caused<00:03:03.830> by<00:03:04.700> fall<00:03:05.150> in

mask a global cooling caused by fall in

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.510 
mask a global cooling caused by fall in
the<00:03:05.930> electromagnetic<00:03:06.320> cycle<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.250> Sun

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
the electromagnetic cycle of the Sun

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.310 
the electromagnetic cycle of the Sun
which<00:03:07.970> he<00:03:08.120> predicted<00:03:08.570> he<00:03:08.720> successfully

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
which he predicted he successfully

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.780 
which he predicted he successfully
predicted<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.880> he<00:03:11.000> said<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.390> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
predicted that and he said that the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.220 
predicted that and he said that the
cycle<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.910> we're<00:03:14.120> waiting<00:03:14.240> for<00:03:14.510> now<00:03:14.930> which

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
cycle that we're waiting for now which

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.140 
cycle that we're waiting for now which
is<00:03:15.350> called<00:03:15.590> cycle<00:03:15.980> 24<00:03:16.280> will<00:03:16.670> be<00:03:16.820> delayed

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
is called cycle 24 will be delayed

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.310 
is called cycle 24 will be delayed
indeed<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.170> has<00:03:18.350> been<00:03:18.620> delayed<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:21.110> will

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
indeed it has been delayed and it will

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.620 
indeed it has been delayed and it will
be<00:03:21.440> lower<00:03:21.680> than<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.220> previous<00:03:22.640> one<00:03:22.850> now<00:03:23.480> an

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
be lower than the previous one now an

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.540 
be lower than the previous one now an
ass<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:24.020> expecting<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.800> come<00:03:24.830> back<00:03:25.130> up<00:03:25.370> and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
ass are expecting it to come back up and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.220 
ass are expecting it to come back up and
be<00:03:25.640> bigger<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:25.970> we'll<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.900> three<00:03:27.110> or<00:03:27.170> four

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
be bigger so we'll know in three or four

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.070 
be bigger so we'll know in three or four
years<00:03:27.530> time<00:03:27.890> but<00:03:28.880> he's<00:03:29.180> also<00:03:29.390> he<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.930> also

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
years time but he's also he was also

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.000 
years time but he's also he was also
writing<00:03:30.500> another<00:03:30.920> thing<00:03:31.220> he<00:03:31.340> said<00:03:32.080> after<00:03:33.080> 2002

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
writing another thing he said after 2002

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.000 
writing another thing he said after 2002
you<00:03:34.190> won't<00:03:34.400> see<00:03:34.580> anymore<00:03:34.820> el<00:03:35.060> ninos<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:36.830> will

you won't see anymore el ninos you will

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.850 
you won't see anymore el ninos you will

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
get a condition known as la ninia where

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.850 
get a condition known as la ninia where
the<00:03:39.950> pacific<00:03:40.340> ocean<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.730> very<00:03:40.910> cold<00:03:41.210> and<00:03:41.860> he

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the pacific ocean is very cold and he

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.260 
the pacific ocean is very cold and he
said<00:03:43.070> eventually<00:03:43.370> by<00:03:44.470> 2007<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.910> will<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.240> a

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
said eventually by 2007 there will be a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.360 
said eventually by 2007 there will be a

temperature<00:04:24.530> way<00:04:24.919> above<00:04:25.210> 1998<00:04:26.210> we

temperature way above 1998 we

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.150 
temperature way above 1998 we
is<00:04:26.639> still<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.900> world<00:04:28.139> record<00:04:28.560> temperature

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
is still the world record temperature

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.770 
is still the world record temperature
and<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:31.440> will<00:04:31.650> they<00:04:32.129> were<00:04:32.250> expecting<00:04:32.819> El<00:04:33.150> Nino

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
and so will they were expecting El Nino

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.279 
and so will they were expecting El Nino
and<00:04:33.990> world<00:04:34.440> record<00:04:34.970> what<00:04:35.970> did<00:04:36.120> we<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.449> land

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and world record what did we have land

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:43.119
