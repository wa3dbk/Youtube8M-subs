dolls<00:04:30.710> she's<00:04:31.250> got<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.460> ice<00:04:31.580> slippers<00:04:32.030> on<00:04:32.120> that

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
dolls she's got the ice slippers on that

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.460 
dolls she's got the ice slippers on that
one<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.540> it'd<00:04:32.630> have<00:04:32.720> been<00:04:32.750> nice<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:32.990> see<00:04:33.290> them

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
one so it'd have been nice to see them

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.810 
one so it'd have been nice to see them
carried<00:04:33.800> over<00:04:33.920> into<00:04:34.190> this<00:04:34.400> because<00:04:34.700> that's

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
carried over into this because that's

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.690 
carried over into this because that's
kind<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.380> again<00:04:36.380> part<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:37.010> iconic<00:04:37.370> scene

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
kind of again part of that iconic scene

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.580 
kind of again part of that iconic scene
but<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:37.940> guess<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:39.139> can't<00:04:39.350> have<00:04:39.440> everything

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
but I guess you can't have everything

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
but I guess you can't have everything
because<00:04:40.100> adult<00:04:40.340> itself<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.820> really<00:04:41.030> really

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
because adult itself is really really

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.060 
because adult itself is really really
nice<00:04:41.419> now<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:42.020> does<00:04:42.230> sing<00:04:42.500> as<00:04:42.710> well<00:04:42.860> so
