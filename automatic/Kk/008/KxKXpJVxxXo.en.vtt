CrossFit<00:00:06.330> endurance<00:00:06.690> we're<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.379> talk

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
CrossFit endurance we're going to talk

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.499 
CrossFit endurance we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.649> warm-ups<00:00:08.550> specific<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:10.190> running<00:00:11.509> and

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
about warm-ups specific to running and

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.240 
about warm-ups specific to running and
you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.750> vary<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.380> depending<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
you can vary this depending on the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.640 
you can vary this depending on the
length<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:15.389> intensity<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.500> you're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
length or intensity of what it is you're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.439 
length or intensity of what it is you're
gonna<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.000> this

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
gonna do but think of it like this

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.380 
gonna do but think of it like this
the<00:00:18.900> shorter<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> greater<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the shorter we go the greater the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.849 
the shorter we go the greater the
warm-up<00:00:21.720> needs<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> better<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
warm-up needs to be the better the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.560 
warm-up needs to be the better the
warm-up<00:00:23.160> needs<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.029> longer<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.539> go

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
warm-up needs to be the longer we go

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.880 
warm-up needs to be the longer we go
like<00:00:25.170> let's<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.529> say<00:00:25.590> you're<00:00:25.680> gonna<00:00:25.740> go

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
like let's just say you're gonna go

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650 
like let's just say you're gonna go
around<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> hundred<00:00:26.189> miles<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:27.150> don't<00:00:27.510> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
around a hundred miles you don't it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
around a hundred miles you don't it's
not<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.410> warm<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.279> you're

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
not that you don't go warm up but you're

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.679 
not that you don't go warm up but you're
not<00:00:29.640> necessarily<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> need<00:00:30.420> something

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
not necessarily going to need something

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
not necessarily going to need something
to<00:00:30.840> warm<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> doesn't<00:00:31.769> make<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> whole<00:00:32.099> lot

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to warm up this doesn't make a whole lot

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.910 
to warm up this doesn't make a whole lot
of<00:00:32.460> sense<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> real<00:00:34.110> big<00:00:34.469> warmup

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of sense to do it in a real big warmup

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
of sense to do it in a real big warmup
for<00:00:34.980> something<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:36.420> your<00:00:36.540> pace

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
for something like that where your pace

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.209 
for something like that where your pace
is<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.140> start<00:00:37.440> you're<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.860> gonna<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.190> very

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
is gonna start you're not gonna be very

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.160 
is gonna start you're not gonna be very
fast<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:39.750> gonna<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:40.020> do

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
fast we're if we're gonna go do

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
fast we're if we're gonna go do
something<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.620> 400<00:00:41.040> meter<00:00:41.190> repeats<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
something like 400 meter repeats or to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
something like 400 meter repeats or to
hundreds<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.719> even<00:00:42.750> 100s

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
hundreds or even 100s

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
hundreds or even 100s
you're<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> pretty<00:00:44.550> big<00:00:45.320> warm-up

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you're gonna need a pretty big warm-up

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130 
you're gonna need a pretty big warm-up
and<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and we will get into the kind of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
and we will get into the kind of
dynamics<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
dynamics of that so what we like to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.600 
dynamics of that so what we like to
start<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.949> well<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
start off with well look at this in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.400 
start off with well look at this in
terms<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:55.070> 5<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> 10<00:00:56.430> minutes<00:00:56.760> depending<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
terms of 5 to 10 minutes depending on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
terms of 5 to 10 minutes depending on
what<00:00:58.410> you're<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.010> say<00:00:59.219> 5k

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
what you're gonna do let's just say 5k

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.860 
what you're gonna do let's just say 5k
maybe<00:01:00.480> we'd<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.230> 5<00:01:02.070> minutes<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.660> 10

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
maybe we'd go at 5 minutes and the 10

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.210 
maybe we'd go at 5 minutes and the 10
minute<00:01:04.140> piece<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.710> something<00:01:04.949> for

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
minute piece would be something for

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
minute piece would be something for
that's<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.670> shorter<00:01:06.000> maybe<00:01:06.180> 800<00:01:06.720> s<00:01:06.810> or

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's gonna be shorter maybe 800 s or

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510 
that's gonna be shorter maybe 800 s or
below<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:07.860> gonna<00:01:07.950> need<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.369> bit

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
below or you're gonna need a little bit

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
below or you're gonna need a little bit
more<00:01:08.760> time<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.409> warmed<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
more time to get a little warmed up so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.789 
more time to get a little warmed up so
we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> 5<00:01:11.549> 10<00:01:11.850> minutes<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
we're going to 5 10 minutes of

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.969 
we're going to 5 10 minutes of
increasing<00:01:17.299> pace<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.560> increase

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
increasing pace you want to increase

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
increasing pace you want to increase
that<00:01:20.040> pace<00:01:20.520> towards<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> end<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.990> you're

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that pace towards the end where you're

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
that pace towards the end where you're
kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.920> top<00:01:23.189> speed<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.330> good

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
kind of not at top speed but at a good

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
kind of not at top speed but at a good
pace<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> start<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:25.770> real

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
pace where you want to start off real

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
pace where you want to start off real
easy<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.549> steadily<00:01:27.150> increase<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
easy and then steadily increase this is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.520 
easy and then steadily increase this is
just<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> general<00:01:29.189> warm-up<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.630> secondly

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
just a general warm-up to start secondly

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.850 
just a general warm-up to start secondly
we<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.159> into<00:01:32.549> 5<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.990> 10<00:01:34.200> minutes<00:01:34.650> of

mobility and if you've ever worked or
you've<00:01:42.600> ever<00:01:42.720> heard<00:01:43.170> single<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.130> with

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you've ever heard single what I do with

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
you've ever heard single what I do with
my<00:01:44.460> athletes<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.750> alright<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.350> I've

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
my athletes is it alright when I've

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
my athletes is it alright when I've
talked<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.860> target<00:01:47.310> based<00:01:47.460> training<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
talked about target based training this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.490 
talked about target based training this
is<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.450> everything<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> starts<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
is where everything kind of starts to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.139 
is where everything kind of starts to
fall<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> line<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.430> target<00:01:50.909> where<00:01:51.060> we

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
fall in line with that target where we

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
fall in line with that target where we
look<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> holes<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.130> we

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
look at the holes that they have but we

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
look at the holes that they have but we
also<00:01:53.430> look<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.720> workout<00:01:55.140> we're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
also look at what the workout we're

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.940 
also look at what the workout we're
doing<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.420> typically<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.600> running<00:01:57.960> our<00:01:58.170> focus

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
doing is typically for running our focus

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
doing is typically for running our focus
would<00:01:59.159> normally<00:01:59.670> probably<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.420> between<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
would normally probably be between the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
would normally probably be between the
ankles<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.100> hips<00:02:02.430> okay<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> look<00:02:03.930> at

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
ankles and the hips okay and I look at

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
ankles and the hips okay and I look at
things<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.409> terms<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> joint<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.310> like

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
things in terms of joint like like

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.119 
things in terms of joint like like
starrett<00:02:06.119> does<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> focus<00:02:07.829> on

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
starrett does so we want to focus on

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.190 
starrett does so we want to focus on
probably<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> hips<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.599> ankles

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
probably the hips the ankles

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.130 
probably the hips the ankles
maybe<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> knees

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
maybe the knees

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
maybe the knees
even<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> shoulders<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
even the shoulders but the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.580 
even the shoulders but the
prioritization<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.990> goes<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
prioritization of that goes with the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.920 
prioritization of that goes with the
athlete<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.250> where<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.760> biggest<00:02:16.030> problems

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
athlete and where the biggest problems

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.680 
athlete and where the biggest problems
lie<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> start<00:02:18.730> with<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.540> want<00:02:19.600> to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
lie so we want to start with we want to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.880 
lie so we want to start with we want to
go<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.050> five<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.470> ten<00:02:20.620> minutes<00:02:20.860> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
go with like five to ten minutes of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.350 
go with like five to ten minutes of
mobility<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.460> story<00:02:21.760> out<00:02:21.880> has<00:02:22.060> plenty<00:02:22.330> of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
mobility and story out has plenty of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.630 
mobility and story out has plenty of
that<00:02:22.420> stuff<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.900> mobility<00:02:23.170> WOD<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.490> go

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
that stuff on mobility WOD so we can go

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.450 
that stuff on mobility WOD so we can go
and<00:02:24.790> check<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.000> stuff<00:02:25.270> out<00:02:25.540> there<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.770> this

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
and check that stuff out there but this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.190 
and check that stuff out there but this
is<00:02:27.520> how<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.150> first<00:02:28.480> start<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.990> off

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
is how we like to first start that off

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.810 
is how we like to first start that off
we<00:02:29.470> go<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.590> five<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.980> 10<00:02:30.160> minutes<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.490> increase

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
we go to five to 10 minutes of increase

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.190 
we go to five to 10 minutes of increase
in<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> pace<00:02:31.240> 5<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.630> 10<00:02:31.780> minutes<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
in the pace 5 to 10 minutes of the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.060 
in the pace 5 to 10 minutes of the
mobility<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:33.430> we're<00:02:33.940> going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.300> into<00:02:35.070> 5

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
mobility then we're going to go into 5

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:47.600 
mobility then we're going to go into 5
to<00:02:36.910> 10<00:02:37.120> minutes<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:38.490> skills<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:43.200> pace

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.710 

increase<00:02:48.930> ok<00:02:49.930> by<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.280> mean<00:02:51.790> we'd<00:02:52.300> be<00:02:52.450> doing

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
increase ok by that I mean we'd be doing

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.949 
increase ok by that I mean we'd be doing
some<00:02:52.900> skill<00:02:53.290> drill<00:02:54.070> stuff<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:55.090> ingrain<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
some skill drill stuff to ingrain the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.780 
some skill drill stuff to ingrain the
type<00:02:56.230> whatever<00:02:56.800> movement<00:02:57.310> we're<00:02:57.430> doing<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
type whatever movement we're doing and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.949 
type whatever movement we're doing and
let's<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.090> say<00:02:58.240> it's<00:02:58.390> running<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:58.840> we're

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
let's just say it's running so we're

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.300 
let's just say it's running so we're
gonna<00:02:59.080> apply<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.410> lot<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.890> drills<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
gonna apply a lot of the drills and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.400 
gonna apply a lot of the drills and
we've<00:03:00.430> got<00:03:00.640> plenty<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.209> drills<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.959> there<00:03:02.230> you

these with some pickups so things like

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.540 
these with some pickups so things like
maybe<00:03:16.420> 100<00:03:17.290> meters<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.480> maybe<00:03:19.480> five<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:21.400> eight

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
maybe 100 meters and maybe five to eight

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.340 
maybe 100 meters and maybe five to eight
of<00:03:21.580> them<00:03:21.820> now<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.720> doesn't<00:03:22.900> mean<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.140> we're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
of them now that doesn't mean that we're

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.320 
of them now that doesn't mean that we're
going<00:03:23.470> out<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.830> running<00:03:23.980> five<00:03:24.250> five<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.180> eight

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
100-meter all-out sprints that means

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.650 
100-meter all-out sprints that means
we're<00:03:27.519> doing<00:03:27.730> some<00:03:27.880> drills<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.360> we're<00:03:28.480> it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
we're doing some drills and we're it

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.660 
we're doing some drills and we're it
weren't<00:03:28.930> kind<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.680> tying<00:03:30.310> those<00:03:30.519> together

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
weren't kind of tying those together

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.640 
weren't kind of tying those together
with<00:03:30.940> some<00:03:31.120> hundreds<00:03:31.600> where<00:03:32.290> we're<00:03:32.440> picking

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
with some hundreds where we're picking

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.320 
with some hundreds where we're picking
up<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:32.980> pace<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.489> getting<00:03:33.820> faster<00:03:34.269> and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
up the pace and getting faster and

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.790 
up the pace and getting faster and
faster<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:34.810> we<00:03:34.930> go<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.410> we've<00:03:35.560> basically

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
faster as we go and so we've basically

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.310 
faster as we go and so we've basically
got<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.610> five<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.030> ten-minute<00:03:37.480> piece<00:03:37.690> where

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
got this five to ten-minute piece where

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.690 
got this five to ten-minute piece where
we're<00:03:38.500> steadily<00:03:38.709> increasing<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.459> stuff

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
we're steadily increasing this stuff

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.940 
we're steadily increasing this stuff
including<00:03:40.360> with<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.600> skill<00:03:40.870> stuff<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.709> also

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
including with the skill stuff we also

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.970 
including with the skill stuff we also
won't<00:03:42.250> want<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.580> throw<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.030> some<00:03:43.590> dynamic

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.490 

range<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.160> motion<00:03:48.550> or<00:03:48.760> mobility<00:03:49.150> stuff<00:03:49.630> just

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
range of motion or mobility stuff just

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.170 
range of motion or mobility stuff just
in<00:03:50.620> case<00:03:50.830> just<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> turn<00:03:51.340> some<00:03:51.550> things<00:03:51.760> back<00:03:51.940> on

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
in case just to turn some things back on

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.150 
in case just to turn some things back on
open<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.019> Hix<00:03:53.170> up<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.410> little<00:03:53.590> more<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:54.040> open

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
open the Hix up a little more you open

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.100 
open the Hix up a little more you open
the<00:03:54.370> calves<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.790> knees<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.330> ankles<00:03:55.360> all<00:03:55.930> that

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
the calves the knees the ankles all that

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.740 
the calves the knees the ankles all that
stuff<00:03:56.410> back<00:03:56.620> up<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:58.030> then<00:03:58.209> like<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.540> give

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
stuff back up we then like to give

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.500 
stuff back up we then like to give
yourselves<00:03:59.140> about<00:03:59.650> five<00:03:59.980> minutes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.150 

rest<00:04:08.510> right<00:04:09.050> before<00:04:09.320> we<00:04:09.440> work<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.740> out<00:04:09.860> okay

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
rest right before we work it out okay

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.090 
rest right before we work it out okay
it's<00:04:10.850> pretty<00:04:11.120> simple<00:04:11.890> but<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:12.950> very

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
it's pretty simple but it's very

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's pretty simple but it's very
effective<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.030> as<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.630> can<00:04:14.810> see<00:04:15.070> we're

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
effective and as you can see we're

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.760 
effective and as you can see we're
looking<00:04:16.340> at<00:04:16.489> anywhere<00:04:16.790> from<00:04:17.030> about<00:04:17.150> 30<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:18.350> 40

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
looking at anywhere from about 30 to 40

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.020 
looking at anywhere from about 30 to 40
minutes<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.130> could<00:04:19.340> potentially<00:04:19.610> be<00:04:19.850> up

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
minutes you could potentially be up

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.660 
minutes you could potentially be up
there<00:04:20.150> for<00:04:20.390> 40<00:04:20.660> minutes<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.989> warming<00:04:21.410> up

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
there for 40 minutes of warming up

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.740 
there for 40 minutes of warming up
before<00:04:22.670> we<00:04:22.790> get<00:04:22.970> going<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.450> one<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.660> the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
before we get going and one of the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.780 
before we get going and one of the
biggest<00:04:23.960> problems<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.800> see<00:04:25.220> with<00:04:25.520> people

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
biggest problems that we see with people

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.850 
biggest problems that we see with people
that<00:04:26.750> we're<00:04:27.020> coaching<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.590> we're<00:04:27.680> working

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
that we're coaching and we're working

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.570 
that we're coaching and we're working
with<00:04:28.040> is<00:04:28.790> their<00:04:29.120> warmup<00:04:29.570> time<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:31.040> also<00:04:31.250> goes

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
with is their warmup time this also goes

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.850 
with is their warmup time this also goes
into<00:04:31.820> our<00:04:32.270> cooldown<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.140> what<00:04:33.500> would<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.740> do

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
into our cooldown so what would we do

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.920 
into our cooldown so what would we do
for<00:04:34.070> cool-down<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.730> kind<00:04:35.300> of<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.570> exact

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
for cool-down and kind of in the exact

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.980 
for cool-down and kind of in the exact
opposite<00:04:36.700> more<00:04:37.700> or<00:04:37.850> less<00:04:38.030> what<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:38.450> like<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.840> do

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
opposite more or less what I like to do

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.050 
opposite more or less what I like to do
is<00:04:39.140> add<00:04:39.290> some<00:04:39.800> sort<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.100> skill<00:04:40.430> work<00:04:40.670> maybe<00:04:40.940> in

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
is add some sort of skill work maybe in

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.210 
is add some sort of skill work maybe in
the<00:04:41.240> less<00:04:41.750> than<00:04:41.960> 5<00:04:42.170> minutes<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.830> but<00:04:42.980> we<00:04:43.070> add

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
the less than 5 minutes of it but we add

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.540 
the less than 5 minutes of it but we add
a<00:04:43.250> little<00:04:43.490> bit<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.760> skill<00:04:44.090> work<00:04:44.620> then<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:46.460> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
a little bit of skill work then just to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.850 
a little bit of skill work then just to
kind<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.880> get<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.510> central<00:04:47.930> nervous<00:04:48.140> system

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
kind of get that central nervous system

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.800 
kind of get that central nervous system
still<00:04:49.160> stimulated<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.330> we<00:04:50.420> want<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.720> get

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
still stimulated then we want to get

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.600 
still stimulated then we want to get
into<00:04:50.960> maybe<00:04:51.230> some<00:04:51.320> mobility<00:04:51.740> or<00:04:52.130> even<00:04:52.430> while

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
into maybe some mobility or even while

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.060 
into maybe some mobility or even while
going<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:53.620> decreasing<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> pace<00:04:54.920> a<00:04:54.950> little

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
going and decreasing the pace a little

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.980 
going and decreasing the pace a little
bit<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.550> just<00:04:55.580> going<00:04:55.850> for<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.150> walk<00:04:56.420> something

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
bit and just going for a walk something

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.600 
bit and just going for a walk something
like<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:57.350> but<00:04:57.560> spending<00:04:58.010> about<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.520> know

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
like that but spending about you know

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.490 
like that but spending about you know
just<00:04:58.640> depends<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.420> intensity<00:04:59.810> anywhere

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
just depends on the intensity anywhere

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.220 
just depends on the intensity anywhere
from<00:05:00.680> 15<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.610> maybe<00:05:02.180> 20<00:05:02.570> minutes<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.930> cooling

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.600 
from 15 to maybe 20 minutes of cooling
down<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.680> depends<00:05:03.980> on<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.130> intensity<00:05:04.460> of

down just depends on the intensity of

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.710 
down just depends on the intensity of
what<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.820> is<00:05:04.940> you're<00:05:05.090> doing<00:05:05.120> but<00:05:05.450> you<00:05:05.540> want<00:05:05.690> to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
what it is you're doing but you want to

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.930 
what it is you're doing but you want to
gradually<00:05:06.380> bring<00:05:06.500> that<00:05:06.680> cooldown<00:05:07.130> in<00:05:07.310> cool

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
gradually bring that cooldown in cool

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.780 
gradually bring that cooldown in cool
have<00:05:08.510> fun
