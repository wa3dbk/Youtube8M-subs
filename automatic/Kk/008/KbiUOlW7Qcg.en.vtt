or actually let's stealth rock I would

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.310 
or actually let's stealth rock I would
rather<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.949> almost<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.549> full<00:01:05.700> health

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
rather use almost are at full health

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.990 
rather use almost are at full health
we're<00:01:07.320> faster<00:01:07.799> than<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.280> while<00:01:08.520> wow<00:01:08.939> he

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we're faster than more while wow he

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.179 
we're faster than more while wow he
misses<00:01:09.390> play<00:01:09.570> rough<00:01:09.810> too<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.350> really

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
misses play rough too that's really

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
misses play rough too that's really
unlucky<00:01:11.510> let's<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:13.430> Seviper<00:01:15.170> actually

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
unlucky let's go into Seviper actually

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
unlucky let's go into Seviper actually
let's<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> rose<00:01:16.710> red<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.729> even<00:01:20.729> resisted

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
let's go on a rose red and even resisted

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960 
let's go on a rose red and even resisted
that<00:01:21.270> those<00:01:21.509> fifty<00:01:21.900> four<00:01:22.140> percent<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.820> get

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that those fifty four percent and we get

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.620 
that those fifty four percent and we get
us<00:01:24.090> attack<00:01:25.049> drop<00:01:25.320> play<00:01:25.619> rough<00:01:25.830> seems<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
us attack drop play rough seems like it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
us attack drop play rough seems like it
lowers<00:01:27.630> attack<00:01:27.960> every<00:01:28.320> single<00:01:28.619> time<00:01:31.220> let's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
lowers attack every single time let's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.300 
lowers attack every single time let's
see<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.549> hit<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> sweet<00:01:32.970> powder<00:01:33.210> nice

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
see if we can hit a sweet powder nice

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
see if we can hit a sweet powder nice
and<00:01:36.079> now<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.939> HP<00:01:39.360> fire<00:01:39.570> does

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and now we can see what HP fire does

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
and now we can see what HP fire does
it's<00:01:40.170> probably<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> too<00:01:41.340> much

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it's probably not going to do too much

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.139 
it's probably not going to do too much
but<00:01:42.299> oh<00:01:42.570> yeah<00:01:43.530> that's<00:01:43.860> an<00:01:43.950> easy<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.310> ação<00:01:44.610> he

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
but oh yeah that's an easy to ação he

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.389 
but oh yeah that's an easy to ação he
wakes<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.570> though<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.079> he's<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:46.860> fire<00:01:47.070> Fang

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
wakes up though and he's got fire Fang

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
wakes up though and he's got fire Fang
well<00:01:48.299> less<00:01:48.509> sucks<00:01:48.810> couldn't<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.500> stay

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
well less sucks couldn't just stay

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.060 
well less sucks couldn't just stay
asleep<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.250> turn<00:01:51.200> all<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
asleep for one turn all right well I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
asleep for one turn all right well I
guess<00:01:53.250> he<00:01:53.460> deserves<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> after<00:01:54.329> missing<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
guess he deserves that after missing a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
guess he deserves that after missing a
player<00:01:55.229> off<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> focus<00:01:56.009> blast<00:01:57.140> but<00:01:58.909> let's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
player off and a focus blast but let's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
player off and a focus blast but let's
see<00:02:00.149> we're<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> heat<00:02:01.170> wave<00:02:01.490> Scott

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
see we're gonna have to heat wave Scott

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
see we're gonna have to heat wave Scott
sucker<00:02:02.790> punch<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> heat<00:02:04.409> waves<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.799> take

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
sucker punch but heat waves gonna take

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.540 
sucker punch but heat waves gonna take
him<00:02:05.130> right<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:06.590> he<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.710> knows<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
him right out he now knows we have a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.830 
him right out he now knows we have a
heat<00:02:09.000> wave<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.360> pidgeot<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
heat wave on pidgeot so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.390 
heat wave on pidgeot so
if<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.470> need<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.769> in<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.890> future<00:02:13.099> that's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
if we need that in the future that's

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.449 
if we need that in the future that's
probably<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.060> too<00:02:14.269> useful<00:02:15.459> but

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
probably not going to be too useful but

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.570 
probably not going to be too useful but
I<00:02:16.489> kind<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.819> had<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:18.310> we've<00:02:19.310> got<00:02:19.340> an

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
I kind of had to do it we've got an

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.000 
I kind of had to do it we've got an
expert<00:02:20.060> build<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.629> thing<00:02:20.989> we<00:02:21.590> still<00:02:21.860> got

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
good he's gonna go into zapdos we don't

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.350 
good he's gonna go into zapdos we don't
have<00:02:31.129> much<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.489> wants<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> take<00:02:31.879> this<00:02:32.030> stuff

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
have much that wants to take this stuff

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.009 
have much that wants to take this stuff
but<00:02:33.230> let's<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.739> into<00:02:33.860> regigigas<00:02:38.019> yeah

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
but let's go into regigigas yeah

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.660 
but let's go into regigigas yeah
thunderbolts<00:02:39.530> not<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.010> much<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.549> we

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
thunderbolts not going to do much and we

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.729 
thunderbolts not going to do much and we
have<00:02:40.819> leftovers<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:44.260> let's<00:02:45.260> uh<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:48.560> could

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
have leftovers so let's uh we could

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.910 
have leftovers so let's uh we could
throw<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> substitute<00:02:49.849> oh<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:51.230> got<00:02:51.349> toxic

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
throw up a substitute oh it's got toxic

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.400 
throw up a substitute oh it's got toxic
SAP<00:02:52.579> doses<00:02:52.970> are<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.329> annoying<00:02:53.540> random<00:02:54.079> battles

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
SAP doses are so annoying random battles

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.170 
SAP doses are so annoying random battles
sometimes<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.579> have<00:02:55.849> stuff<00:02:56.060> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
sometimes you just don't have stuff to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.330 
sometimes you just don't have stuff to
handle<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.629> I<00:02:56.810> don't<00:02:57.379> know<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.099> have

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
handle them I don't know that I have

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.830 
handle them I don't know that I have
anything<00:02:58.579> that<00:02:58.879> can<00:02:58.910> do<00:02:59.120> more<00:02:59.390> than<00:02:59.510> fifty

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
anything that can do more than fifty

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.930 
anything that can do more than fifty
percent<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.379> zapdos<00:03:01.269> if<00:03:02.269> he<00:03:03.049> has<00:03:03.140> roost

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
percent of the zapdos if he has roost

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.330 
percent of the zapdos if he has roost
yeah<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.150> then<00:03:05.420> he<00:03:05.450> takes<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.079> easily<00:03:06.829> if

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
yeah and then he takes that easily if

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.789 
yeah and then he takes that easily if
this<00:03:08.269> thing<00:03:08.480> that's<00:03:08.629> roost<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.140> don't<00:03:09.500> think<00:03:09.709> I

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
this thing that's roost I don't think I

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:18.789 
this thing that's roost I don't think I
can<00:03:09.950> touch<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.739> see<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:16.069> happens<00:03:17.799> once

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
can touch it and see what happens once

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.550 
can touch it and see what happens once
slowstar<00:03:19.190> ends<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.239> will<00:03:20.389> be<00:03:20.840> able<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.079> do<00:03:21.230> more

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
slowstar ends we will be able to do more

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.819 
slowstar ends we will be able to do more
damage<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:23.989> imagine<00:03:24.470> he's<00:03:24.590> just<00:03:24.709> gonna

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
damage but I imagine he's just gonna

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.379 
damage but I imagine he's just gonna
solve<00:03:25.130> again<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:25.609> yeah<00:03:30.430> hmm<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.359> a

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
solve again here yeah hmm this is a

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.410 
solve again here yeah hmm this is a
problem<00:03:33.340> well<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.579> my<00:03:34.700> last<00:03:34.730> turn<00:03:35.299> I'm

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
problem well this is my last turn I'm

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.380 
problem well this is my last turn I'm
gonna<00:03:35.599> have<00:03:35.720> regigigas

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.680 

yeah<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.580> guess<00:03:45.580> we<00:03:45.730> find<00:03:45.970> out<00:03:46.180> here<00:03:46.450> if<00:03:46.569> this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
yeah so I guess we find out here if this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.690 
yeah so I guess we find out here if this
thing<00:03:46.930> has<00:03:47.110> roost<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.950> what<00:03:51.069> happens<00:03:51.430> he

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
thing has roost see what happens he

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.369 
thing has roost see what happens he
can't<00:03:51.940> toxic<00:03:52.420> this<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.349> helps<00:03:55.379> let's

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
can't toxic this so that helps let's

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.640 
can't toxic this so that helps let's
just<00:03:57.000> poison<00:03:58.000> jab<00:03:58.150> that's<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> attack<00:03:59.500> you've

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
just poison jab that's the attack you've

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.920 
just poison jab that's the attack you've
got<00:03:59.830> its<00:04:00.010> gonna<00:04:00.220> do<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.550> most<00:04:00.730> damage<00:04:00.930> this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
got its gonna do the most damage this

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.960 
got its gonna do the most damage this
thing<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> mixed<00:04:02.890> attacker<00:04:05.730> he's<00:04:06.730> going<00:04:06.910> to

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
thing is a mixed attacker he's going to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.330 
thing is a mixed attacker he's going to
go<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.150> its<00:04:07.269> saw<00:04:07.480> two<00:04:09.810> that's<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:11.019> 28<00:04:11.530> k<00:04:11.830> 0<00:04:13.019> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
go in its saw two that's a 28 k 0 and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.039 
go in its saw two that's a 28 k 0 and
this<00:04:15.340> one<00:04:16.560> probably<00:04:17.560> has<00:04:17.799> magic<00:04:18.459> bounce<00:04:19.049> we

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
this one probably has magic bounce we

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.960 
this one probably has magic bounce we
lived<00:04:20.380> through<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.070> kill<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.519> saw<00:04:21.729> too

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
lived through that and kill the saw too

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.629 
lived through that and kill the saw too
so<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.389> helps<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.780> lot<00:04:23.729> still<00:04:24.729> 3<00:04:25.120> vs<00:04:25.510> 3<00:04:26.639> he's

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
so that helps a lot still 3 vs 3 he's

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.950 
so that helps a lot still 3 vs 3 he's
probably<00:04:27.850> got<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.060> mock<00:04:28.330> punch<00:04:28.660> here<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:30.960> don't

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
probably got a mock punch here I don't

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.780 
probably got a mock punch here I don't
know<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.830> might<00:04:33.010> be<00:04:33.040> worth<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.610> let

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
know it might be worth it just to let

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.570 
know it might be worth it just to let
some<00:04:33.970> viper<00:04:34.180> die<00:04:34.600> though<00:04:35.250> yeah<00:04:36.250> I'm<00:04:36.430> just

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
some viper die though yeah I'm just

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.840 
some viper die though yeah I'm just
gonna<00:04:36.669> go<00:04:36.760> for<00:04:36.940> poison<00:04:37.389> jab<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.870> yeah<00:04:38.850> he's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
gonna go for poison jab and yeah he's

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.760 
gonna go for poison jab and yeah he's
life<00:04:40.180> orbed<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:42.360> don't<00:04:43.360> think<00:04:43.770> anything's

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
life orbed I don't think anything's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.629 
life orbed I don't think anything's
gonna<00:04:44.889> want<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.250> take<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.430> brave<00:04:46.240> bird

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
gonna want to take a brave bird

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.400 
gonna want to take a brave bird
especially<00:04:48.639> not<00:04:49.030> elder<00:04:49.389> and<00:04:49.660> he<00:04:49.990> left<00:04:50.260> it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
especially not elder and he left it

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.779 
especially not elder and he left it
in<00:04:50.560> that's<00:04:50.830> kind<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.760> an<00:04:51.880> interesting<00:04:51.970> choice

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
in that's kind of an interesting choice

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.690 
in that's kind of an interesting choice
if<00:04:54.789> zapdos<00:04:55.600> is<00:04:55.750> faster<00:04:56.139> than<00:04:56.169> pidgeotto<00:04:56.979> it's

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
if zapdos is faster than pidgeotto it's

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.640 
if zapdos is faster than pidgeotto it's
over<00:04:58.889> if<00:05:00.090> I'm<00:05:01.090> faster<00:05:01.539> brayford<00:05:02.050> might<00:05:02.289> kill

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
over if I'm faster brayford might kill

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.010 
over if I'm faster brayford might kill
though<00:05:02.889> oh<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:04.479> doesn't<00:05:04.750> uh<00:05:06.300> yeah<00:05:07.300> heatwave

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
though oh it doesn't uh yeah heatwave

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.020 
though oh it doesn't uh yeah heatwave
might<00:05:08.560> have<00:05:08.710> killed<00:05:09.210> but<00:05:10.210> not<00:05:10.900> sure<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:12.030> don't

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
might have killed but not sure I don't

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.240 
might have killed but not sure I don't
know<00:05:13.270> if<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.780> would<00:05:13.930> have<00:05:14.080> been<00:05:14.740> worth<00:05:15.010> it

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
know if that would have been worth it

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.029 
know if that would have been worth it
with<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.610> stab<00:05:15.910> damage<00:05:16.450> let's<00:05:17.440> just<00:05:17.530> ice<00:05:17.800> beam

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
with the stab damage let's just ice beam

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.400 
with the stab damage let's just ice beam
here<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:18.490> see<00:05:18.580> what<00:05:18.729> happens<00:05:19.260> he<00:05:20.260> can

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
here and see what happens he can
