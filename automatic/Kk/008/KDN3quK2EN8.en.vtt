00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530 

I'm<00:00:43.750> using<00:00:44.170> my<00:00:44.350> Sigma<00:00:44.710> f80<00:00:45.250> flat<00:00:45.430> kabuki<00:00:45.910> pop

I'm using my Sigma f80 flat kabuki pop

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.420

on<00:00:46.690> my<00:00:46.720> foundation<00:00:46.960> I'm<00:00:47.590> actually<00:00:47.800> using<00:00:48.129> a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430

on my foundation I'm actually using a
powder<00:00:48.700> foundation<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.570> this<00:00:49.989> is<00:00:50.140> from<00:00:50.290> Kiko

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.160 

therefore<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.000> brows<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.600> wanted<00:01:18.930> something

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
therefore my brows I wanted something

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.709

that<00:01:19.350> sound<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.130> day<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> opted<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
that sound all day so I opted for a

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.960 
that sound all day so I opted for a
powder<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.189> crushed<00:01:23.520> walnut

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

powder and this is just crushed walnut
from<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> natural<00:01:24.600> collection<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
from the natural collection and it's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:36.399 
from the natural collection and it's

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.050 

then<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> went<00:01:38.009> over<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.549> brow<00:01:38.729> gel

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
then I just went over with some brow gel

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
then I just went over with some brow gel
just<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.600> sure<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.079> browser's<00:01:40.500> stay

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
just to make sure that my browser's stay

just to make sure that my browser's stay
in<00:01:40.770> place<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.280> day<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> wanted<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> keep

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
in place all day so I wanted to keep

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.529 
in place all day so I wanted to keep

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
reason that I lined my eyes was so I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
quite tanned at the minute but I just

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.319

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and then to highlight I'm using this

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.259 
and then to highlight I'm using this
middle<00:03:28.799> color<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.160> my<00:03:29.280> sleep<00:03:29.549> palette<00:03:29.970> and

middle color for my sleep palette and
it's<00:03:30.629> quite<00:03:30.900> glittery<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.709> works<00:03:31.920> really

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it's quite glittery so it works really

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
it's quite glittery so it works really
well<00:03:32.519> as<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> highlight<00:03:33.090> color

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750
