00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.219

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.699

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.019
 motorola

 i simply 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.789
 gives us 13 options 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.789
 here fits well it is written I think china zte 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.949
 three are the options that gives us 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.609
 they do not give us the three options that two months other 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.329
 the last one that can show you 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.639

 and here gives us the speed of enke 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.049
 will try to exploit our devices 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 no need nilda as a type of severity 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.529
 this is the way I most found it for what 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.279
 look 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.279
 fairly good 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 You can not regret too 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.419
 they can decrease 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.870
 few all that way 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.830
 but well that is the second that will dictate the quabit and those that the pp 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.229
 can contradict and here very soon will also serve for the ipad serves 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.900

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.010

 stadium 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.690
 stay talk that is totally free and cocktail cysts that I tell you that gives us 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.300
 three options thirteen options for is what our device 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.749
 for example the finger up 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.159
 not everything is what it was 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.159
 or so to low 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.619
 or with two due of two a finger there are different options 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.419
 nesta 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.419
 i the last tweet is not recommended that this 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.970
 we remember the functions you choose from the option we choose 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.970
 because they are 13 and they are different 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.509
 things that we can select and if we do not remember then 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.979
 such potter lemos that puts our device before 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.979
 seismus to deactivate is to install the click and 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.259
 is what our devices good supposed about this video 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.639
 before these three, your ex expected it to be useful 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.250
 the least that deserves to comment 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.800
