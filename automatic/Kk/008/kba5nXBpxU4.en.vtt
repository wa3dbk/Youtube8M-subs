00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.010
 There were 1000 people 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.100
 Develop once 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.609
 It is a compromised form 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 I want to distribute the challenger 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.019
 It is likely to be a battle of peace and human rights 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.230
 It started in the ground 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 How to get motivated from there 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 For the first time in this situation 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.050
 It looks like this 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.060
 Uninhabited island rose 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 Power has been on since last month 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 Set count is 1318 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 The place where I wanted to take another one went with this momentum 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 It started in the ground 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 In addition 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 The government seized 13 people 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.160
 I do not give out here Winter birds 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 Same 3 This has not been reached 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.439
 On the other hand 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.439
 There were 17 injured people 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.159
 How was i now 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.370
 Feeling strong but 4 goals in the last 2 games
