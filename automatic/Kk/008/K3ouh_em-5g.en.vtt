00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.090
 I'm Aleksei Chernushenko today 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.010
 let's talk about building a bath for 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.150
 In order for the bath to use it you need 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.980
 first build process is not fast 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.109
 quite complex scrupulous consisting 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.400
 from the mass of nuances 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.010
 Sorry in one program to answer 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.410
 all current issues like what why of 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.780
 which is completely impossible and we are today 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.670
 let's touch on the main issues before 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.590
 total ecological baths 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.899
 After all, you need to build not just some 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.149
 a structure in which there is some kind of stove 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.160
 and gives heat to build 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.700
 you need the very bath in which we will 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.310
 receive 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.050
 and pleasure and health and help us 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.620
 answer these most relevant 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.559
 questions 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.600
 we are a good friend Andrei kurashev in 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.450
 visit at which we are today 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 good day he and in our previous 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.050
 programs we are already in short with you 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 discussed all sorts of questions 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.809
 construction baths and with several 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.340
 baths will introduce in detail we talked about 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.689
 that the best baths of course 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.159
 obtained from wood regardless 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.720
 material used by you 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 whether it be plank on and log 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.290
 round log 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.420
 the most frequent question that us 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.850
 ask our viewers of england this then 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.800
 what does a bath need to warm a bath 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.050
 must keep you warm for 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.790
 the moon and to what then in this case 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.340
 it is necessary to warm from because with that now climb 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.020
 online or talk to our 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.150
 great builders who trade 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
 of all sorts of things in the construction markets 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.500
 after all, will they be offered a damn? 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.510
 asked a question starting from foam 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.450
 and minvaty ending all than just 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.200
 it is possible but the absurdity of the situation is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.030
 the fact that just unfortunately for nothing 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.130
 practically what is sold on ours 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.740
 building markets bath warm 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.350
 minutes that is it is possible to warm with 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.540
 technical standpoint maintained heat 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.210
 warmly persist to but bath 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.980
 will cease to be pathological 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.800
 logically clean and instead of bath 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.110
 procedures improve but we get 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.140
 just and and people in no way be 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.130
 use for insulating baths no 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 polystyrene is not ordinary styrofoam so 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.740
 called white packaging qatar everywhere 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.600
 sold but of course after 60 degrees 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.460
 the dialogue begins as choose yes y 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.160
 plastics 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.380
 the destruction of materials is very strong 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.400
 after 60 degrees not extrusion 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.350
 polystyrene nor minvatami because 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.390
 mineral wool used phenols 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.390
 but you also start to stand out if 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.480
 mingott bisphenol auto they will then 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.230
 pour through the inevitable holes from 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.160
 some nails even if you isolate 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.640
 sauna room 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.490
 under 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.830
 this is a crumple anyway punctures 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.319
 from nails and other things that is determined 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.630
 micro tanks warm glass the new 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.120
 despite the fact that the manufacturer 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.930
 minted wars are supposedly produced 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.420
 already covered with foil for sauna 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.800
 but nevertheless it is still impossible 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.380
 consider environmentally correct 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.080
 the only thing you can warm the bath as 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.510
 nor strange it sounds in general warriors 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.520
 for example, as a natural gift of nature 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.470
 it is natural to warm it yourself smell and 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 just does not threaten him with such a display tunic 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.370
 how about a little feet temperature not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.610
 sold in construction markets with us 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 there may be some kind of cork but 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.030
 cork manufacturing 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.070
 different i'm sure to use too 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.300
 festering again all glue some 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910
 phenolic components 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.420
 that is, despite the apparent 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.450
 variety of materials in general except 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.580
 felt and on where and foil and foil 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 need it not so much need for insulation 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.660
 how much foil is needed 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.880
 for the vapor barrier of the fact that the wolf is very 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.230
 very hygroscopic and baths usually 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.060
 are done when 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.430
 but when the ports add water there 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.380
 the humidity is very high for 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.510
 so that the moisture is not absorbed by the mall just 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.030
 use foil 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.989
 no purpose say foil possesses 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.790
 heat reflective cap as well but 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.950
 if we have it open 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.110
 space the thing is open 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.060
 foil yourself or in the bath no one 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.460
 leaves they sew up with boards like 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.930
 the rule of the race she goes under the batten a 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.630
 there about any 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.169
 it has a radiant heat reflecting effect already 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.330
 only does not go ie foil is used 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.300
 just for vapor barrier i wouldn't 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.669
 advised use for vapor barrier 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.440
 again plastic film which 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.800
 we sell tires for the very reasons 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.409
 what it is plastic one more time 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.150
 I would like to say that when we 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.090
 We are an example if we again 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.430
 talking about a free-standing bath 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.280
 out of the log when we have open 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.199
 the log inside then she possesses such 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.599
 wonderful property how smooths 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.419
 us temperature and water hammer which 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.810
 happen so it's kind of such 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.479
 damper because if we have a room 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.629
 it will be well insulated for example Kiev 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.150
 waterproofed then these steam rooms 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.969
 procedures they will be very strong 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.250
 strike here you threw a sharp blow to 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.669
 cutting hitting tour on you like bar bad 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.159
 humidity kick and logs separately 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.650
 standing log bathhouse wooden 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.150
 here they are 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.949
 hydraulic temperature humid 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.379
 punch and very smooth good to eat 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.900
 for the body themselves take it 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.729
 more gentle and correct with 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.830
 environmental point of view process 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.569
 procedure here we are now with you 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.180
 touched just one moment 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.430
 insulation of the bath and so if you build 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.620
 a separate bathhouse except 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.029
 quality ok pro k on pachino 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.680
 you rubbo using natural 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:03.370
 materials form moss or lina or hemp 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.650
 or felt no other 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.680
 heat insulators you do not need if 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.409
 you build a bathhouse into your house the most 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.930
 good thermal insulation and vapor barrier 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:19.300
 there will be some complex consisting of 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.300
 metal foil and felt by
