 broth in my back 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 and then I'm going to mix so ideally 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.100
 it would be so leave all night 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 our chicken legs to marinate in the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 spices but here we will do it we will 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.729
 cook right now actually 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.940
 huh because we do not have the time to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:55.259
 so let husband d then a little bit 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.490
 of oil in the pan by the passion of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.920
 chicken you will be able to also the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.610
 replace with calf the bad in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.050
 perimeter of the new beef legally 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.289
 it gets married practically and all 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.009
 meat 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.780
 we can make it go fish if 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.110
 so the mackerel pastilla I 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.970
 tried it was not bad 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.970
 so here I put my chicken legs 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.720
 So this is it 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.300
 chicken legs are golden brown 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.480
 watch in front of reims and on a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.480
 plate 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.170
 I'm going to put my onions to get drunk 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.170
 a little bit 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.080
 jean-claude onions with square feet 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.320
 see m I could 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.480
 me 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.590
 and our best 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.830
 so now we're going to bake your 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:45.460
 stove so in the oven for 45 minutes to 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.460
 180 our chicken cooked it 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.790
 we're going to take it out of the oven 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.110
 all the fragrances of konami spices to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.670
 inside so we'll leave it 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:06.099
 cool for an hour so there I 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.099
 go my was so all my chicken 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.660
 I also had that onions 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.169
 so we'll grilled noah world at 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.139
 microwave 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.910
 it takes about one minute and thirty one 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.910
 treat and parakou of 30 seconds 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.599
 so we a world for well grilled so 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.759
 in the microwave 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.680
 so the trick for mounting the 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.289
 pastilles so these are lozenges to 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 without sugar then we will put a small 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.500
 little slivered almonds on my TV 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240
 should then I put back on top 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.270
 easy made of bricks I had 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.370
 the idea of going olive oil and I 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.650
 will put on top 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:04.550
 it makes me bricks that I also 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:11.690
 him and then I'll put a 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.759
 little pile of chicken that I filocher and 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.770
 we will go to looting so we 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:21.080
 start by folding the half bricks and 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.270
 we end up the band so why do I 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.259
 put it on a plate simply 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.699
 to be able to return it so the 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.699
 realize our first pastilla 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.620
 So here I will still make you a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.470
 can use butter in if you 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.470
 want there I put the indes 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.900
 so I give half a sheet of 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:58.380
 brig 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:06:03.230
 I put olive oil window vote 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.230
 about 3 tablespoons of chicken 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.560
 a first fold and after I do second 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.420
 price with the big brick sheet 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.700
 here I go back it's true I'm going 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.960
 put all this on the plates 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.960
 I will continue so 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.030
 so I finished climbing but bastia 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.270
 I spend a last brushstroke by 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.030
 on it and we go fuckers 5 to 10 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:39.150
 minutes to hot oven that is to say 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:41.960
 180 degrees to watch of course do not 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.960
 leak-free pastilla 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.110
 so we get a very beautiful 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.330
 coloring 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.320
 so I'm going to let them cool 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.320
 before setting on a plate 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.810
 we will go to dressage then 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.790
 I took a plate 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.060
 I sprinkled with cinnamon powder 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.650
 there I put down my pastilla and there I 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.900
 mixed so loved flaked almonds 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:19.150
 with a little bit of icing sugar 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.360
 quick pastilla to make is easy to 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.370
