00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 and there, guys, beauty rafael here all 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 People you here replay of me fasp 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.750
 drivers and face and follow plate do not want 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 talk a little about what you think of the game 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 Because he's a guy, I've always been a fan of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.769
 need for speed series but the last one 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.949
 of them was to ask that I really played 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 I finished very willingly 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.720
 uniform speed your friend or carbon 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 He came later if I 'm not mistaken. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 a year in force I 'm not mistaken 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.110
 was fashion was cool we do where 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.450
 was great of 2 shows human understands and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 nor are we going to ask for coal are deceived 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 order and that I'm a big fan of the series 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.980
 because I've always liked the way that I 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 was a guest object is not a game that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.710
 if it entered a very real way of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.390
 driving this is a way of running the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.399
 I play every way over here that mode 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 which I find most fun car game 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 so it's the kind of game going to play 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.289
 not that I do not like to play 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.579
 simulators 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.199
 even because there are almost as many 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.689
 pc followers but I was very fond of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.900
 play some old games as great 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.760
 tourism and such but beauty me for speed 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
 it was a little we played 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.930
 cup I found it very interesting because 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 it brings something that kinda joins that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 game called bournout along with exit 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.030
 of a thorn where you can do 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 races and such 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.640
 in this blog you can choose to play 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 with the police rodrigo team or the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 team of guys running in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 corridors her so I found a lot 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.439
 interesting you have two options you can 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.409
 be the last 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.540
 the little face you can be the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.090
 people who go through gaps in the streets and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.829
 it is an interesting thing to give 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.240
 you play in this world's multiplayer and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.860
 I think this business playing 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 So multiplayer also brings something well 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.259
 interesting of kind a guy who goes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.299
 Try to end your race to it 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.549
 as he very much remembers the burnout game 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.990
 and dude ignores the fact he's driving 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.030
 too bad because I was driving 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.939
 and of course do much time elapsed 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the keyboard then it's kind of strange 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.869
 play for me but I was trying 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.560
 set the keys people look good 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.629
 for me to play 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.330
 so this way the guy playing type 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.720
 you play as a police officer or as 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 runner same guy that does 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.260
 the handles are you have that option you 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.210
 The staff is making the 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.530
 running or you do the thing that 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.480
 You have to be careful now that you are 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.860
 messing up and this has a way 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 multiplayer so I found it well 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.880
 interesting because out of nowhere appeared 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 people playing on the same map as me 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.260
 I was playing and I could try 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 mess them up like running against them 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.980
 If I had you I would be a guy who 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.540
 practice races but how are you playing 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.540
 Because of the police, you're going to see me. 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.730
 I think it's interesting to see this. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.740
 I did not try and I did not make a run. 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.730
 against anyone the screen I do not have a 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.560
 The car that was in the key is very 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.500
 cool is kind of hauling on the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.540
 middle of the race but it was very interesting 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.920
 to see how the game works like that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.620
 face in front has a name that is a 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.840
 another person who is playing then man is 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.520
 I am very very very same show to see 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.190
 There's even the strong side you can 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.709
 recommend some carriers and I 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.800
 was trying to knock this guy out. 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.050
 had understood very well how to pack 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.730
 how to jump and how to do it for you guys 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.040
 that the car tried yesterday two 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.260
 that the mpe in another business there 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.000
 that I also very well what he does 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.440
 so I 'm still learning to play 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.870
 the game played a little bit just to see 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.060
 what it was like and I saw it really 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.519
 something interesting to play what 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.140
 You have to be there to practice how to beat. 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.060
 the practical cases manage to overthrow 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.380
 they have the right powers of the car when 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.959
 the old power are the skills that 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.700
 You have with mpe so I notice that there 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.350
 I have not tried it that way but it does not 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.269
 I can continue the persecution because I 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.800
 I saw that the place was in the last because 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.739
 besides driving is driving badly in the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.360
 game I simply is not was 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.950
 understanding very well what I had to 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.920
 do since this was a little uncle 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.450
 my first moments of game though 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.340
 It would be really cool if you had school. 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.320
 because it's there in the last hours it looks 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.940
 flood and if she really was 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.440
 in the last hours but I thought I 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.720
 also the last, I will not go 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.370
 I even risk it because I do not know what happens 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.980
 my car explodes 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.440
 then something else that will take the following 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.170
 I 'll tell you, it 's some more. 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.850
 games because this game and that was I want 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.930
 tell you not only if someone did I 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.489
 I'll talk a little more about some 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.690
 things I saw in the game but I want to 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.370
 Show talk to you a little bit 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.410
 about my experience with cars in 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.950
 real life what kind of experience I 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.090
 I had to drive over the 134 calcium 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.590
 car I have now that has a lot 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.400
 thing for you a driver's license 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.660
 but went outside 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.009
 It's because it has a very long history. 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
 about my driver's license that 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.479
 It was kind of annoying to do so I'm going 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.370
 explain to you there I will tell the 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.169
 your next videos where I 'm at 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.490
 you need for speed anger 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.320
 so that's it I hope you have 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.840
 liked it like that force 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.840
 of that on the faces and even more
