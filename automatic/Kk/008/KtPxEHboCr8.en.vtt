00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.839
 Welcome from Amsterdam where we join 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.540
 panasonics with the a500 one of the first 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.700
 four k video recorder here with you 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.650
 can take 30 frames to lower 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.389
 can be recorded just like 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.119
 concept so unfortunately i can help you now 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.800
 make no image at all because the current 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.720
 but the beautiful thing is that they are 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.599
 Here is a nice long cable 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.920
 then actually have the objective 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.420
 So to say where the microphone too 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.189
 you can just integrate here 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.810
 the module has been stuck in the pocket 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.230
 corresponding micro sd card is in it 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.850
 Of course, the power supply operation 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.560
 as always, it is also very easy 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.060
 wlan operator so you can yours 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.160
 smartphone and similar use around as 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.840
 display the image or simply here 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.190
 and turn off and with the red button 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.900
 Of course, the video does not start now 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.780
 only in this nice orange what 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.520
 it stands out also here accordingly 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.990
 is silver to choose from 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.940
 then you can do this here 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.580
 evening turn on or then accordingly 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.920
 your head on the camera or you 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.570
 can become a red cat so to speak here 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.600
 At the end there make because of the microphone 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.920
 By the way, down here can of course 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.230
 be protected against the wind 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.570
 two players parachuting or 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.250
 here at 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.050
 a few meadows demonstrated here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.640
 Just such a shoulder is rap 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.350
 also possible or an exciting device 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.510
 I'm down in it and the camera 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.040
 relatively high up or out of the backpack 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.690
 fell out with a beautiful one 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.729
 Protected cable, so to speak everyone 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.640
 appropriately installed here in his 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.940
 bags pure accordingly also the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.680
 possibility then quite simply 4k videos 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.630
 take with coals adapter to 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.160
 look at it from the near because 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.690
 I do not really have you yet 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.220
 shown like that, for example, in loud 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.930
 here in spa with nfc very easy 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.130
 usable 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.470
 here is his full hd on it but 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.710
 in fact we can do a lot here too 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.330
 buy if you like the whole 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 undergo and push on the side 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.229
 then it works and then we see 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.700
 here the micro usb port and the micro sd 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.800
 card slot so charge here and then 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.810
 we can jump the cards too 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.890
 but swap and the beautiful at the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.450
 Of course, history is that too 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.500
 I think it's waterproof 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.580
 so here's the beautiful everywhere 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.080
 of course, beautifully built waterproof means 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.929
 but mostly not necessarily 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.430
 for salt water use then as well 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.269
 gumming broken but I would have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.730

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.470
