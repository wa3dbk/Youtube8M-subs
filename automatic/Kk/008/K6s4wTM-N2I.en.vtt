uploading a video of a new map that I
made<00:00:06.750> helm's<00:00:07.230> deep<00:00:07.290> remade<00:00:08.099> it's<00:00:08.760> remade

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179

it's been a while and that was when ever
i<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:14.460> started<00:00:14.700> forging<00:00:14.969> pretty<00:00:15.330> much<00:00:15.509> but

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
i first started forging pretty much but

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.849 
i first started forging pretty much but
yeah<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> beginning<00:00:18.449> go<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.170> kind<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
yeah in the beginning go here kind of

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.120

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
like a loud boom and that's whenever the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.509 
like a loud boom and that's whenever the
wall<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.180> destroyed<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.949> gonna<00:00:26.070> let

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
wall got destroyed but I'm not gonna let

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
wall got destroyed but I'm not gonna let
you<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> map<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.900> yet<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.109> i'm

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
you see the map just in yet because i'm

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
you see the map just in yet because i'm
going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> show<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> where<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.820> attacker

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to show you where the the attacker

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.740 
going to show you where the the attacker
spun<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> Guardians<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.570> listen<00:00:33.570> for

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
spun out in the Guardians but listen for

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.319 
spun out in the Guardians but listen for
the<00:00:33.989> list<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> fusion<00:00:35.340> coils<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the list for the fusion coils in and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.290 
the list for the fusion coils in and
then<00:00:36.510> i'll<00:00:36.600> show<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> around<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> map<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:38.670> did

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
then i'll show you around the map I did

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
then i'll show you around the map I did
run<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> money<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.770> keep<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.370> that's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
run out of money on the keep and that's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.930 
run out of money on the keep and that's
why<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.510> good<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
why it's not as good as it can be and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.069 
why it's not as good as it can be and
that's<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.480> only<00:00:45.539> thing<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that's probably the only thing that I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
that's probably the only thing that I
regret<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.520> tower<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
regret and also the tower is in a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
regret and also the tower is in a
different<00:00:49.260> place<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.160> recorded<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
different place now like I recorded this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
different place now like I recorded this
before<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.059> moved<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.590> letting<00:00:52.739> you

totally went off on me saying that my
last<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.500> looked<00:01:10.920> nothing<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> i<00:01:11.909> do

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
last one looked nothing like it and i do

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
last one looked nothing like it and i do
agree<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.420> him<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.580> just<00:01:14.580> before<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.060> start

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
agree with him but just before you start

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.030 
agree with him but just before you start
complaining<00:01:15.540> again<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.320> didn't<00:01:16.560> steal<00:01:16.710> any<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
complaining again I didn't steal any of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
complaining again I didn't steal any of
your<00:01:17.970> ideas<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.570> only<00:01:18.689> thing<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> still<00:01:19.200> was

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
your ideas the only thing I still was

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
your ideas the only thing I still was
probably<00:01:19.619> location<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:21.060> anyways<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
probably location but anyways the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.429 
probably location but anyways the
Wraiths<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.310> catapults<00:01:24.110> it's<00:01:25.110> actually

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
Wraiths are like catapults it's actually

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.420 
Wraiths are like catapults it's actually
really<00:01:25.560> hard<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.220> kills<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:28.430> I've

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
really hard to get some kills but i I've

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.499 
really hard to get some kills but i I've
never<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:29.970> used<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.180> i<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.390> really

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
never really used them i don't really

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.480 
never really used them i don't really
know<00:01:30.600> anybody<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> would<00:01:31.290> normally<00:01:32.220> use

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
know anybody that would normally use

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
know anybody that would normally use
them<00:01:32.670> finish<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:34.229> you're

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
them finish this there because you're

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.140 
them finish this there because you're
really<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> cool<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
really not going to get it cool and it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
really not going to get it cool and it
pretty<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.170> hard<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.680> that's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
pretty much it's pretty hard and that's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.719 
pretty much it's pretty hard and that's
because<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.170> hard<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> aim<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.460> two

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
because for one it's hard to aim for two

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
because for one it's hard to aim for two
they<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.180> plenty<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> move<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
they have plenty of time to move out of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.010 
they have plenty of time to move out of
the<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.360> hardly<00:01:45.659> any<00:01:45.780> point

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the way so it's really hardly any point

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
the way so it's really hardly any point
but<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.380> cool<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> add<00:01:46.909> but<00:01:47.909> here's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but it's just cool to add but here's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.350 
but it's just cool to add but here's
helm's<00:01:48.899> deep<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> wall<00:01:50.009> rd<00:01:50.490> exploded

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
helm's deep with the wall rd exploded

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
helm's deep with the wall rd exploded
there's<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> big<00:01:52.530> hole<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.619> run<00:01:56.460> on

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there's a big hole and so just run on

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.240 
there's a big hole and so just run on
through<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.540> talk<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> through

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
through it for you and talk you through

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780 
through it for you and talk you through
the<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.469> bridge<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the the the bridge going up to the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
the the the bridge going up to the
keypad<00:02:03.180> actually<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
keypad actually it was one of the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
keypad actually it was one of the
hardest<00:02:04.619> things<00:02:05.040> i<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.820> don't<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.149> why

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
hardest things i really don't know why

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.730 
hardest things i really don't know why
because<00:02:06.750> I've<00:02:06.899> done<00:02:07.079> things<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.560> harder

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
because I've done things a lot harder

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
because I've done things a lot harder
but<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.270> actually<00:02:09.360> really

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
but it's just because I actually really

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.260 
but it's just because I actually really
pretty<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> bank<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> that's<00:02:11.160> why

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
pretty like a bank in it and that's why

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.750 
pretty like a bank in it and that's why
it<00:02:12.390> hard<00:02:12.570> because<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.810> had<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.990> line<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.170> out<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it hard because I had to line it out the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.370 
it hard because I had to line it out the
teleporters<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.750> hold<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.020> pallets

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380

with the crabby tower back there that's

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.949 
with the crabby tower back there that's
again<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.580> there<00:03:32.790> anymore<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.240> moved<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.780> over

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
again not there anymore I moved it over

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.540 
again not there anymore I moved it over
where<00:03:34.860> they<00:03:34.950> attack<00:03:35.220> us<00:03:35.250> while<00:03:35.550> I'm<00:03:36.350> and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
really this in take very long to make I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.910 
really this in take very long to make I
thought<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.700> would<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.290> even<00:03:43.290> with<00:03:43.440> spending

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
thought it would but even with spending

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770 
thought it would but even with spending
a<00:03:44.070> little<00:03:44.280> bit<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.550> my<00:03:44.670> time<00:03:44.880> into<00:03:45.270> it<00:03:45.300> it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
a little bit of my time into it it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.080 
a little bit of my time into it it
didn't<00:03:46.050> take<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.170> long<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:46.760> because<00:03:47.760> i

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
didn't take that long because because i

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.240 
didn't take that long because because i
don't<00:03:48.240> have<00:03:48.360> xbox<00:03:48.810> live<00:03:48.990> right<00:03:49.200> now<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.680> i<00:03:49.890> had
