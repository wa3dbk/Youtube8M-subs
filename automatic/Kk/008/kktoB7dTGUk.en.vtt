00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello good to all synovium and we're 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 today here again in the fifa 14 and today I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 I bring the video of the ultimate that you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.110
 I had promised that it is my second team 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.580
 the second guy that I created and good since 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.740
 you know, I'm going to start by porting 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.790
 tell all my players that I have more 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790
 or less what it seems to me that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.970
 what they are and how they play just as good as 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.530
 You see I have six thousand coins but good 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.550
 they are not the same as another video and 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.280
 judged and promoted to the fifth division 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.350
 cattle had about 15 military but good 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.180
 sturridge tab but I will only do more 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.420
 ahead of him and well let's start 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980
 by the goalkeeper who is worm of the swansea 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 which is pretty good to me I like 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.329
 they had a lot to 113 and the cards that 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.120
 also because it has quite stretched 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.680
 reflex position that is is is very 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.010
 good for me and for my understanding is very 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.870
 good because one of those that is based 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.180
 has enough reflections and fabrics to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.180
 pretty good so I like it a lot 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.520
 then I have defenses here to smiling 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.759
 of Manchester that has 76 of pace and 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.679
 80 defense 75 head is pretty 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.130
 good you have 78 in general because 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:18.039
 the repeated for example has 28 that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.050
 must hit the ground like vidal yesterday but 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.700
 well I like it pretty much then I have here 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.580
 to my friend kabul who had him in 13 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.160
 of the French tottenham has 78 rhythm 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 and 80 defense 83 head to me I 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.110
 It looks very good from gs to 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.300
 to have it on the computer is pretty 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.600
 fast and also has a lot of defense and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.000
 a lot of head then I have chi chi here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 lites this one that already has 82 rhythm and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.210
 has less defense - head but good 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 with the other two who have more defense 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.050
 because in the countries the length is how 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.690
 it's so fast because it's pretty 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.700
 pretty well it 's pretty good that the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.640
 two others so I really like 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.480
 quite then I have to of mcd I have to 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.720
 sandro I have the opposite that they had the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.610
 fifa 13 I have less fast people I have 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 for example this 73 of pace but has 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.720
 a lot of defense and walks makes quite 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.100
 well as well as it is mcd because neither 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.709
 have to run so much is in the center 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.170
 more than anything and I like it a lot later 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.140
 I have here your choice and your forehead that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.730
 has 74 of rhythm 74 defense stories 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.860
 I also like it a lot 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 pretty good at this it gets a little 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.070
 pass but for me to pass I like 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 pretty to the triangle they make good passes 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.360
 and the truth is that we like it a lot and 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 then I have the lead here and it starts 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.380
 an emmy and well this team is in 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 construction there are players who do not 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.550
 change that until I have many 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
 coins but for example the m 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.390
 I just are the next ones that I'm going to 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.250
 change for example here would be a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.660
 round of metro emt or nasri or something like that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.260
 but well little by little I think that the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.740
 mercedes would i change you an active you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.890
 by ramÃ­rez but that gradually that you 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.230
 nothing I have to jarvis 87 rhythm 78 of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.830
 dribble that dribbling does not bargain anything but 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.090
 spend 75 I think it has a lot more 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.370
 centers fairly well then the cuts 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.960
 I make them with him and he's pretty good at it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 what is a meme and what is affordable for 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.450
 who has many coins is pretty 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.670
 good 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.920
 after the winner I have the fabia that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.200
 like it very much has very good numbers 187 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.970
 of rhythm 84 and dribble can bargain 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.340
 fine and then when you're already in front of 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.980
 the winning goal even if you do not have 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.570
 a lot of shot has 73 of the keys to me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.800
 I really like mc or have lost 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.960
 win but I like a lot is very 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.900
 affordable and I would sign it if I were 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.120
 starting as I have done then I have here 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.790
 nm md that the file another day look is already 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.710
 which has 88 85 pace regatta 75's 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.870
 379 looks like a player 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.090
 quite complete is not gold but to me 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
 I really like that he runs a lot and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.260
 It can roll well, I'm going to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.600
 overtaking jazz is that I love this 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.430
 front I love I have here this 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.040
 disk just signed it had the fifa 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.050
 13 together with ben but now he was 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.660
 rich here the sniper file or 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.760
 sale rhythm 83 dribble shot 77 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.650
 70 head is a mole above is very 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.840
 corpulent 90 of pace is a forward 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 from the berklee pretty good that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.750
 better than they have to berkeley with this 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.190
 already omen and already left this I had it is a 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.710
 player that if he had more rhythm would be 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.900
 the key whore has 83 of rhythm 83 of 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.880
 has 78 dribbles you have and where 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.640
 tires is that the slave all do the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.640
 awesome shots is that I love 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.070
 I love it if I had 80 dribble and 90 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.900
 of ring is that it would be the mole nothing else what 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.330
 bad is that it is very short and very very 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.430
 small then it is also easy body 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.410
 and barrier is cracked but good 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.200
 I have on the right that the band that does not 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.100
 I use a lot and the truth is that I 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.900
 complements quite well 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.020
 the Asturian still used 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.910
 extended now to the fifth division as well 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.120
 that nothing now I'm going to save for a 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.520
 emmy I'm thinking about django the one on 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.370
 chelsea the south is how it is pronounced 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.680
 and that is a mole s 20,000 coins or so 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.449
 There is the only thing to sign the steel and and 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.949
 little by little I will be doing the team and 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.360
 nothing of entrador see that I have here one 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.030
 of the simple berklee because I have 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.970
 mostly English or French 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.250
 that I have two then I record and total 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.400
 go the same thing so nothing this is my 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.990
 team from now on or on 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.729
 and last matches as you go 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.070
 advancing the leagues and such and nothing and 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.590
 you know give favorite likes subscribe 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.419
 and see you in the next video video 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.169
 that I anticipate that it is one of the call of 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.669
 duty in competitive league that I like 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.910

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.770
 exciting and nothing you'll see so 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.770
 nothing see you until the next
