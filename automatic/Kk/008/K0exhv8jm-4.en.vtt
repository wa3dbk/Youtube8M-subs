00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.340
 today welcome this is benchmark 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.930
 dotcom hardware and in today's video 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.150
 we will see the unbox and we will know more 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.889
 details of one of the ssd that will happen 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.530
 by our testing software during 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.540
 the next days 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.850
 in this video we are going to focus on the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.080
 sunday in its version of 128 gigas such and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.400
 as we anticipated in the video 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.260
 introductory past 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 sandy so you do not know the brand is a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.350
 economic ssd that has found a hole 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 in the market with its prices 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.040
 competitive ones which among others 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.239
 gets totally involved in the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.160
 process of manufacturing them 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.190
 auto suffices doing without interacting 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 with third marks another of the points 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 of its low cost is the housing being 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.080
 this one plastic against the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 efficiency of dissipation that their 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.170
 competitors that are mostly 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.059
 ride that alcasa from the action of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 aluminum offering up to 10 degrees 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 less temperature versus the sandisk 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.400
 with its plastic housing in the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 previous we have done before the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.090
 tests 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 and as we have seen in this brief a box 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 sundis does not incorporate any added in its 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.260
 product only the manual and the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 own ssd talking about andrÃ©s products 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 in its version of 64 and 128 gigas the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.920
 that we have here in this preview 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.710
 is mounted with memories ml ce that you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 they confer a speed of up to 475 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 megas according to manufacturer 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.659
 at the size level it is about 7 mm more or 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.280
 less than about 100 x 70 and as 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.289
 we have commented previously with a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.289
 completely plastic housing 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.549
 and so far this short preview of 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.229
 sandy if the ssd that we have chosen to 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.210
 the tests under our software is 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.430
 the slider if you want to know more about 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 these tests or the rest of those venues 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.290
 we leave you here some related videos 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.520
 about these same and remember us 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.140
