00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
on when I go to sleep and when I wake up

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.780 
on when I go to sleep and when I wake up
I<00:02:25.600> don't<00:02:26.600> know<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.050> makes<00:02:27.080> much<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.280> feel

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
I don't know if that makes much I feel

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.580 
I don't know if that makes much I feel
like<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> does<00:02:29.330> make<00:02:29.540> much<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.170> difference

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
like it does make much of a difference

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.410
