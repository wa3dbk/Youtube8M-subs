00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.680 
were so close in age we just thought
this<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.640> gonna<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:06.029> crazy<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.569> know<00:00:06.660> you're

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690

gonna<00:00:06.899> be<00:00:06.990> playing<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.470> mother<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.730> worked

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
gonna be playing my mother but it worked

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.629 
gonna be playing my mother but it worked
out<00:00:09.150> quite<00:00:09.809> nicely<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.429> just

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
out quite nicely and and I think it just

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.789 
out quite nicely and and I think it just
became<00:00:11.820> such<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> natural<00:00:12.929> relationship

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799

between the two of us I think if there's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.510 
between the two of us I think if there's
a<00:00:15.900> lot<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.529> element<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> living<00:00:17.310> through
