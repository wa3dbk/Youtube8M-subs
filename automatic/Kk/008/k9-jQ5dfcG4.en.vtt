looking at this right here I can tell

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
looking at this right here I can tell
that<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.649> nose<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that the nose is off it's much more of a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.360 
that the nose is off it's much more of a
light<00:00:55.530> gentle<00:00:55.860> curve<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.149> their

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
light gentle curve going into their

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.799 
light gentle curve going into their
fuselage<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:01:00.059> different

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
fuselage is a little different

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.619 
fuselage is a little different
canopy<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.219> too<00:01:02.520> high<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
canopy so it's a little too high and so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.230 
canopy so it's a little too high and so
on<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.110> forth<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> those<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.939> pretty

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on and so forth and those are pretty

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.640 
on and so forth and those are pretty
much<00:01:06.479> expected<00:01:08.659> for<00:01:09.659> me<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.930> least<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650

build<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.450> some<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> area<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:30.480> looks

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
build up some of the area there it looks

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860 
build up some of the area there it looks
like<00:02:30.750> there's<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> gold<00:02:32.239> right<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.450> here

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
like there's a bit of gold right up here

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.410 
like there's a bit of gold right up here
and<00:02:34.110> along<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> edge<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> wing<00:02:35.549> again<00:02:35.910> but

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and along the edge of the wing again but

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.460 
and along the edge of the wing again but
none<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.920> guy<00:02:42.260> looking<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
none here on this guy looking at the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.350 
none here on this guy looking at the
back<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.370> pretty<00:02:44.640> much<00:02:44.849> phoned<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
back they pretty much phoned the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.530 
back they pretty much phoned the
weathering<00:02:45.780> job<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.610> there's<00:02:47.610> no<00:02:48.090> work<00:02:48.330> or

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
weathering job in there's no work or

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.320 
weathering job in there's no work or
detail<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.200> whatsoever<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:51.090> can't

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
detail on that whatsoever and I can't

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.059 
detail on that whatsoever and I can't
imagine<00:02:51.690> why<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:52.080> did<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.470> back<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
imagine why they did this back in the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.979 
imagine why they did this back in the
Droid<00:02:53.340> slot<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.849> different<00:02:54.180> colors<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.780> sure

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
Droid slot in different colors I'm sure

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.420 
Droid slot in different colors I'm sure
it's<00:02:55.170> probably<00:02:55.620> something<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.310> with

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
it's probably something to do with

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.559 
it's probably something to do with
production<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.290> they<00:02:58.290> could<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> easily

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
production but they could have easily

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.580 
production but they could have easily
which<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.810> color<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.349> plastic<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.010> hang

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.550 

so<00:03:07.590> essentially<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.280> kit<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.390> way

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
so essentially this kit the way

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.559 
so essentially this kit the way
definitely<00:03:10.560> needs<00:03:10.829> a<00:03:11.130> full<00:03:11.400> paint<00:03:11.670> job<00:03:11.970> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
definitely needs a full paint job to

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.250 
definitely needs a full paint job to
bring<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.410> write<00:03:14.780> detailed<00:03:15.780> fare<00:03:16.170> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
bring it in to write detailed fare and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.000 
bring it in to write detailed fare and
there<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.829> decent<00:03:17.130> decent<00:03:17.850> enough<00:03:18.329> at<00:03:18.540> least

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.729 

but<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.100> could<00:03:23.250> definitely<00:03:23.430> use<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:24.180> little

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
but it could definitely use a little

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.879 
but it could definitely use a little
improvement<00:03:26.840> again<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:27.989> here<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> gold<00:03:28.650> isn't

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
improvement again up here the gold isn't

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.840 
improvement again up here the gold isn't
is<00:03:29.160> obvious<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.940> there<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.079> wing<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:32.579> it

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
is obvious in there on the wing but it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.849 
is obvious in there on the wing but it
is<00:03:33.000> definitely<00:03:33.329> there<00:03:33.900> there's<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.590> black

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
is definitely there there's a black

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.759 
is definitely there there's a black
stripe<00:03:35.370> right<00:03:35.670> here<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:39.079> they<00:03:40.079> did<00:03:40.350> get<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
stripe right here and they did get the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.520 
stripe right here and they did get the
stripes<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.549> engines<00:03:41.910> correct<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.350> it

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
stripes on the engines correct and it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.680 
stripes on the engines correct and it
pretty<00:03:46.709> much<00:03:46.829> saw<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.549> shot<00:03:47.880> already<00:03:48.269> from<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
pretty much saw this shot already from a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.989 
pretty much saw this shot already from a
different<00:03:48.930> angle

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:54.999 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.670 

and<00:03:55.999> again<00:03:56.299> this<00:03:56.510> angle<00:03:56.719> definitely<00:03:57.409> shows

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
and again this angle definitely shows

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.649 
and again this angle definitely shows
off<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.219> gold<00:03:58.430> along<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.999> cockpit<00:03:59.480> there

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
off the gold along the cockpit there

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.739 
off the gold along the cockpit there
really<00:04:00.049> nicely<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.999> along<00:04:01.999> this<00:04:02.239> wing<00:04:02.510> as

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:02.749 
really nicely and along this wing as

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:13.929 
really nicely and along this wing as
well<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:08.060> finally<00:04:08.359> a<00:04:08.629> front<00:04:08.900> shot<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:13.609> in<00:04:13.790> the

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
well and finally a front shot so in the

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.449 
well and finally a front shot so in the
most<00:04:14.090> basics<00:04:14.599> they<00:04:15.079> certainly<00:04:15.469> got<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.070> idea

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
most basics they certainly got the idea

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.490 
most basics they certainly got the idea
correct<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.329> great<00:04:17.660> stripe<00:04:18.019> here<00:04:18.289> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
correct this great stripe here is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.779 
correct this great stripe here is
correct<00:04:19.449> this<00:04:20.449> gray<00:04:20.810> here<00:04:21.340> maybe<00:04:22.340> that's

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
correct this gray here maybe that's

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.520 
correct this gray here maybe that's
tough<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.180> tell<00:04:23.330> from<00:04:23.389> this<00:04:23.720> particular<00:04:23.990> photo

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
tough to tell from this particular photo

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.140 
tough to tell from this particular photo
but<00:04:24.830> if<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.130> there<00:04:25.370> should<00:04:25.550> be<00:04:25.580> more<00:04:25.940> up<00:04:26.120> front

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
but if so there should be more up front

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.390 
but if so there should be more up front
there<00:04:26.840> should<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.169> yellow<00:04:27.410> going<00:04:27.830> across<00:04:28.039> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
there should be yellow going across the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.089 
there should be yellow going across the
front<00:04:31.539> looks<00:04:32.539> like<00:04:32.750> there's<00:04:33.020> spirals<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.830> this

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
front looks like there's spirals on this

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.480 
front looks like there's spirals on this
gun<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.199> didn't<00:04:36.740> see<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.220> any<00:04:37.370> other

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
gun but I didn't see that in any other

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.939 
gun but I didn't see that in any other
photos

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
photos

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.249 
photos
so<00:04:39.949> yeah<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.310> what<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.759> you<00:04:41.720> know<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:42.110> have

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
so yeah for what it is you know you have

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.100 
so yeah for what it is you know you have
to<00:04:42.410> consider<00:04:42.710> it's<00:04:42.919> definitely<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> toy

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
to consider it's definitely a toy

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.589 
to consider it's definitely a toy
however<00:04:45.280> they<00:04:46.280> did<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.520> basic<00:04:46.759> good<00:04:47.120> job<00:04:47.389> with

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
however they did a basic good job with

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.540 
however they did a basic good job with
it<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.020> with<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.710> little<00:04:48.860> love<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.460> an

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
it and with just a little love to an

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.689 
it and with just a little love to an
airbrush<00:04:50.000> maybe<00:04:50.479> some<00:04:50.780> putty<00:04:51.020> here<00:04:51.289> and<00:04:51.500> there

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
airbrush maybe some putty here and there

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.400 
airbrush maybe some putty here and there
some<00:04:52.699> magnets<00:04:53.240> for<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.539> wings<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:54.020> get<00:04:54.199> those

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
some magnets for the wings to get those

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.010 
some magnets for the wings to get those
to<00:04:54.650> shut<00:04:54.889> closed<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.610> think<00:04:56.449> you<00:04:56.539> really<00:04:56.810> could

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
to shut closed I think you really could

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.330 
to shut closed I think you really could
have<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.590> really<00:04:57.949> nice<00:04:58.130> x-wing<00:04:59.120> replica<00:04:59.720> here

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.430 

that's<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.520> for<00:05:04.699> this<00:05:04.759> one<00:05:05.320> thanks<00:05:06.320> for

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440
