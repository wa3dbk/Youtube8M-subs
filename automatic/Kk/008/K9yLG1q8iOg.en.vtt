improvement<00:01:43.390> over<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:44.290> second

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
improvement over the the second

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.830 
improvement over the the second
generation<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.400> being<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.820> third<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.420> think

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
generation this being the third I think

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.080 
generation this being the third I think
that<00:01:46.960> was<00:01:47.110> very<00:01:47.170> boxy<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.280> sort<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.700> coming<00:01:49.000> in

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
that was very boxy and sort of coming in

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
that was very boxy and sort of coming in
line<00:01:49.299> with<00:01:49.570> what<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.840> expect<00:01:50.170> from<00:01:50.229> Honda

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
line with what you expect from Honda

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.060 
line with what you expect from Honda
yeah<00:01:51.130> yeah<00:01:51.400> they<00:01:51.729> said<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.119> whether<00:01:53.070> he

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
yeah yeah they said that whether he

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.250 
yeah yeah they said that whether he
points<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.610> hit<00:01:54.850> was<00:01:55.060> making<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.750> more<00:01:55.900> sleek

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
points to hit was making it more sleek

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.500 
points to hit was making it more sleek
the<00:01:56.439> people<00:01:56.740> who<00:01:56.920> didn't<00:01:57.729> buy<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.939> pilot

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
the people who didn't buy the pilot

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.630 
the people who didn't buy the pilot
decided<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.530> fact<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.010> was<00:02:00.130> too<00:02:00.400> boxy

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
decided the fact that it was too boxy

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.190 
decided the fact that it was too boxy
and<00:02:00.909> made<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.330> looked<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.960> wasn't

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
and made it looked like it wasn't

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.859 
and made it looked like it wasn't
fuel-efficient<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.520> they<00:02:03.850> obviously<00:02:04.119> changed

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
fuel-efficient so they obviously changed

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.570 
fuel-efficient so they obviously changed
it<00:02:04.990> made<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.290> look<00:02:05.380> more<00:02:05.439> stylish<00:02:06.070> Morris<00:02:06.340> will

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
it made it look more stylish Morris will

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460 
it made it look more stylish Morris will
be<00:02:06.700> more<00:02:06.939> modern<00:02:07.299> got<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.780> dad

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
be more modern got a dad

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.370 
be more modern got a dad
I<00:02:08.500> think<00:02:08.860> they<00:02:08.950> added<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.729> edge<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.119> these<00:02:10.380> LED

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
and by the way you may be wondering why

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.780 
and by the way you may be wondering why
we've<00:02:29.110> got<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.380> two<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.190> three-quarter

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
we've got this two and three-quarter

ducky<00:02:33.120> 177<00:02:34.120> talking<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.780> us<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.440> have

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
ducky 177 talking to us because we have

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.560 
ducky 177 talking to us because we have
to<00:02:35.620> follow<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.100> scent<00:02:36.430> driver<00:02:36.790> out<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.210> Honda

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
to follow a scent driver out that Honda

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.840 
to follow a scent driver out that Honda
has<00:02:37.750> given<00:02:38.020> us<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.800> guess<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.310> could<00:02:39.490> go<00:02:39.640> off

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
has given us so I guess we could go off

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.730 
has given us so I guess we could go off
route<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.660> creates<00:02:41.020> all<00:02:41.200> kinds<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.590> havoc

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
route but it creates all kinds of havoc

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.640 
route but it creates all kinds of havoc
so<00:02:42.160> excuse<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.090> navigation<00:02:43.810> system<00:02:44.200> but

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
so excuse the navigation system but

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.110 
so excuse the navigation system but
that's<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.310> something<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:45.700> have<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.970> deal

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that's just something we have to deal

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.760 
that's just something we have to deal
with<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.480> agree<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:46.930> mean<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.320> colors<00:02:47.620> are

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
with I agree I mean the colors are

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.120 
with I agree I mean the colors are
pretty<00:02:48.160> muted<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.840> can't<00:02:50.230> talk<00:02:50.590> about<00:02:50.800> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
pretty muted so we can't talk about the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.370 
pretty muted so we can't talk about the
technology<00:02:51.730> that's<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.810> car<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.230> what

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
technology that's in this car but what

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.260 
technology that's in this car but what
we<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.710> say<00:02:53.950> Nick<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.880> lot<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
we can say Nick is that a lot of the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.270 
we can say Nick is that a lot of the
competing<00:02:55.600> cars<00:02:55.870> like<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> Highlander<00:02:56.500> is

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
competing cars like the Highlander is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.240 
competing cars like the Highlander is
like<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.700> Nissan<00:02:59.490> Pathfinder<00:03:00.510> exactly

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
like the Nissan Pathfinder exactly

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.250 
like the Nissan Pathfinder exactly
Durango<00:03:03.250> Grand<00:03:03.550> Cherokee<00:03:04.000> yeah<00:03:04.570> these<00:03:05.110> are

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
Durango Grand Cherokee yeah these are

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.350 
Durango Grand Cherokee yeah these are
the<00:03:05.350> competitive<00:03:05.800> sets<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.220> vehicles<00:03:06.580> offer<00:03:06.940> a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
the competitive sets of vehicles offer a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.840 
the competitive sets of vehicles offer a
lot<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.900> technology<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.530> lane<00:03:09.460> keep<00:03:09.700> assist

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
lot of technology like lane keep assist

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.390 
lot of technology like lane keep assist
where<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.450> car<00:03:10.660> stays<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.080> its<00:03:11.200> lane<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.740> pre

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
where the car stays in its lane a pre

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.070 
where the car stays in its lane a pre

competitors set of vehicles have and I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.380 
competitors set of vehicles have and I
would<00:03:26.680> suspect<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:27.310> Honda<00:03:27.910> would<00:03:28.150> want<00:03:28.330> to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
would suspect that Honda would want to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.740 
would suspect that Honda would want to
play<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.840> same<00:03:29.880> ballpark<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.270> even<00:03:31.570> some

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
play in that same ballpark and even some

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.260 
play in that same ballpark and even some
fuel<00:03:32.050> saving<00:03:32.440> technologies<00:03:33.070> like<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.760> would

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
fuel saving technologies like I would

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.430 
fuel saving technologies like I would
hope<00:03:34.420> whether<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:34.720> would<00:03:34.810> put<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:35.200> car

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
hope whether they would put in this car

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.690 
hope whether they would put in this car
would<00:03:35.560> be<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.830> sillim<00:03:36.190> some<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.610> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
would be like sillim some of the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.880 
would be like sillim some of the
management<00:03:37.030> maybe<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:38.200> know<00:03:38.380> if<00:03:38.590> they<00:03:38.739> have

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
management maybe a you know if they have

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.010 
management maybe a you know if they have
a<00:03:38.920> v6<00:03:39.489> engine<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.090> perhaps<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.600> would<00:03:40.810> go

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
a v6 engine in it perhaps that would go

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.890 
a v6 engine in it perhaps that would go
and<00:03:41.350> not<00:03:42.100> usual<00:03:42.459> all<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.150> six<00:03:43.390> cylinders

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
and not usual all the six cylinders

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.320 
and not usual all the six cylinders
maybe<00:03:44.260> they<00:03:44.440> would<00:03:44.620> help<00:03:45.160> some<00:03:45.370> pol<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.120> look

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
maybe they would help some pol you look

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.150 
maybe they would help some pol you look
up<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> fuel<00:03:46.750> economy<00:03:46.930> huge<00:03:47.500> maybe<00:03:48.070> a

up a fuel economy huge maybe a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160 
up a fuel economy huge maybe a
stop-start<00:03:48.430> system<00:03:48.820> maybe<00:03:49.630> something<00:03:50.050> like

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
stop-start system maybe something like

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.510 
stop-start system maybe something like
that<00:03:50.350> yeah<00:03:50.620> exactly<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.280> might<00:03:51.430> be

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
that yeah exactly that might be

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.160 
that yeah exactly that might be
something<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.510> competitors<00:03:53.020> would

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
something that the competitors would

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:11.839 
something that the competitors would
have<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.530> they<00:03:53.620> wanna<00:03:53.860> include<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.370> car

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.500 

well<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> think<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.659> was<00:04:12.900> probably<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.769> first

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
well I think that was probably the first

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.710 
well I think that was probably the first
