millimeter<00:00:40.829> beam<00:00:41.309> coupled<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> fact<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
millimeter beam coupled with the fact is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
millimeter beam coupled with the fact is
got<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.899> stiffness<00:00:43.230> rate<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> 70<00:00:44.280> made<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
got a stiffness rate in the 70 made it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.459 
got a stiffness rate in the 70 made it
unlike<00:00:45.239> any<00:00:45.480> other<00:00:45.629> racquet<00:00:45.989> already<00:00:46.289> hit

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
unlike any other racquet already hit

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
unlike any other racquet already hit
with<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.980> definitely<00:00:47.520> worth<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.180> dime<00:00:48.329> over

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with it's definitely worth a dime over

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.170 
with it's definitely worth a dime over
from<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> guess<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.910> really

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
from the guess of that you can really

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.689 
from the guess of that you can really
attack<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> ball<00:00:51.899> 11<00:00:52.680> penetrates<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> court

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
attack the ball 11 penetrates the court

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
attack the ball 11 penetrates the court
and<00:00:53.850> pass<00:00:54.059> through<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> ball<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:56.899> swing<00:00:57.899> way

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and pass through the ball and swing way

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
and pass through the ball and swing way
right<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> 340s<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.910> you're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
right up there in the 340s so you're

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.130 
right up there in the 340s so you're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
not quite as rounded head shape as this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
not quite as rounded head shape as this
one<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.450> one's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.049> rounded<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
one and this one's a lot more rounded it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.960 
one and this one's a lot more rounded it
was<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.890> opened<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> sweet<00:01:17.670> spot<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
was actually opened up the sweet spot a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
was actually opened up the sweet spot a
lot<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.869> even<00:01:19.080> though<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.290> got<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
lot more so even though it's got that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
lot more so even though it's got that
high<00:01:19.830> swing<00:01:20.100> weight<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:20.939> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
high swing weight it's also it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
high swing weight it's also it's
actually<00:01:21.659> quite<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> forgiving<00:01:22.380> racket<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
actually quite a forgiving racket on

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
actually quite a forgiving racket on
off-center<00:01:23.340> hit<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> said<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.570> way

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
off-center hit and like I said the way

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
off-center hit and like I said the way
but<00:01:24.960> maps<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.560> pass<00:01:25.740> through<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> ball

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
but maps really pass through the ball

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.370 
but maps really pass through the ball
so<00:01:27.180> hibbett<00:01:27.600> their<00:01:28.490> head<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.670> speed<00:01:30.150> Pro

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.240 

what's<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> ready<00:01:37.680> picked<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.310> kind<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
what's the ready picked up it's kind of

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
what's the ready picked up it's kind of
stayed<00:01:41.250> looking<00:01:41.490> stable<00:01:41.850> sort<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> rally<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
stayed looking stable sort of rally we

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
stayed looking stable sort of rally we
really<00:01:43.020> shined<00:01:43.260> down<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.070> flat

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
really shined down for this little flat

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.620 
really shined down for this little flat
shots<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:44.910> you<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.060> too<00:01:45.270> much<00:01:45.420> spin

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shots there when you get too much spin

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390 
shots there when you get too much spin
from<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.770> worked<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.190> streambed

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
from it I think it worked the streambed

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.330 
from it I think it worked the streambed
worked<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.120> flat<00:01:48.450> shot<00:01:49.130> nice<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
worked better as a flat shot nice and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.860 
worked better as a flat shot nice and
tighten<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.760> near<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.180> net<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> said

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
tighten it up near the net but as I said

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.940 
tighten it up near the net but as I said
it's<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.050> heavy<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:52.560> difficult<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's very heavy so it's difficult to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.150 
it's very heavy so it's difficult to
keep<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:54.200> as<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.500> tall<00:01:55.710> frame<00:01:55.950> there's

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
keep up but as it's a tall frame there's

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.470 
keep up but as it's a tall frame there's
a<00:01:56.190> lots<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.400> control<00:01:56.760> if<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.150> can<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
a lots of control if you can get it

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.210 
a lots of control if you can get it
right<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.140> swing<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:59.160> it

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
right and get the right swing I think it

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.190 
right and get the right swing I think it
would<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> better<00:01:59.820> for<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.150> more<00:02:00.420> flatter<00:02:00.870> swing

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
would be better for a more flatter swing

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
would be better for a more flatter swing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
rather than mine it would be a very

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.690 
rather than mine it would be a very

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
solid racket for a high-end player

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.419 
solid racket for a high-end player
mainly<00:02:06.090> tall<00:02:06.300> players<00:02:06.570> top-end<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> it's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
mainly tall players top-end use and it's
