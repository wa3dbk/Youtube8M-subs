Philip<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.329> do<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.359> close-up<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.139> fact<00:03:22.380> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
Philip to do a close-up on the fact that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.839 
Philip to do a close-up on the fact that
we<00:03:22.769> use<00:03:23.299> velcro<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.950> velcro<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.609> not<00:03:26.819> a

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
we use velcro this is velcro it's not a

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.990 
we use velcro this is velcro it's not a
copy<00:03:27.150> velcro<00:03:27.810> rate<00:03:28.019> from<00:03:28.169> velcro<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
copy velcro rate from velcro and the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.330 
copy velcro rate from velcro and the
operating<00:03:30.450> temperature<00:03:31.139> of<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.919> adhesive

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
operating temperature of this adhesive

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.990 
operating temperature of this adhesive
is<00:03:33.769> two<00:03:34.769> hundred<00:03:34.919> and<00:03:35.099> forty-five<00:03:35.489> degrees

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is two hundred and forty-five degrees

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.640 
is two hundred and forty-five degrees

Fahrenheit above two seventy five below

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.420 
Fahrenheit above two seventy five below
Fahrenheit<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.660> you've<00:03:42.660> got<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> problem<00:03:43.430> for

Fahrenheit so you've got a problem for

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.140 
Fahrenheit so you've got a problem for
some<00:03:44.639> reason<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.459> adhesive<00:03:47.730> then

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
some reason and with the adhesive then

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
some reason and with the adhesive then
you<00:03:48.299> must<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.599> cycling<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.230> temperatures

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you must be cycling in temperatures

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.199 
you must be cycling in temperatures
