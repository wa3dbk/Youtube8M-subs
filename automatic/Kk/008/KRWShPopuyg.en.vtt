00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
practiced you get an idea where the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.540 
practiced you get an idea where the

when<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.789> not<00:01:38.819> scoped<00:01:39.300> in<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:39.869> line<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.200> up

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
when you're not scoped in you line it up

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.169 
when you're not scoped in you line it up
to<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.740> target<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.310> almost<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:41.970> center

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179

to your target is almost in the center
of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.539> screen<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.530> do

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
of the screen so that when you do

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.370 
of the screen so that when you do
actually<00:01:44.069> zoom<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:44.819> you<00:01:45.179> will<00:01:45.300> almost<00:01:45.569> be<00:01:46.020> over

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually zoom in you will almost be over

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.980 
actually zoom in you will almost be over
where<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.130> enemy<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.599> tip<00:01:48.810> for

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.300 
doing this is to use your crosshairs
when<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.300> not<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.660> deist<00:01:52.050> in<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.099> use

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
when you're not a deist in and to use

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.400 
when you're not a deist in and to use
that<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.729> roughly<00:01:54.119> estimate<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.959> put<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
that to roughly estimate and put the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.830 
that to roughly estimate and put the
target<00:01:55.709> in<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.610> center<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.060> screen<00:01:57.209> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
target in the center of your screen so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.169 
target in the center of your screen so
that<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.410> do<00:01:58.770> zoom<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.819> will<00:01:59.970> be

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
that when you do zoom in you will be

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.320 
that when you do zoom in you will be
over<00:02:00.690> your<00:02:00.810> enemy<00:02:01.910> hopefully<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.149> all

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
over your enemy hopefully this is all

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.120 
over your enemy hopefully this is all
made<00:02:03.509> since<00:02:03.780> I've<00:02:03.899> tried<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.410> explain<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:05.009> in

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
made since I've tried to explain it in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
made since I've tried to explain it in
the<00:02:05.160> clearest<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.849> possibly<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.899> all

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the clearest way possibly but it's all

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
the clearest way possibly but it's all
about<00:02:07.229> making<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:08.039> enemy<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.880> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
about making sure the enemy is in the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
about making sure the enemy is in the
middle<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.450> screen<00:02:09.569> before<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.649> zoom<00:02:10.890> in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
middle of your screen before you zoom in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.420 
middle of your screen before you zoom in
if<00:02:11.340> you're<00:02:12.030> using<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.750> pld<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
if you're using the pld what you can

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.880 
if you're using the pld what you can
actually<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:15.870> sure<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.260> enemy<00:02:16.709> is

actually do is make sure the enemy is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.400 
actually do is make sure the enemy is
dead<00:02:17.220> center<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> your<00:02:17.940> pld<00:02:18.569> when<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.170> use

dead center of your pld when you use

a to<00:02:32.070> your<00:02:32.280> primary<00:02:32.490> weapon<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.120> zoom<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.540> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a to your primary weapon and zoom in you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.990 
a to your primary weapon and zoom in you
should<00:02:34.110> near<00:02:34.410> enough<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:35.040> zoomed<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.850> the

should near enough be zoomed in on the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
exact same place as you assumed in on

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.570 
exact same place as you assumed in on
your<00:02:38.670> pld<00:02:39.240> that's<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:40.050> reason<00:02:40.290> i<00:02:40.680> use<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.070> pld

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
your pld that's one reason i use the pld

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.820 
your pld that's one reason i use the pld
binoculars<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.960> when<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.290> sniping

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
binoculars a lot when I'm sniping

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.620 
binoculars a lot when I'm sniping
because<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.400> almost<00:02:44.580> line<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.360> target

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
because you can almost line up a target

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.110 
because you can almost line up a target
exactly<00:02:46.470> before<00:02:47.130> switching<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.850> primary

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
exactly before switching to your primary

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.750 
exactly before switching to your primary
and<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:48.900> zooming<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.440> anyway<00:02:50.340> i<00:02:50.370> hope<00:02:50.459> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and then zooming in anyway i hope this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.250 
and then zooming in anyway i hope this
has<00:02:50.910> made<00:02:51.090> sense<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.510> i<00:02:51.600> hope<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.900> helped<00:02:52.140> at

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
has made sense and i hope it's helped at

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
has made sense and i hope it's helped at
least<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.560> few<00:02:52.740> people<00:02:53.190> out<00:02:53.310> there<00:02:53.550> thank<00:02:54.090> you
