benchmark<00:00:19.890> using<00:00:20.220> quadrants<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.570> we've<00:00:21.660> got

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
benchmark using quadrants but we've got

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
benchmark using quadrants but we've got
some<00:00:21.930> rather<00:00:22.260> inconsistent<00:00:22.680> results<00:00:23.039> that's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
some rather inconsistent results that's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.070 
some rather inconsistent results that's
very<00:00:23.820> much<00:00:24.000> inconsistent<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.630> terms<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.930> what

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
very much inconsistent in terms of what

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.330 
very much inconsistent in terms of what
we<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> specification<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
we know the specification in the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.750 
we know the specification in the
performance<00:00:26.869> should<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.949> are

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
performance should be so are

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.930 
performance should be so are
nevertheless<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.900> thought<00:00:31.230> we'd<00:00:31.380> come<00:00:31.560> back

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
nevertheless we thought we'd come back

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.139 
nevertheless we thought we'd come back
we'll<00:00:32.940> run<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.360> antutu<00:00:33.630> benchmark<00:00:33.860> instead

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
we'll run on antutu benchmark instead

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
we'll run on antutu benchmark instead
just<00:00:36.149> by<00:00:36.390> way<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> comparison<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.500> we'll<00:00:38.190> go

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
just by way of comparison and we'll go

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
just by way of comparison and we'll go
ahead<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.510> run<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:42.600> think

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
ahead and run that right now I think

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.869 
ahead and run that right now I think
part<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> reason<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.370> seeing<00:00:44.760> these

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
part of the reason we are seeing these

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.750 
part of the reason we are seeing these
inconsistent<00:00:45.600> results<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:49.760> it's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
inconsistent results is because it's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
inconsistent results is because it's
because<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.300> Android<00:00:51.660> 4.4<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:54.530> say

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because we are Android 4.4 and say

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900 
because we are Android 4.4 and say
quadrant<00:00:55.980> needs<00:00:56.100> obviously<00:00:56.250> having<00:00:56.760> some

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
quadrant needs obviously having some

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.439 
quadrant needs obviously having some
issues<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> running<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.809> benchmarks

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
issues of running these benchmarks

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.490 
issues of running these benchmarks
because<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> results<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:01.020> coming<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.469> with

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
because the results are coming out with

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
because the results are coming out with
completely<00:01:02.100> inconsistent<00:01:02.550> numbers<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> terms

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
completely inconsistent numbers in terms

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.940 
completely inconsistent numbers in terms
of<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.260> expect<00:01:04.580> with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> 2.26

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950

we're<00:01:10.619> getting<00:01:10.799> benchmark<00:01:11.189> scores<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> around

we're getting benchmark scores of around

we're getting benchmark scores of around
seven<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.450> eight<00:01:12.630> thousand<00:01:13.439> mark<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.979> would

seven or eight thousand mark we would

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
seven or eight thousand mark we would
expect<00:01:14.430> something<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.659> realistically<00:01:16.049> about

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
expect something now realistically about

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.490 
expect something now realistically about
three<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:16.950> four<00:01:17.040> times<00:01:17.340> higher<00:01:17.610> than<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
three or four times higher than that so

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
three or four times higher than that so
and<00:01:19.500> 22<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.030> any

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and 22 we're going to see if we get any

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
and 22 we're going to see if we get any
more<00:01:22.040> consistent<00:01:23.040> result<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> terms<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> what

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
more consistent result in terms of what

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
more consistent result in terms of what
we're<00:01:24.090> expecting<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:27.560> see<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.710> our<00:01:28.740> results

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we're expecting and see what our results

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.130 
we're expecting and see what our results
come<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.210> pop<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.720> down<00:01:30.990> on

come out to be just pop back down on

that table there just soon a wee bit o
it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.859 
it
you<00:01:40.820> can<00:01:40.909> see<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.330> benchmark<00:01:41.780> running<00:01:43.869> and

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
you can see the benchmark running and

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.039 
you can see the benchmark running and
then<00:01:45.020> we'll<00:01:45.200> do<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.470> we'll<00:01:46.659> grab<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.780> score

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
then we'll do is we'll grab the score

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.580 
then we'll do is we'll grab the score
