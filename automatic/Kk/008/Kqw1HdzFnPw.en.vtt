pretty much just piece everything so

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:22.630 
pretty much just piece everything so
yeah<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.190> section

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.270 

so<00:00:23.570> it's<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:24.020> to<00:00:24.140> start<00:00:24.500> off<00:00:24.620> first<00:00:24.830> string

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
so it's going to start off first string

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.600 
so it's going to start off first string
first<00:00:25.310> fat<00:00:25.990> it's<00:00:26.990> gonna<00:00:27.170> be<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.350> pull<00:00:27.590> off<00:00:27.740> open

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
first fat it's gonna be a pull off open

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.210 
first fat it's gonna be a pull off open
second<00:00:29.000> string

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
second string

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.200 
second string
and<00:00:30.310> then<00:00:31.050> third<00:00:32.050> string<00:00:32.290> on<00:00:32.410> a<00:00:32.439> second<00:00:33.210> Bowl

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
and then third string on a second Bowl

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.560 
and then third string on a second Bowl
off<00:00:34.390> open<00:00:34.960> fourth<00:00:35.230> string<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:37.149> fifth

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
off open fourth string and then fifth

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:48.340 
off open fourth string and then fifth
string<00:00:37.780> on<00:00:37.960> third<00:00:38.460> festival<00:00:39.460> also

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.890 

and<00:00:49.070> then<00:00:49.220> it's<00:00:49.430> gonna<00:00:49.520> quickly<00:00:49.760> skip<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.540> the

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
and then it's gonna quickly skip to the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.529 
and then it's gonna quickly skip to the
fifth<00:00:51.170> fret<00:00:51.410> if<00:00:51.920> you're<00:00:52.100> in<00:00:52.250> debt

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:09.250 

so<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.589> gonna<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:04.790> open<00:01:05.790> second

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.580 

I<00:01:09.320> went<00:01:09.800> there<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.490> hammer<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
I went there and the hammer on the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.350 
I went there and the hammer on the
fourth<00:01:12.980> fret<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.820> 3rd<00:01:15.340> open<00:01:16.340> 2nd<00:01:16.880> open<00:01:17.150> for

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
fourth fret on the 3rd open 2nd open for

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:29.179 
fourth fret on the 3rd open 2nd open for
yourself

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.709 

so<00:01:29.609> keep<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.939> mind<00:01:29.969> you're<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
so keep in mind you're going to be

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:42.390 
so keep in mind you're going to be
covering<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> fifth<00:01:31.350> pair<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.740> set<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.890 

and<00:01:43.400> then<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.270> time<00:01:44.510> you're<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
and then this time you're going to

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.830 
and then this time you're going to
double<00:01:45.200> bass<00:01:45.380> on<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.650> fifth<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.400> string

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.350 

so<00:01:51.560> once<00:01:52.100> again<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.460> same<00:01:52.640> pattern<00:01:53.000> except

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
so once again the same pattern except

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.539 
so once again the same pattern except
with<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.540> first<00:01:53.810> on<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.560> first<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
with the first on the first and the

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.920 
with the first on the first and the
third<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.649> second

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:24.690 

so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.040 

so<00:02:25.700> once<00:02:25.970> you've<00:02:26.120> gotten<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.510> comfortable

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
so once you've gotten really comfortable

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.690 
so once you've gotten really comfortable
playing<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.530> first<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.920> second<00:02:28.220> verse<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
playing the first and second verse and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940 
playing the first and second verse and
you<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:29.540> own<00:02:29.570> sequence<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.500> repeats

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
you have your own sequence of repeats

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.220 
you have your own sequence of repeats
that<00:02:31.340> sound<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.970> way<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.150> want<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.600> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
that sound the way you want it to you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.810 
that sound the way you want it to you
move<00:02:33.380> on<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.770> section<00:02:34.040> which<00:02:34.430> connects

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
move on to this section which connects

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.670 
move on to this section which connects
it<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.210> bridge<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:36.140> going<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.350> start<00:02:36.560> off

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
it to the bridge it's going to start off

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.860 
it to the bridge it's going to start off
with<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> harmonic<00:02:37.310> slap<00:02:37.550> on<00:02:37.850> 3rd<00:02:38.210> 2nd<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.720> 1st

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
with a harmonic slap on 3rd 2nd and 1st

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.190 
with a harmonic slap on 3rd 2nd and 1st
just<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.380> general<00:02:39.770> area<00:02:39.920> anyways<00:02:41.200> followed

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
just that general area anyways followed

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.010 
just that general area anyways followed
by<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.380> hammer<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.920> 3rd<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.810> 6th<00:02:44.810> then

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
by a hammer on the 3rd on the 6th then

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.860 
by a hammer on the 3rd on the 6th then
the<00:02:45.170> 5th<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.400> sounds<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:53.570> another

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the 5th so sounds like and then another

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.980 
the 5th so sounds like and then another
harmonic<00:02:54.410> sly

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
harmonic sly

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.040 
harmonic sly
and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.740> on<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.280> price<00:02:57.490> my<00:02:57.700> preference<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
and then on this price my preference you

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.690 
and then on this price my preference you
can<00:02:59.080> pay<00:02:59.350> attention<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.830> Antoine's<00:03:00.190> video<00:03:00.520> if

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
can pay attention to Antoine's video if

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.280 
can pay attention to Antoine's video if
you<00:03:00.820> want<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> see<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.300> he<00:03:01.420> does<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.230> I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
you want to see what he does but I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.460 
you want to see what he does but I
hammer<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.890> 7th<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.640> then<00:03:04.360> my<00:03:04.630> pinky

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
hammer on the 7th and then my pinky

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.010 
hammer on the 7th and then my pinky
comes<00:03:05.770> around<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.520> does<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.450> all<00:03:07.660> seven

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
comes around and does this all seven

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.270 
comes around and does this all seven
harmonics<00:03:09.690> looks<00:03:10.690> kind<00:03:10.960> of<00:03:11.020> weird<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.620> feels

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
harmonics looks kind of weird but feels

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:25.880 
harmonics looks kind of weird but feels
cool<00:03:12.520> anyways<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.200> slow<00:03:14.350> motion

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.660 

all<00:03:26.890> right<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.680> till<00:03:29.680> like<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.310> part<00:03:30.520> that

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
all right so till like the part that

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.010 
all right so till like the part that
connects<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.540> part<00:03:31.780> goes<00:03:31.990> like

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
connects it to of that part goes like

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.410 
connects it to of that part goes like
this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:49.330 

actually<00:03:35.420> without

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.120 

and<00:03:49.580> then<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:49.970> move<00:03:50.120> on<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.870> verge

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
and then you move on to the verge

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.110 
and then you move on to the verge
actually<00:03:52.130> right<00:03:52.400> over<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.610> section<00:03:52.940> over
