00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
make the spot em layer active now we

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.750 
make the spot em layer active now we
want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.720> go<00:00:36.780> ahead<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> blur<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.920> darken

this<00:00:39.000> image<00:00:39.390> I'll<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:40.320> by<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.620> filter

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
this image I'll start by going filter

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
this image I'll start by going filter
blur<00:00:42.680> instead<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> using<00:00:43.920> Gaussian<00:00:44.550> blur<00:00:44.670> I'm

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
blur instead of using Gaussian blur I'm

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.550 
blur instead of using Gaussian blur I'm
going<00:00:45.060> to<00:00:45.120> use<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.390> new<00:00:45.570> lens<00:00:45.870> blur<00:00:46.050> filter

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
going to use the new lens blur filter

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.550 
going to use the new lens blur filter
and<00:00:47.390> I'm<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.600> take<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> radius<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
and I'm going to take the radius to

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.770 
and I'm going to take the radius to
about<00:00:49.830> 25<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:52.490> I<00:00:53.490> have<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.820> noise<00:00:54.060> set<00:00:54.510> 2<00:00:54.750> 3

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
about 25 and I have the noise set 2 3

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.140 
about 25 and I have the noise set 2 3
which<00:00:55.500> adds<00:00:55.740> a<00:00:55.950> little<00:00:56.070> grain<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.820> into<00:00:57.060> the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
which adds a little grain back into the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.850 
which adds a little grain back into the
image<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.630> prevents<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.260> Bandung<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860

you<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.980> looks<00:01:08.010> against<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
you see how that looks against the

you see how that looks against the

the output levels and darken the image

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.420 
the output levels and darken the image
down<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.780> makes<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.350> lot<00:01:22.650> less<00:01:22.860> contrast

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
down this makes it a lot less contrast

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
down this makes it a lot less contrast
here<00:01:23.670> than<00:01:23.910> trying<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.300> move<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.630> too<00:01:24.870> much

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.930 
neck so we don't have a too blurry down
here<00:03:49.440> i'll<00:03:50.310> go<00:03:50.430> ahead<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.580> turn<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
here i'll go ahead and turn on the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.360 
here i'll go ahead and turn on the
background<00:03:51.240> layer<00:03:51.570> again<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.310> think

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
background layer again and I think
