browning before you stir-fry so I'm

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.490 
browning before you stir-fry so I'm
heating<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> pan<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.390> find<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.960> nonstick<00:00:28.439> pan

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
heating up a pan I find a nonstick pan

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
heating up a pan I find a nonstick pan
actually<00:00:29.130> works<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.779> oil

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
actually works really well some oil

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.560 
actually works really well some oil
don't<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.740> shy<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.309> hot<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.149> once<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
don't be shy you get that hot so once I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
don't be shy you get that hot so once I
see<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.140> oil<00:00:37.170> shimmering<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.340> bit

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
see the oil shimmering a little bit

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.380 
see the oil shimmering a little bit
meaning<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.969> hot

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
meaning it's hot

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.430 
meaning it's hot
put<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> batch<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.379> here

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.740 

now<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> additional<00:00:50.130> step<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.750> unnecessary

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
now this additional step is unnecessary

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.050 
now this additional step is unnecessary
but<00:00:52.050> appreciated<00:00:52.830> sometimes<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.790> going<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
but appreciated sometimes it's going to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.490 
but appreciated sometimes it's going to
give<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.240> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.540> bit<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.930> chew<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> little

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
give it a little bit more chew a little

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
give it a little bit more chew a little
bit<00:00:55.650> more<00:00:55.890> texture<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> optional<00:00:59.120> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
bit more texture but it is optional the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.480 
bit more texture but it is optional the
key<00:01:00.360> here<00:01:00.630> is<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.080> to<00:01:01.350> stir<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.010> too<00:01:02.250> often

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
key here is not to stir it too often

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.490 
key here is not to stir it too often
because<00:01:03.060> we<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.450> letting<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.900> sit

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
because we are letting it sit

grab on now another type of hand that
will<00:01:06.840> work<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> cast<00:01:07.440> iron<00:01:07.710> pure<00:01:08.310> stainless

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
will work is cast iron pure stainless

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
will work is cast iron pure stainless
steel<00:01:08.940> tends<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> stick<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.870> so<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
steel tends to stick a lot so at this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
steel tends to stick a lot so at this
point<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.370> check<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.910> all<00:01:12.120> you

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.760 

so<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.329> browned<00:01:35.539> that<00:01:35.749> one<00:01:35.929> side<00:01:36.229> I'm<00:01:36.499> going<00:01:36.710> to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
so I browned that one side I'm going to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.499 
so I browned that one side I'm going to
give<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:36.950> one<00:01:36.979> stir<00:01:37.429> let<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.850> sit<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.240> couple

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
give it one stir let it sit for a couple

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.410 
give it one stir let it sit for a couple
more<00:01:38.630> minutes<00:01:38.749> and<00:01:39.109> then<00:01:39.409> out<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.770> comes<00:01:46.420> at

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
more minutes and then out it comes at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.300 
more minutes and then out it comes at
this<00:01:47.569> point<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.020> rate<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.350> stir-fry<00:01:48.770> now<00:01:49.249> you

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
this point the rate is stir-fry now you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.039 
this point the rate is stir-fry now you
can<00:01:49.609> do<00:01:49.789> this<00:01:49.939> ahead<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.270> time<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.630> store<00:01:50.840> them

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
can do this ahead of time and store them

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.469 
can do this ahead of time and store them
that<00:01:51.439> works<00:01:51.619> okay<00:01:51.979> stir<00:01:52.759> frying<00:01:53.030> Asian

use<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.729> wok<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.240> time<00:01:56.450> because<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.719> have<00:01:56.869> this

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
use a wok this time because I have this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.510 
use a wok this time because I have this
one<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.349> here<00:01:57.619> but<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.829> could<00:01:58.069> use<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.369> on

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
one right here but you could use this on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.910 
one right here but you could use this on
tape<00:01:58.759> in<00:01:58.969> either<00:01:59.270> would<00:01:59.509> work<00:01:59.689> high<00:02:00.349> heat

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
tape in either would work high heat

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.599 
tape in either would work high heat
