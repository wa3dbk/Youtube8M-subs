00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
now what do I think there's two camps of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
now what do I think there's two camps of
thought<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> reactionary<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.950> was

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
thought there is the reactionary I was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
thought there is the reactionary I was
at<00:01:44.250> breakfast<00:01:44.640> sunday<00:01:44.970> morning<00:01:45.299> when<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
at breakfast sunday morning when the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
at breakfast sunday morning when the
leaks<00:01:46.500> were<00:01:46.680> starting<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> come<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> yes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
leaks were starting to come out and yes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840 
leaks were starting to come out and yes
it<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.990> did<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.740> Call<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.490> Duty

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it really did look like Call of Duty

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
it really did look like Call of Duty
when<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.090> saw<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> aim<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.780> sights<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
when you saw the aim down sights and you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
when you saw the aim down sights and you
saw<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> jump<00:01:53.880> packs<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.479> thruster<00:01:54.869> packs

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
saw the jump packs the thruster packs

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
saw the jump packs the thruster packs
and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> internet<00:01:56.549> did<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.000> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and then the internet did what it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
and then the internet did what it's
great<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.420> kicking<00:01:57.810> screaming<00:01:58.170> yelling<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
great at kicking screaming yelling and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
great at kicking screaming yelling and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
getting angry there's two cams of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
getting angry there's two cams of
thought<00:02:01.200> there's<00:02:01.500> those<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.520> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
thought there's those that think it's a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
thought there's those that think it's a
call<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.880> duty<00:02:03.119> rip<00:02:03.270> off<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.630> 343<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.259> just

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
call of duty rip off and 343 is just

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.100 
call of duty rip off and 343 is just
implementing<00:02:05.070> things<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.700> oh<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.750> trying

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

to be caught oh they're ruining halo and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639 
to be caught oh they're ruining halo and
then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> wait<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.110> until<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
then you have the wait and see until you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.400 
then you have the wait and see until you
try<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> I'm

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
try it and I'm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.960 
try it and I'm
that<00:02:11.620> camp<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.130> hundred<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.490> fifty<00:02:12.700> percent

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
that camp one hundred and fifty percent

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.300 
that camp one hundred and fifty percent
I've<00:02:13.210> been<00:02:13.390> there<00:02:13.570> for<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.990> long<00:02:14.170> time<00:02:14.530> nothing

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
I've been there for a long time nothing

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
I've been there for a long time nothing
really<00:02:15.430> freaked<00:02:15.820> me<00:02:16.000> out<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.510> first<00:02:16.720> time<00:02:16.870> I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
really freaked me out the first time I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.350 
really freaked me out the first time I
saw<00:02:17.140> 80s<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.860> was<00:02:18.040> worried<00:02:18.370> until<00:02:18.760> he<00:02:19.000> found<00:02:19.120> out

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
saw 80s I was worried until he found out

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.180 
saw 80s I was worried until he found out
that<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.870> d<00:02:20.110> scope<00:02:20.350> there's<00:02:20.590> not<00:02:20.770> flinch

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that there is d scope there's not flinch

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.710 
that there is d scope there's not flinch
and<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.490> really<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.880> same<00:02:21.910> thing<00:02:22.120> as<00:02:22.510> zoom

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and it's really the same thing as zoom

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320 
and it's really the same thing as zoom
now<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.130> different<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:25.000> at

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
now it just is a different look at

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.630 
now it just is a different look at
different<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.960> way<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.920> graphics

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
different like way that the graphics

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.910 
different like way that the graphics
represent<00:02:28.150> what's<00:02:28.360> going<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.620> screen

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
represent what's going on on the screen

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.980 
represent what's going on on the screen
I<00:02:30.100> think<00:02:30.670> something<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.270> brilliant<00:02:31.630> is

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
I think something that is brilliant is

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.840 
I think something that is brilliant is
what<00:02:32.170> they've<00:02:32.320> done<00:02:32.470> with<00:02:32.680> sprint<00:02:33.130> even

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
what they've done with sprint even

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.800 
what they've done with sprint even
though<00:02:33.940> there's<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.210> lot<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> folks<00:02:34.570> who<00:02:34.690> don't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
though there's a lot of folks who don't

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
though there's a lot of folks who don't
think<00:02:35.050> sprint<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> place<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.800> Halo<00:02:36.340> I

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
think sprint have a place in Halo I

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.330 
think sprint have a place in Halo I
didn't<00:02:37.210> mind<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.600> in<00:02:37.720> Halo<00:02:38.110> 4<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:39.040> didn't

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
didn't mind it in Halo 4 and I didn't

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.760 
didn't mind it in Halo 4 and I didn't
mind<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.940> reach<00:02:40.300> but<00:02:41.020> what<00:02:41.230> they've<00:02:41.410> done

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
mind it in reach but what they've done

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.890 
mind it in reach but what they've done
is<00:02:42.100> if<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.610> sprint<00:02:43.030> your<00:02:43.270> shields<00:02:43.660> don't

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
is if you sprint your shields don't

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.920 
is if you sprint your shields don't
recharge<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.710> think<00:02:45.040> that's<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.310> very<00:02:45.490> small<00:02:46.030> but

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
recharge I think that's a very small but

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.050 
recharge I think that's a very small but
beautiful<00:02:47.290> adjustment<00:02:48.250> at<00:02:48.400> least<00:02:48.610> on<00:02:48.820> paper
