00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.120 
I will be showing you two ways to smoke
CT<00:01:34.659> depending<00:01:35.260> on<00:01:35.350> whether<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.680> plan<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.979> rush

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
CT depending on whether you plan to rush

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.950 
CT depending on whether you plan to rush
ramp<00:01:36.369> or<00:01:36.520> Palace<00:01:36.820> so<00:01:37.420> firstly<00:01:37.690> if<00:01:37.840> you're

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
ramp or Palace so firstly if you're

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.060 
ramp or Palace so firstly if you're
pushing<00:01:38.229> ramps<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.530> need<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.800> line<00:01:38.920> yourself

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
pushing ramps you need to line yourself

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.950 
pushing ramps you need to line yourself
up<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.640> side<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.090> strangely<00:01:40.600> looking

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
up to the side of this strangely looking

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.810 
up to the side of this strangely looking
out<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.290> scale<00:01:41.470> door<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.040> then<00:01:42.490> line<00:01:42.670> your

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
out of scale door and then line your

to the left of this antenna and then run

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320 
to the left of this antenna and then run
forward<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:43.730> you're<00:02:43.849> about<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.060> hit<00:02:44.239> the

the<00:02:53.330> second<00:02:53.630> smoke<00:02:53.810> I'll<00:02:53.959> use<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.170> window<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.590> a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the second smoke I'll use to window is a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.830 
the second smoke I'll use to window is a
lot<00:02:54.860> less<00:02:55.010> reliable<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:55.880> faster<00:02:56.390> but

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
lot less reliable but it is faster but

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.150 
lot less reliable but it is faster but
it<00:02:56.959> does<00:02:57.110> take<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.319> lot<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.590> time<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.890> complete

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
it does take a lot of time to complete

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
it does take a lot of time to complete
the<00:02:58.250> standard<00:02:58.579> one<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:58.790> your<00:02:58.910> team<00:02:59.060> are

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the standard one so your team are

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.580 
the standard one so your team are
usually<00:02:59.450> stuck<00:02:59.750> waiting<00:02:59.989> around<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.349> ramp

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the center of this antenna then move it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.979 
the center of this antenna then move it
slightly<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.880> right<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.329> then<00:03:08.599> jump<00:03:08.870> and

slightly to the right and then jump and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
slightly to the right and then jump and
throw<00:03:09.230> although<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> can't<00:03:10.310> stress<00:03:10.579> an<00:03:10.700> actual

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
but you need to throw literally the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.199 
but you need to throw literally the
second<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.010> jump<00:03:13.370> otherwise<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.970> won't<00:03:14.060> go

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
second you jump otherwise it won't go

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.759 
second you jump otherwise it won't go
far<00:03:14.450> enough<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.170> went<00:03:15.290> bounce<00:03:15.530> onto

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
far enough and then it went bounce onto

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.839 
far enough and then it went bounce onto
the<00:03:15.950> ledge<00:03:17.890> from<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.130> same<00:03:19.310> position<00:03:19.459> you

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
the ledge from this same position you

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.940 
the ledge from this same position you
can<00:03:20.000> also<00:03:20.150> smoke<00:03:20.569> short<00:03:20.840> quickly<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.470> aiming

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
can also smoke short quickly by aiming

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.229 
can also smoke short quickly by aiming
in<00:03:22.069> line<00:03:22.250> with<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.489> top<00:03:22.639> of<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.819> building

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.210 
in line with the top of this building
and<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:23.870> moving<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.260> process<00:03:24.650> light<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.130> the

and then moving a process light to the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.099 
and then moving a process light to the
right<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.880> will<00:03:25.940> then<00:03:26.359> bounce<00:03:26.660> off<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.930> roof

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
right it will then bounce off the roof

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:35.530 
right it will then bounce off the roof
and<00:03:27.319> then<00:03:27.470> into<00:03:27.709> short<00:03:34.120> you're<00:03:35.120> also<00:03:35.269> going<00:03:35.480> to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and then into short you're also going to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.090 
and then into short you're also going to
need<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.690> normal<00:03:36.079> way<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.230> smoke<00:03:36.560> short<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:37.010> the

that's it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.390 
that's it
this<00:04:26.990> will

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
the view from short on one side so again

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.129 
the view from short on one side so again
lining<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:42.850> up<00:04:42.910> with<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.150> gate<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.570> then<00:04:43.780> in

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
lining it up with the gate and then in

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.379 
lining it up with the gate and then in
the<00:04:44.290> middle<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.710> village<00:04:45.160> once<00:04:46.090> thrown

the middle of this village once thrown

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.820 
the middle of this village once thrown
it<00:04:46.570> will<00:04:46.660> roll<00:04:46.840> down<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.169> wall<00:04:47.320> nicely

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
it will roll down the wall nicely

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.320 
it will roll down the wall nicely
meaning<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.400> only<00:04:48.430> really<00:04:48.880> have<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.180> worry

now moving to the CT side this may seem

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.790 
now moving to the CT side this may seem
like<00:05:29.449> a<00:05:29.629> stupid<00:05:29.930> one<00:05:30.229> because<00:05:30.439> it<00:05:30.529> is<00:05:30.620> so

the wall which leaves gaps is

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.269 
the wall which leaves gaps is
unbelievable<00:05:38.689> so<00:05:38.900> this<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.710> a<00:05:39.740> quick<00:05:39.919> line<00:05:40.099> up

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
unbelievable so this is a quick line up

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.649 
unbelievable so this is a quick line up
with<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.460> edge<00:05:40.580> of<00:05:40.699> this<00:05:40.849> box<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.389> this

wooden ledge so if you were to do this

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.279 
wooden ledge so if you were to do this
