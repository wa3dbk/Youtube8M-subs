as well as they have 2,500 hit points so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970

they can take a lot of return fire also

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799

since<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> Dragons<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.120> air<00:00:45.329> troop<00:00:45.629> they

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
since the Dragons are an air troop they

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
since the Dragons are an air troop they
can<00:00:45.960> avoid<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> cannons<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> avoid<00:00:47.280> the

can avoid the cannons they can avoid the
mortars<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> person<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.870> their

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
mortars and if the person has their

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
mortars and if the person has their
expose<00:00:49.440> set<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> ground<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
expose set on ground you're gonna have a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
expose set on ground you're gonna have a
good<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.239> destroying<00:00:51.809> their<00:00:51.930> base<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
good time destroying their base so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
good time destroying their base so
something<00:00:53.340> cool<00:00:53.579> about<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.910> Dragons<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
something cool about the Dragons is that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
something cool about the Dragons is that
they<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.989> powerful<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.680> every<00:00:56.129> single<00:00:56.370> level

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
they are powerful at every single level

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510 
they are powerful at every single level
so<00:00:56.940> even<00:00:57.210> though<00:00:57.390> minor<00:00:57.660> level<00:00:57.899> 4<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.559> level<00:00:59.250> 1

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so even though minor level 4 at level 1

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
so even though minor level 4 at level 1
when<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> unlock<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.239> dragon<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.320> it

when you unlock your dragon you get it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
when you unlock your dragon you get it
at<00:01:01.530> townhall<00:01:01.739> 7<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> upgrade<00:01:02.609> your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
barracks to level 9 and at townhall 7

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
barracks to level 9 and at townhall 7
people<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:05.850> build<00:01:06.270> two<00:01:06.540> air<00:01:06.750> defense

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
people can only build two air defense

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
people can only build two air defense
and<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> people<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:08.520> even

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and a lot of people really don't even

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
and a lot of people really don't even
build<00:01:09.030> their<00:01:09.180> air<00:01:09.299> defense<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.350> don't

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
build their air defense they just don't

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.050 
build their air defense they just don't
think<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.040> need<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.820> ahead<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think they need it so you go ahead and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
think they need it so you go ahead and
you<00:01:12.270> train<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.630> dragons<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you train up your dragons and you can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
you train up your dragons and you can
steamroll<00:01:14.070> almost<00:01:14.670> any<00:01:14.850> base<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.020> since<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
steamroll almost any base so since the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.140 
steamroll almost any base so since the
dragons<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.159> powerful<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
dragons are so powerful they do take a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
dragons are so powerful they do take a
plateau<00:01:18.450> housing<00:01:18.840> space<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.259> take<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.530> 20

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
plateau housing space they take up 20

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
plateau housing space they take up 20
spots<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> guys<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.299> only<00:01:21.479> hold<00:01:21.810> 200

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
spots so if you guys can only hold 200

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
spots so if you guys can only hold 200
drat<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:22.979> 200<00:01:23.549> army<00:01:23.790> camp<00:01:23.970> spaces<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.780> only

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
drat or 200 army camp spaces you're only

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.020 
drat or 200 army camp spaces you're only
gonna<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.200> able<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.530> hold<00:01:25.680> 10<00:01:25.950> dragons<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.909> in

gonna be able to hold 10 dragons but in

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
gonna be able to hold 10 dragons but in
general<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:27.570> still<00:01:27.840> enough<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> steamroll

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
general that's still enough to steamroll

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
general that's still enough to steamroll
most<00:01:28.920> bases<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> come<00:01:29.670> across<00:01:29.790> across

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
most bases that you come across across

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
most bases that you come across across
at<00:01:30.630> least<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:31.079> lower<00:01:31.350> levels<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.610> yeah

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
at least at lower levels and yeah

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
at least at lower levels and yeah
they're<00:01:33.060> definitely<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.540> great<00:01:33.869> troop<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they're definitely a great troop so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.170 
they're definitely a great troop so
let's<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.280> ahead<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.490> talk<00:01:35.610> about<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:36.000> type

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
let's go ahead and talk about what type

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.520 
let's go ahead and talk about what type
of<00:01:36.210> army<00:01:36.509> compositions<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.409> use

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
of army compositions I like to use

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
of army compositions I like to use
dragons<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.060> personally<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> use

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
dragons in and for me personally I use

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.140 
dragons in and for me personally I use
them<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.560> different<00:01:40.590> scenarios<00:01:41.150> number

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
them in two different scenarios number

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.639 
them in two different scenarios number
one<00:01:42.329> believe<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.500> at

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
one believe it or not when I was at

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
one believe it or not when I was at
townhall<00:01:44.040> 7<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.520> townhall<00:01:44.880> 8<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.720> like

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
townhall 7 or townhall 8 I really like

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
townhall 7 or townhall 8 I really like
to<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.049> dragons<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:47.009> farming<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.579> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to use dragons when I was farming and I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.950 
to use dragons when I was farming and I
know<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> doesn't<00:01:48.299> make<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.750> sense

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
know that doesn't make a lot of sense

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
know that doesn't make a lot of sense
since<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.439> cost<00:01:49.799> 25,000<00:01:50.640> elixir<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> think

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
since they do cost 25,000 elixir I think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
since they do cost 25,000 elixir I think
at<00:01:51.450> level<00:01:51.780> 1<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> would<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
at level 1 but what I would do is I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
at level 1 but what I would do is I
would<00:01:53.430> bring<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.729> normal<00:01:54.270> farming

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
would bring my normal farming

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
would bring my normal farming
composition<00:01:55.140> I'd<00:01:55.290> bring<00:01:55.470> Giants<00:01:56.009> goblins

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
composition I'd bring Giants goblins

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.730 
composition I'd bring Giants goblins
wall<00:01:56.640> breakers<00:01:57.000> archers<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.869> I'd<00:01:57.990> also<00:01:58.200> sneak

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
wall breakers archers but I'd also sneak

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.859 
wall breakers archers but I'd also sneak
two<00:01:59.009> dragons<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.700> army<00:02:00.180> camps<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> would

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
two dragons in my army camps and I would

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.840 
two dragons in my army camps and I would
rarely<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.680> dragons<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.219> occasionally

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
rarely use the dragons but occasionally

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.090 
rarely use the dragons but occasionally
I'd<00:02:03.240> come<00:02:03.540> across<00:02:03.630> bases<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.770> would<00:02:04.950> have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
I'd come across bases that would have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.010 
I'd come across bases that would have
their<00:02:05.250> air<00:02:05.399> defense<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:06.420> low<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:06.810> some

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
their air defense really low or some

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.089 
their air defense really low or some
people<00:02:07.170> wouldn't<00:02:07.409> even<00:02:07.530> build<00:02:07.829> their<00:02:07.979> air

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
people wouldn't even build their air

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
people wouldn't even build their air
defense<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.489> can't<00:02:08.700> tell<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> guys<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.360> many

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
defense I can't tell you guys how many

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.020 
defense I can't tell you guys how many
people<00:02:09.780> neglect<00:02:09.989> their<00:02:10.229> air<00:02:10.379> defense

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
people neglect their air defense

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.610 
people neglect their air defense
and<00:02:11.120> for<00:02:11.390> those<00:02:11.510> people<00:02:11.569> they<00:02:12.290> might<00:02:12.470> have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and for those people they might have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.949 
and for those people they might have
like<00:02:12.800> 300<00:02:13.340> or<00:02:13.400> 400<00:02:13.880> thousand<00:02:14.240> resources<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
like 300 or 400 thousand resources and

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.300 
like 300 or 400 thousand resources and
all<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.800> drop<00:02:15.950> those<00:02:16.130> two

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
all I have to do is drop those two

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.550 
all I have to do is drop those two
dragons<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.910> they<00:02:17.300> will<00:02:17.450> destroy<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.110> entire

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
dragons and they will destroy the entire

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.559 
dragons and they will destroy the entire
base<00:02:19.040> I'm<00:02:19.520> telling<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.970> guys<00:02:20.060> they're<00:02:20.330> really

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
base I'm telling you guys they're really

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.630 
base I'm telling you guys they're really
really<00:02:20.930> powerful<00:02:21.110> at<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> low<00:02:21.650> level<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.130> since

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
really powerful at a low level and since

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.130 
really powerful at a low level and since
I<00:02:22.730> only<00:02:22.760> had<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> drop<00:02:23.300> those<00:02:23.480> two<00:02:23.630> dragons<00:02:23.870> I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
I only had to drop those two dragons I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.080 
I only had to drop those two dragons I
would<00:02:24.290> make<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> huge<00:02:24.830> profit<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.940> other

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
would make a huge profit the other

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
would make a huge profit the other
scenario<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.720> most<00:02:26.990> people<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.440> use

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
scenario that most people like to use

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.470 
scenario that most people like to use
dragons<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.340> like<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.940> raid<00:02:29.239> right

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
dragons it's like in this raid right

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
dragons it's like in this raid right
here<00:02:29.780> they<00:02:29.900> use<00:02:30.080> them<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.319> clan<00:02:30.560> wars<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.980> they

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
here they use them in clan wars and they

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.070 
here they use them in clan wars and they
will<00:02:31.550> use<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:32.030> mass<00:02:32.300> amount<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.750> them<00:02:32.900> so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
will use a mass amount of them so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.870 
will use a mass amount of them so
they'll<00:02:33.260> usually<00:02:33.440> train<00:02:33.890> maybe<00:02:34.100> 10<00:02:34.400> or<00:02:34.550> 11

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
they'll usually train maybe 10 or 11

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.210 
they'll usually train maybe 10 or 11
depending<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.480> how<00:02:36.050> many<00:02:36.110> army<00:02:36.620> camp<00:02:36.800> spaces

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
depending on how many army camp spaces

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
depending on how many army camp spaces
they<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.520> hold<00:02:37.700> or<00:02:38.120> they'll<00:02:38.810> bring<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.260> 9

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
they can hold or they'll bring like 9

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.140 
they can hold or they'll bring like 9
and<00:02:39.500> then<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> couple<00:02:40.069> minions<00:02:40.520> but<00:02:40.700> generally

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and then a couple minions but generally

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.820 
and then a couple minions but generally
people<00:02:41.270> will<00:02:41.510> use<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.110> try<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> get<00:02:42.500> two

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
people will use this to try to get two

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.070 
people will use this to try to get two
