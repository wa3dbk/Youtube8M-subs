00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
this I think that they tend to work the
best<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> slice<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.399> in

best you're just going to slice them in
half<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.780> give<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> quick<00:01:01.469> dice<00:01:01.770> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
half and then give them a quick dice so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.600

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.259 
cream right now this is why it's naughty
but<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.400> also<00:03:20.580> why<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.120> good

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
but this is also why it's really good

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.180 
but this is also why it's really good
and<00:03:21.870> I've<00:03:22.080> tried<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:22.680> milk<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
and I've tried it with milk and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.890 
and I've tried it with milk and
half-and-half<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> same

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
half-and-half and it's just not the same

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.710 
half-and-half and it's just not the same
so<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.880> kind<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.090> use<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.360> full<00:03:27.540> fat

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
so you got to kind of use the full fat

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.350 
so you got to kind of use the full fat
heavy<00:03:27.900> cream<00:03:28.280> once<00:03:29.280> your<00:03:29.489> sauce<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.910> nice<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
heavy cream once your sauce is nice and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.479 
heavy cream once your sauce is nice and
simmering<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.959> bubbling<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.100> add<00:03:32.280> a

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
simmering and bubbling you can add a

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.670 
simmering and bubbling you can add a
clove<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.820> garlic<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.050> garlic<00:03:34.350> is

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
clove of garlic so the garlic is

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650 
clove of garlic so the garlic is
basically<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.519> steep<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.390> warm

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
basically going to steep in that warm

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.120 
basically going to steep in that warm
cream<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.350> it's<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.739> create<00:03:38.100> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
cream and it's going to create a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.009 
cream and it's going to create a
beautiful<00:03:38.610> infused<00:03:39.390> garlic<00:03:39.810> flavor

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019

Parmesan cheese
now<00:05:55.330> when<00:05:55.450> heating<00:05:55.720> pesto<00:05:56.020> sauce<00:05:56.170> you<00:05:56.350> want<00:05:56.530> to

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
now when heating pesto sauce you want to

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.810 
now when heating pesto sauce you want to
be<00:05:56.680> careful<00:05:57.010> because<00:05:57.130> you<00:05:57.250> don't<00:05:57.340> want<00:05:57.640> to

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
be careful because you don't want to

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.430 
be careful because you don't want to
burn<00:05:57.940> the<00:05:58.000> cheese<00:05:58.420> and<00:05:58.810> sometimes<00:05:59.290> will

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
burn the cheese and sometimes will

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.750 
burn the cheese and sometimes will
happen<00:05:59.830> as<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.070> sauce<00:06:00.250> will<00:06:00.430> actually

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
happen as the sauce will actually

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.640 
happen as the sauce will actually
separate<00:06:01.210> on<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.200> better<00:06:02.350> thing<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
separate on you so the better thing to

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.560 
separate on you so the better thing to
do<00:06:02.740> I<00:06:02.770> think<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.580> take<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.940> cold<00:06:04.150> pesto

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
do I think is to take the cold pesto

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.840 
do I think is to take the cold pesto
sauce<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.050> mix<00:06:05.410> it<00:06:05.620> with<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.890> warm<00:06:06.130> pasta<00:06:06.430> and

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
sauce and mix it with the warm pasta and

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.730 
sauce and mix it with the warm pasta and
chances<00:06:07.450> are<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.810> heat<00:06:07.960> from<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.200> pasta<00:06:08.380> will

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
chances are the heat from the pasta will

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.230 
chances are the heat from the pasta will
actually<00:06:09.070> keep<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.400> sauce<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.910> you'll<00:06:10.150> be

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
actually keep the sauce and you'll be

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.810 
actually keep the sauce and you'll be
