00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
classes over a lot of other guns i know

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.139 
classes over a lot of other guns i know
the<00:01:59.009> grenade<00:01:59.250> launcher<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.880> strong

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the grenade launcher is really strong

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
the grenade launcher is really strong
but<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.259> don't<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:01.560> they're<00:02:01.920> getting

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
but I just don't think they're getting

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100 
but I just don't think they're getting
launcher<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.579> effective<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
launcher as effective as it was in the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
launcher as effective as it was in the
last<00:02:04.259> game<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> mean<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:05.880> pretty

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
last game but I mean it's still pretty

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
last game but I mean it's still pretty
effective<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.409> using

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
effective and then here you see me using

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.229 
effective and then here you see me using
the<00:02:08.069> shoulder<00:02:08.369> launcher<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> first<00:02:09.090> time

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the shoulder launcher for the first time

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
the shoulder launcher for the first time
and<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> splash<00:02:10.050> damage<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and you see the splash damage on it I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.589 
and you see the splash damage on it I
think<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> double<00:02:11.670> still<00:02:11.910> those<00:02:12.390> little

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
a couple scouts in the middle and I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
a couple scouts in the middle and I
think<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.950> scouts<00:03:14.280> are<00:03:15.110> pretty<00:03:16.110> good<00:03:16.260> when

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
think the scouts are pretty good when

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.170 
think the scouts are pretty good when
you're<00:03:16.800> finding<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> skull<00:03:17.340> with<00:03:17.700> Optimus

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
you're finding the skull with Optimus

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.240 
you're finding the skull with Optimus
because<00:03:18.450> he's<00:03:18.630> got<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.870> SMG<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:20.010> clean

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
because he's got that SMG you can clean

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.800 
because he's got that SMG you can clean
up<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.459> scout<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.910> whole<00:03:21.150> clip<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.540> those<00:03:21.660> of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
up a scout with a whole clip of those of

up a scout with a whole clip of those of
me<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.230> s<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.410> ion<00:03:22.950> blaster<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.670> don't<00:03:24.000> know

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
me that s the ion blaster I don't know

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.400 
me that s the ion blaster I don't know
why<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> keep<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.540> an<00:03:24.660> SMG<00:03:24.959> that's<00:03:25.230> what<00:03:25.320> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
why I keep on an SMG that's what it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.500 
why I keep on an SMG that's what it
feels<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.830> me<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.910> IM<00:03:27.180> bless<00:03:27.360> you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.300 
feels like to me but the IM bless you
can<00:03:27.660> clean<00:03:27.840> them<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:28.019> pretty<00:03:28.799> quick<00:03:29.100> with<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
can clean them up pretty quick with that

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.360 
can clean them up pretty quick with that
and<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.209> doesn't<00:03:30.620> vs<00:03:31.620> where<00:03:32.070> if<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> were

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and it doesn't vs where if you were

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.530 
and it doesn't vs where if you were
fighting<00:03:32.519> like<00:03:32.730> Megatron<00:03:33.030> you'd<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.420> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
fighting like Megatron you'd have to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.090 
fighting like Megatron you'd have to
reload<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.200> am<00:03:34.320> less<00:03:34.560> or<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:34.830> three

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
reload this I am less or like three

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.440 
reload this I am less or like three
times<00:03:35.340> before<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.700> clean<00:03:36.000> them<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.209> so

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
times before you clean them up so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.420 
times before you clean them up so
fighting<00:03:37.410> scouts<00:03:38.220> with<00:03:38.519> optimist<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.510> plus

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
fighting scouts with optimist is a plus

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.550 
fighting scouts with optimist is a plus
more<00:03:41.430> heavy<00:03:41.670> people<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.840> Warriors<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
more heavy people like the Warriors and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.460 
more heavy people like the Warriors and
the<00:03:43.590> commander's<00:03:44.250> not<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.470> feel

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
the commander's not so much I feel

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.620 
the commander's not so much I feel
ratchet<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.190> Ironhide<00:03:48.000> our<00:03:48.269> better

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
ratchet and Ironhide our better

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.569 
ratchet and Ironhide our better
commanders<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.650> optimism<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:50.250> game<00:03:50.430> which

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
commanders and optimism this game which

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.550 
commanders and optimism this game which
is<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.940> big<00:03:51.600> sad<00:03:51.810> face<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.049> me<00:03:52.290> because<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.530> a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
is a big sad face for me because I'm a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.729 
is a big sad face for me because I'm a
huge<00:03:52.799> fan<00:03:52.829> of<00:03:53.010> Optimus<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:55.019> think<00:03:55.440> their

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
huge fan of Optimus so I think their

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.490 
huge fan of Optimus so I think their
guns<00:03:56.010> are<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.730> lot<00:03:57.060> better<00:03:57.209> they're<00:03:57.600> effective

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
guns are a lot better they're effective

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.620 
guns are a lot better they're effective
from<00:03:58.650> both<00:03:58.860> long<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.160> close<00:03:59.820> range<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.360> their

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
from both long and close range and their

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.690 
from both long and close range and their
special<00:04:01.049> ability<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.860> heavy<00:04:02.100> irons<00:04:02.459> that

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
special ability like heavy irons that

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.009 
special ability like heavy irons that
thing<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:02.970> hairs<00:04:03.299> through<00:04:03.540> people<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:03.930> you

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
thing just hairs through people if you

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.300 
thing just hairs through people if you
have<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> couple<00:04:04.440> people<00:04:04.560> lined<00:04:04.890> up<00:04:05.100> and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
have a couple people lined up and

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.789 
have a couple people lined up and
ratchets<00:04:06.030> thermal<00:04:06.420> minds<00:04:06.660> are<00:04:07.350> awesome

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
ratchets thermal minds are awesome

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.990 
ratchets thermal minds are awesome
because<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.070> can<00:04:08.160> jump<00:04:08.489> back<00:04:08.610> lay<00:04:08.820> those<00:04:08.940> down

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
because you can jump back lay those down

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.580 
because you can jump back lay those down
and<00:04:09.390> get<00:04:09.510> protection<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.320> can<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
and get protection and you can get a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.920 
and get protection and you can get a
couple<00:04:11.070> fills<00:04:11.459> with<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.930> optimises

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
couple fills with that optimises

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.479 
couple fills with that optimises
shoulder<00:04:13.470> launcher<00:04:13.769> doesn't<00:04:14.130> last<00:04:14.250> too<00:04:14.400> long

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
shoulder launcher doesn't last too long

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.090 
shoulder launcher doesn't last too long
and<00:04:14.880> usually<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.049> only<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.470> pull<00:04:16.739> off<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:17.010> a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
and usually I only can pull off like a

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.610 
and usually I only can pull off like a
double<00:04:17.430> kill<00:04:17.640> with<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:19.320> i

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
double kill with it if that so i

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.130 
double kill with it if that so i
definitely<00:04:20.340> recommend<00:04:20.690> ratchet<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:21.840> iron

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
definitely recommend ratchet or iron

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.770 
definitely recommend ratchet or iron
hype<00:04:22.289> over<00:04:22.500> optimus<00:04:23.250> for

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
hype over optimus for

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.780 
hype over optimus for
then<00:04:25.110> overall<00:04:25.470> commander<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.190> feel<00:04:26.400> they're

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
then overall commander I feel they're

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.640 
then overall commander I feel they're
better<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:27.240> Optimus<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.660> all<00:04:27.900> right<00:04:28.110> he's<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
better but Optimus is all right he's a

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.140 
better but Optimus is all right he's a
little<00:04:28.889> bit<00:04:29.040> faster<00:04:29.370> than<00:04:29.490> Ironhide<00:04:29.880> he's

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
little bit faster than Ironhide he's

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.720 
little bit faster than Ironhide he's
probably<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.080> little<00:04:31.170> slower<00:04:31.560> than<00:04:31.770> ratchet<00:04:32.220> so

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
probably a little slower than ratchet so

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.480 
probably a little slower than ratchet so
I<00:04:32.760> personally<00:04:33.450> prefer<00:04:33.810> ratchet<00:04:34.410> full<00:04:34.650> for<00:04:35.280> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
I personally prefer ratchet full for the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.040 
I personally prefer ratchet full for the
