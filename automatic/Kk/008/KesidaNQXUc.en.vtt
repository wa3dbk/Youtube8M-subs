00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
rainbow colors now one of the things

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.890 
rainbow colors now one of the things
about<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.120> once<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.419> actually<00:04:48.690> make<00:04:48.870> a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
about it is once you actually make a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.220 
about it is once you actually make a
rainbow<00:04:49.140> color<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:51.150> can't<00:04:51.450> undo<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
rainbow color you can't undo it so you

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.440 
rainbow color you can't undo it so you
can't<00:04:52.380> take<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> play-doh<00:04:52.890> back<00:04:53.190> out<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.790> you

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
can't take the play-doh back out so you

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.700 
can't take the play-doh back out so you
will<00:04:54.630> probably<00:04:54.780> go<00:04:55.050> through<00:04:55.260> quite<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.470> bit<00:04:55.560> of

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
will probably go through quite a bit of

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.800 
will probably go through quite a bit of
play-doh<00:04:55.860> using<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.430> playset<00:04:56.850> but<00:04:57.660> other

play-doh using this playset but other
than<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.380> probably<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.950> five<00:04:59.130> star

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
than that it's probably a five star
