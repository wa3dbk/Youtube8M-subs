00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.880 

you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.270 

as<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.480> read<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.260> presents<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.980> much

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
as you have read the presents are much

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.760 
as you have read the presents are much
too<00:02:35.550> heavy<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.060> bring<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> sleigh<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.590> he

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
too heavy to bring on the sleigh so he

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.460 
too heavy to bring on the sleigh so he
grows<00:02:38.100> them<00:02:38.400> under<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> tree

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.140 

and<00:02:42.590> he<00:02:43.580> does<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.060> using<00:02:44.750> nanotechnology

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and he does this using nanotechnology

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.060 
and he does this using nanotechnology
historically<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.870> key<00:02:48.230> scientific

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
historically the key scientific

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.840 
historically the key scientific
achievement<00:02:49.640> was<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.120> learn<00:02:50.450> how<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.900> convert

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
achievement was to learn how to convert

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.330
