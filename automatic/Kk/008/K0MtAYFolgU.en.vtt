00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.529
 we see that perfection was going to say in 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.800
 search for happiness pressure declared 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.929

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.899
 you know that series in which he tried 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.410

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.870
 kill 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.090
 and if it can be without receiving me if 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.680
 It can be a host, I have not found a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.340
 night bar 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.940
 because that killed him because he wanted it 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.940

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.059

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.950
 40 trying to deny the idea 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.780
 Well, then there will not be 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.909

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.760
 and good when it must in question that no 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 I saw it 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.000
 when it takes about five or six minutes 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.810
 and to contribute to it because you 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.270
 so we tagged along even if they are those of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.270

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.270
 nose 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.180
 Tell you, let's see if he survives 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.290
 and that survives 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.920
 like the site this 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.920

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 die the two 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.879
 he says here in the game a few 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.010
 and will check out one 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.599
 that is the whore 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.510
 14 3 and good for those who did not see 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.980
 from the first chapter 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.629
 it's easy to understand 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.569
 I'm going to try to start the game 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:56.880
 perfect basically there is not much more 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.140
 to understand so I cheered up and such 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.450
 and the first the first chapter was in 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.130
 close quarters and you thought I was going to 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.730
 always play with a barracks if it is not 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.420
 so I'm going to go green because this is not 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.420
 pass 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.120
 I died 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.670
 this shit just when it's going to cover 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.190
 I shit on the whore 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.650
 kill what we had as soon as it was and 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.540
 man 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.540
 and it's downloaded all those days 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 Does not die 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.800
 and kills me not to another but writes 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.630
 us for ass fuck I try and 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.630
 he tries 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.890
 We have been five minutes already fast 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.369
 you do not know 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.409
 let's see why here I knew what 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.150
 I knew I killed you and you killed me and I revived 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.099
 Of course , I 'm given the fucking ass 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.750
 man to me that go for the fucking ass 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:22.460
 it is clear 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.560
 17 5 that will be 17 6 ​​I guess and good since 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.650
 you see that it is not for so much 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.210
 I think he was explaining something 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.460
 is explaining that many crises that 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.460
 I'm going to be even quarter alone and not 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.949
 all the maps you have 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.560
 basically not going to be not going to be 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.500
 I was born with the maps 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.389
 I just played the first chapter in 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.550
 club quarters and you told me it's not that 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.430
 even arts it is impossible to become 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.900
 perfect match yes yes yes yes I the 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.139
 perfect match that I have is even 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.930
 artistic I do not know I do not know you how 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.540
 you see it but I see it that it is 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.680
 possible 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.680
 die die 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.300

 that you liked the chapter this time 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:33.800

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:35.599
 to do is a perfect game I hope that 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.019

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.019
