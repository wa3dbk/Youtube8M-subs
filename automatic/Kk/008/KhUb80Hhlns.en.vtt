me try let me see what I can do so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.370 
me try let me see what I can do so
here's<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> told<00:00:24.660> him<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here's basically what I told him the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
here's basically what I told him the
first<00:00:25.560> thing<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> don't<00:00:26.310> overthink<00:00:26.970> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
first thing is don't overthink it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.029 
first thing is don't overthink it
people<00:00:27.840> tend<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:28.859> more

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
people tend to think it's a lot more

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.759 
people tend to think it's a lot more
complicated<00:00:29.460> than<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.769> really

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
complicated than it really is and really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
complicated than it really is and really
all<00:00:32.430> you're<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:32.850> trying<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> big

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
all you're really trying to do the big

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.990 
all you're really trying to do the big
concept<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.280> trying<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> piece

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
concept is you're trying to get a piece

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.840 
concept is you're trying to get a piece
of<00:00:36.210> radiant<00:00:36.780> barrier<00:00:37.110> foil<00:00:37.440> between<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.610> roof

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of radiant barrier foil between the roof

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
of radiant barrier foil between the roof
and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.570> attic<00:00:39.600> insulation<00:00:40.430> normally<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and the attic insulation normally that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
and the attic insulation normally that
roof<00:00:41.790> gets<00:00:42.030> hot<00:00:42.300> absorbs<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.170> radiant

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
roof gets hot absorbs all the radiant

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
roof gets hot absorbs all the radiant
heat<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> Sun<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> roof

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
heat from the Sun and then the roof

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.290 
heat from the Sun and then the roof
reradiates<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.590> heat<00:00:46.860> across<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.940> attic

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
reradiates that heat across the attic

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
reradiates that heat across the attic
space<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> heats<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> insulation

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
space and it heats up the insulation

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.660 
space and it heats up the insulation
this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> heat<00:00:51.360> transfer<00:00:51.600> by<00:00:52.070> non-contact<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is heat transfer by non-contact the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
this is heat transfer by non-contact the
whole<00:00:53.820> concept<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> radiant<00:00:54.930> barrier<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
whole concept of a radiant barrier is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.959 
whole concept of a radiant barrier is
you<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> piece<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> foil

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you want to get that piece of foil

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.520 
you want to get that piece of foil
between<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> roof<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> insulation

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
between the roof and the insulation

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
between the roof and the insulation
it's<00:00:59.039> breaking<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.910> path<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> reflecting

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's breaking that path and reflecting

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's breaking that path and reflecting
that<00:01:01.649> heat<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:02.239> ultimately<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.480> we're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that heat back ultimately what we're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.800 
that heat back ultimately what we're
trying<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.470> keep<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> insulation

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
trying to do is keep the insulation

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
trying to do is keep the insulation
cooler<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> next<00:01:08.189> thing<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> do

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
corresponding hole in the foil and you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120 
corresponding hole in the foil and you
don't<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.599> ridge<00:02:57.870> vent<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.799> for

don't have to have ridge vent for for
raining<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> barrier<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.760> work<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.840> air<00:03:01.140> that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
raining a barrier to work that air that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
raining a barrier to work that air that
hot<00:03:01.680> air<00:03:01.709> will<00:03:02.069> find<00:03:02.489> whatever<00:03:03.329> hole<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
hot air will find whatever hole is in

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.479 
hot air will find whatever hole is in
the<00:03:04.019> top<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.410> attic<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.310> really

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the top of the attic and it's really

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.640 
the top of the attic and it's really
that<00:03:05.640> simple<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.269> basically<00:03:06.690> you're<00:03:07.470> going<00:03:07.590> to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that simple so basically you're going to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.620 
that simple so basically you're going to
staple<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.160> up<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.849> get<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> piece<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.390> foil

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
staple it up you can get a piece of foil

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.110 
staple it up you can get a piece of foil
between<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.079> roof<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> insulation

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
between the roof and the insulation

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.250 
between the roof and the insulation
you're<00:03:12.120> going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.329> cover<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:12.810> much<00:03:13.019> as

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you're going to cover as much as
