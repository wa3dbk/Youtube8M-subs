00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that question

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.200 
that question
drop<00:02:16.770> me<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> message<00:02:17.160> or<00:02:17.640> leave<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
drop me a message or leave it in the

so<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.010> acknowledge<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:21.000> I'll<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.720> look

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
so we can acknowledge you I'll go look

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.750 
so we can acknowledge you I'll go look
at<00:02:22.020> my<00:02:22.170> messages<00:02:22.650> real<00:02:22.890> quick<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.640> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
at my messages real quick to see if it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.150 
at my messages real quick to see if it's
in<00:02:23.880> there<00:02:24.120> again<00:02:24.420> nope<00:02:24.870> not<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.380> there<00:02:25.590> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
in there again nope not in there so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.970 
in there again nope not in there so
anyway<00:02:26.550> asks<00:02:27.150> what<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.450> biggest<00:02:27.720> break

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
anyway asks what is the biggest break

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.140 
anyway asks what is the biggest break
and<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.310> tricky<00:02:29.970> question<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:32.150> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and that's a tricky question because it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.930 
and that's a tricky question because it
depends<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.630> what<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.380> criteria<00:02:34.620> yes<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> mean

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
depends on what your criteria yes I mean

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.060 
depends on what your criteria yes I mean
obviously<00:02:36.060> Legos<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> giant<00:02:37.710> break<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
obviously Legos got the giant break this

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.980 
obviously Legos got the giant break this
at<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.430> store<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.210> probably<00:02:39.690> some

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
at the store and there's probably some

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.630 
at the store and there's probably some
even<00:02:40.290> bigger<00:02:40.680> than<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.310> probably

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
even bigger than that but that probably

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
even bigger than that but that probably
doesn't<00:02:41.880> count<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.170> did<00:02:43.350> some<00:02:43.530> research<00:02:43.709> on

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
doesn't count and I did some research on

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.530 
doesn't count and I did some research on
some<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> various<00:02:45.300> Lego<00:02:45.630> websites<00:02:46.110> like

and<00:02:51.330> seems<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> lot<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> discussion<00:02:52.950> came<00:02:53.130> up

and seems to a lot of discussion came up

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.350 
and seems to a lot of discussion came up
about<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:54.000> big<00:02:54.510> base<00:02:54.989> plates<00:02:55.970> base<00:02:56.970> plates

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
about the big base plates base plates

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.190 
about the big base plates base plates
like<00:02:57.630> for<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.959> castle<00:02:58.350> sets<00:02:58.700> there<00:02:59.700> they're

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
like for the castle sets there they're

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.280 
like for the castle sets there they're
like<00:03:01.200> 32<00:03:02.010> by<00:03:02.400> 48<00:03:02.430> which<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.570> smaller<00:03:03.870> than<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
like 32 by 48 which is smaller than the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.160 
like 32 by 48 which is smaller than the
48<00:03:04.709> by<00:03:04.860> 48<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> 50<00:03:05.850> by<00:03:06.030> 50<00:03:06.420> base<00:03:06.630> plate<00:03:06.930> but

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
48 by 48 or the 50 by 50 base plate but

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.210 
48 by 48 or the 50 by 50 base plate but
it's<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.950> volume<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.470> area<00:03:10.850> volume<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:13.220> by

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
it's got volume so area volume so by

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.010 
it's got volume so area volume so by
volume<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:15.000> probably<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> bigger

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
volume that's probably one of the bigger

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.990 
volume that's probably one of the bigger
ones<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.709> one<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> biggest<00:03:17.520> one<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> got

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
ones this one is the biggest one I got

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.550 
ones this one is the biggest one I got
and<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.299> probably<00:03:21.840> technically<00:03:22.320> not<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and it's probably technically not a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.100 
and it's probably technically not a
piece<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> DUPLO<00:03:25.549> plate<00:03:26.549> or<00:03:27.060> brick<00:03:27.360> but

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
piece this is a DUPLO plate or brick but

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.070 
piece this is a DUPLO plate or brick but
it's<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.920> brick<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.670> really<00:03:30.390> for

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
it's really not a brick it's really for

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.500 
it's really not a brick it's really for
holding<00:03:31.560> bricks<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:33.030> kind<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.480> a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
holding bricks so it's kind of like a

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
holding bricks so it's kind of like a
base<00:03:33.840> plate<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.560> actually<00:03:34.890> designed<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
base plate but it's actually designed to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.060 
base plate but it's actually designed to
go<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> wall<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.200> connect<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
go on the wall and then you connect the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
go on the wall and then you connect the
pieces<00:03:38.280> that's<00:03:38.640> pretty<00:03:39.060> big<00:03:39.180> piece<00:03:41.090> that's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
pieces that's pretty big piece that's

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
pieces that's pretty big piece that's
from<00:03:42.410> 97<00:03:43.519> 35<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.880> think<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.239> can't<00:03:45.480> remember<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
from 97 35 I think I can't remember so

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.490 
from 97 35 I think I can't remember so
what<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.070> think<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> biggest<00:03:47.730> piece<00:03:48.000> I

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
what do you think is the biggest piece I

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.080 
what do you think is the biggest piece I
think<00:03:49.500> it's<00:03:49.650> probably<00:03:50.100> one<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.459> those<00:03:50.640> castle

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
think it's probably one of those castle

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.789 
think it's probably one of those castle
base<00:03:51.239> plates<00:03:51.570> or<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> one<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.320> was<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.680> in

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
base plates or the one that was like in

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.979 
base plates or the one that was like in
the<00:03:52.920> Indiana<00:03:53.190> Jones<00:03:53.549> said<00:03:53.970> that's<00:03:54.840> probably

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
the Indiana Jones said that's probably

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.900 
the Indiana Jones said that's probably
to<00:03:55.260> me<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.739> did<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> piece<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.580> was

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
to me that it did a piece that was

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.289 
to me that it did a piece that was
produced<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.450> an<00:03:57.600> actual<00:03:57.959> Lego<00:03:58.620> set<00:03:59.120> hello<00:04:00.120> if

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
produced in an actual Lego set hello if

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.490 
produced in an actual Lego set hello if
you<00:04:00.390> know<00:04:00.540> something<00:04:00.780> bigger<00:04:01.110> now<00:04:01.320> let's

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
you know something bigger now let's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.990 
you know something bigger now let's
don't<00:04:01.680> count<00:04:01.920> like<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.340> said<00:04:02.519> those<00:04:02.760> things

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
don't count like I said those things

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.720 
don't count like I said those things
they<00:04:03.480> put<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.989> stores<00:04:04.320> things<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.489> that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
they put in the stores things like that

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.020 
they put in the stores things like that
all<00:04:06.330> right<00:04:06.540> now<00:04:06.900> about<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.860> figure<00:04:08.700> out<00:04:08.790> what<00:04:08.910> my

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
all right now about I figure out what my

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.920 
all right now about I figure out what my
other<00:04:09.090> question<00:04:09.570> was<00:04:10.400> expensive<00:04:11.400> bricks<00:04:11.930> Sam

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
other question was expensive bricks Sam

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.500 
other question was expensive bricks Sam
I<00:04:13.170> asked<00:04:13.890> do<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> think<00:04:14.519> Lego<00:04:14.910> baseplates

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
I asked do you think Lego baseplates

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.800 
I asked do you think Lego baseplates
will<00:04:15.750> ever<00:04:16.019> get<00:04:16.680> cheap<00:04:17.220> they're<00:04:18.209> usually<00:04:18.419> what

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
will ever get cheap they're usually what

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.319 
will ever get cheap they're usually what
about<00:04:19.140> five<00:04:19.650> or<00:04:19.799> six<00:04:19.979> dollars<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
about five or six dollars and then the
