the air box if you look at the bottom of
the<00:00:29.789> air<00:00:29.910> box<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the air box you can see you have a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
the air box you can see you have a
little<00:00:32.250> socket<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:33.030> rubber<00:00:33.180> socket<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
little socket little rubber socket here

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
little socket little rubber socket here
and<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.920> those<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and here and those are just going to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
and here and those are just going to
poke<00:00:36.030> onto<00:00:36.360> these<00:00:36.480> pins<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.969> go<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
poke onto these pins and and go on the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100 
poke onto these pins and and go on the
hardest<00:00:40.980> part<00:00:41.219> maybe<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.570> people<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
hardest part maybe for some people is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.069 
hardest part maybe for some people is
this<00:00:43.410> drain<00:00:44.280> hose<00:00:44.489> I've<00:00:45.030> left<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.960> works

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
this drain hose I've left it on it works

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.580 
this drain hose I've left it on it works
fine<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:47.460> leave<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.539> you're<00:00:49.500> gonna

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fine to leave it on and you're gonna

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.819 
fine to leave it on and you're gonna
install<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> corner<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.649> not

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
install it down in the corner it's not

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
install it down in the corner it's not
connected<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> anything<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.539> drain

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
connected to anything it's just a drain

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
connected to anything it's just a drain
hose<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> worry<00:00:56.640> about

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hose so you don't have to worry about

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
hose so you don't have to worry about
connecting<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> there

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
connecting it down in there

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
connecting it down in there
so<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:58.739> thing<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.340> stick<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so first thing is you're gonna stick it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
so first thing is you're gonna stick it
down<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.210> hole<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.870> it'll<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
down in that hole and it'll just kind of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.750 
down in that hole and it'll just kind of
weave<00:01:01.829> itself<00:01:02.190> down<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.579> there<00:01:04.460> move<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> air

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
weave itself down in there move the air

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.679 
weave itself down in there move the air
box<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.510> place

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.870 

the<00:01:16.689> preheating<00:01:17.679> duck<00:01:17.890> needs<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.250> go<00:01:18.399> on<00:01:18.520> first

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
the preheating duck needs to go on first

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.649 
the preheating duck needs to go on first
because<00:01:19.390> it's<00:01:19.719> down<00:01:19.869> lowest<00:01:20.319> and<00:01:21.219> it's<00:01:21.429> not

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because it's down lowest and it's not

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.959 
because it's down lowest and it's not
super<00:01:22.659> easy<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:23.229> get<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.530> but<00:01:23.770> it's<00:01:23.920> it's<00:01:24.759> not

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
super easy to get on but it's it's not

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.699 
super easy to get on but it's it's not
too<00:01:25.179> hard<00:01:25.479> either<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:26.049> make<00:01:26.229> sure<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:26.530> on

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
too hard either just make sure it's on

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.499 
too hard either just make sure it's on
there<00:01:27.039> because<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.429> want<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.789> be<00:01:28.299> sucking

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
there because you want to be sucking

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.919 
there because you want to be sucking
warm<00:01:28.929> air<00:01:29.200> when<00:01:30.159> it's<00:01:30.280> cold<00:01:30.520> outside<00:01:30.810> from<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
warm air when it's cold outside from the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.969 
warm air when it's cold outside from the
exhaust<00:01:32.200> area<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:38.200> see<00:01:38.229> it's<00:01:38.590> down<00:01:38.799> in

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
exhaust area and you see it's down in

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
exhaust area and you see it's down in
there

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.350 

easier<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.320> reach<00:01:47.500> around<00:01:48.120> like<00:01:49.120> this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
easier to reach around like this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.810 
easier to reach around like this
underneath<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.260> mass<00:01:50.590> airflow<00:01:50.830> stuck<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.640> get

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
underneath the mass airflow stuck to get

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.290 
underneath the mass airflow stuck to get
the<00:01:52.000> preheat<00:01:52.600> air<00:01:52.840> on<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.370> install<00:01:54.760> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
the preheat air on then you install the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.800 
the preheat air on then you install the
mass<00:01:55.720> air<00:01:55.900> flow<00:01:55.960> sensor<00:01:56.650> duct<00:01:57.100> move<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.000> clamp

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
mass air flow sensor duct move the clamp

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.859 
mass air flow sensor duct move the clamp
back<00:01:59.110> into<00:01:59.410> position<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:01.450> are<00:02:01.660> some<00:02:01.840> very

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
back into position these are some very

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.350 
back into position these are some very
fancy<00:02:02.320> hose<00:02:02.770> clamp<00:02:03.100> pliers<00:02:03.340> not<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> lot<00:02:04.330> of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
fancy hose clamp pliers not a lot of

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.640 
fancy hose clamp pliers not a lot of
people<00:02:04.570> are<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:04.960> them<00:02:05.170> channel

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
people are going to have them channel

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.380 
people are going to have them channel
locks<00:02:05.860> or<00:02:06.130> vice<00:02:06.280> grips<00:02:06.550> work<00:02:06.790> okay

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
locks or vice grips work okay

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.139 
locks or vice grips work okay
and<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.229> I'm<00:02:08.530> just<00:02:08.709> going<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.860> re-release<00:02:09.640> this

just<00:03:20.840> want<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.080> insert<00:03:21.440> them<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.300> might

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
just want to insert them and it might

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.390 
just want to insert them and it might
take<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.900> couple<00:03:24.170> seconds<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.800> know<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.980> get<00:03:25.250> it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
take a couple seconds you know to get it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.690 
take a couple seconds you know to get it
where<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.209> supposed<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.570> go<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.830> take

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
where it's supposed to go you just take

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.850 
where it's supposed to go you just take
your<00:03:28.820> time<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:32.239> all<00:03:32.480> snap<00:03:32.840> together<00:03:33.140> this

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
your time and it all snap together this

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.070 
your time and it all snap together this
little<00:03:34.100> groove<00:03:34.400> right<00:03:34.820> here<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.870> these

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
little groove right here that these

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.530 
little groove right here that these
little<00:03:36.260> fingers<00:03:36.890> need<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.220> go<00:03:37.370> into<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
little fingers need to go into and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.780 
little fingers need to go into and
that's<00:03:38.720> correct<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.580> very<00:03:40.730> last

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that's correct and then the very last

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.840 
that's correct and then the very last
step<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:42.350> cover<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.220> whole<00:03:43.340> snorkel

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
step is the cover for the whole snorkel

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.090 
step is the cover for the whole snorkel
and<00:03:44.480> then<00:03:44.690> make<00:03:44.870> sure<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.320> haven't<00:03:45.560> left<00:03:45.860> any

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
and then make sure you haven't left any

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.820 
and then make sure you haven't left any
tools<00:03:46.519> in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.780> engine<00:03:48.110> bay<00:03:48.230> kind<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.680> do<00:03:48.799> a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
tools in the engine bay kind of do a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.380 
tools in the engine bay kind of do a
good<00:03:49.100> scan<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.790> have<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.970> left<00:03:50.209> neat

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
good scan that you have a left neat

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.070 
good scan that you have a left neat
thing<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.350> that's<00:03:51.500> pretty<00:03:51.680> much<00:03:51.860> it
