have to draw the body which is another
rectangular<00:00:39.180> prism<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.070> basically<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
rectangular prism and basically this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.240 
rectangular prism and basically this
whole<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> made<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> cubes<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.920> if

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
whole thing is made up of cubes so if

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
whole thing is made up of cubes so if
you<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> drug<00:00:44.820> cubes<00:00:45.149> then

you don't know the drug cubes then

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.130 
you don't know the drug cubes then
you're<00:00:45.930> screwed<00:00:46.050> basically<00:00:47.149> go<00:00:48.149> home<00:00:48.360> learn

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this stamp that stamps creepers and how

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.099 
this stamp that stamps creepers and how
you<00:00:54.690> made<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.170> went<00:00:55.530> slap<00:00:55.710> happy<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> but

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
you made I went slap happy with it but

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
you made I went slap happy with it but
yeah<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.100> cleaning<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> edges

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
yeah so now just cleaning up the edges

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.380 
yeah so now just cleaning up the edges
with<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.390> eraser<00:01:00.629> tool<00:01:01.910> if<00:01:02.910> you're<00:01:03.030> doing<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
with an eraser tool if you're doing this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
with an eraser tool if you're doing this
with<00:01:03.539> pencil<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.199> it'd<00:01:04.559> probably<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.920> easier

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
with pencil then it'd probably be easier

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
with pencil then it'd probably be easier
for<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.180> draw<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.720> box<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
if you're on the computer you can make a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719 
if you're on the computer you can make a
layer<00:01:22.259> underneath<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> transparent

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
layer underneath like a transparent

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
layer underneath like a transparent
layer<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.210> color<00:01:24.420> underneath<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
layer and just color underneath it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.819 
layer and just color underneath it
rejected<00:01:25.830> color<00:01:27.229> yeah<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.590> coloring

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
rejected color yeah now we're coloring

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.560 
rejected color yeah now we're coloring
it<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.240> understand

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it in also if you don't understand

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.039 
it in also if you don't understand
shading<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.860> should<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.280> home<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
shading then you should go home and

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
shading then you should go home and
they're<00:01:34.049> shady<00:01:34.340> basically<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> top
