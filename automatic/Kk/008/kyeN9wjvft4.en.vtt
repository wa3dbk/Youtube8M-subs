very good for fish and so yeah I just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.069 
very good for fish and so yeah I just
merely<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.280> feed<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> fish<00:00:54.079> every

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
merely use this I feed the fish every

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.729 
merely use this I feed the fish every
two<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.469> three<00:00:55.500> days<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:57.379> loads<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> people

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
two or three days and loads of people

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.720 
two or three days and loads of people
like<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.460> feed<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> fish<00:01:00.050> every<00:01:01.050> single<00:01:01.260> day

like to feed the fish every single day

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.070 
like to feed the fish every single day
but<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> find<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.809> necessary<00:01:04.970> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
but I find it's not really necessary and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.649 
but I find it's not really necessary and
it's<00:01:07.080> also<00:01:07.260> good<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.030> give<00:01:09.030> them<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> break

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's also good if you give them a break

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's also good if you give them a break
one<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.260> days<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> week<00:01:10.909> just<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> let<00:01:12.240> the

like<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> give<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> auto<00:01:33.119> catfish<00:01:33.780> some<00:01:34.200> algae

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
like to give the auto catfish some algae

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.760 
like to give the auto catfish some algae
with<00:01:35.189> us<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.670> catfish<00:01:36.180> pellets<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.409> basically

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
with us or catfish pellets but basically

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
with us or catfish pellets but basically
the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.630> made<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> algae<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.470> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the same thing made of algae but in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.630 
the same thing made of algae but in
different<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:42.470> forms<00:01:43.470> these<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.189> discs

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
different kind of forms these are discs

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.569 
different kind of forms these are discs
and<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.659> pellets<00:01:46.189> these<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> lot

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and these are pellets these are a lot

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
and these are pellets these are a lot
better<00:01:47.700> fella<00:01:48.030> Cory<00:01:48.329> cats<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:48.990> they're

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
better fella Cory cats because they're

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.700 
better fella Cory cats because they're
in<00:01:49.380> pellet<00:01:49.740> form<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.549> easier<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> eat

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
in pellet form and the easier to eat

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.840 
in pellet form and the easier to eat
whereas<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.159> better<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> auto

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
whereas these are better for the auto

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600 
whereas these are better for the auto
catfish<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.860> just<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.280> gives<00:01:56.430> them

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
catfish and just so it gives them

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
catfish and just so it gives them

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
Tennyson from the Klingon new and the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.899 
Tennyson from the Klingon new and the
shrimp's<00:01:59.969> also<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.899> pellets<00:02:01.759> because<00:02:02.759> what

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
shrimp's also like pellets because what

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.420 
shrimp's also like pellets because what
the<00:02:03.000> shrimps<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> usually<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.250> give

my<00:02:37.350> experience<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.370> don't<00:02:39.209> think<00:02:39.480> fish<00:02:39.810> really

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
my experience I don't think fish really

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.340

like<00:02:40.410> freeze<00:02:41.070> dried<00:02:41.310> food<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.750> think<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
like freeze dried food I don't think it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.670 
like freeze dried food I don't think it
tastes<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.800> good<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.010> frozen<00:02:44.819> foods<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> i

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
tastes as good as frozen foods so i

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
tastes as good as frozen foods so i
don't<00:02:46.890> really<00:02:47.010> feed<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.459> much<00:02:47.700> maybe<00:02:48.030> once<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
don't really feed this much maybe once a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.830 
don't really feed this much maybe once a
month<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.550> prefer<00:02:50.840> frozen

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
month the really do prefer frozen

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.130 
month the really do prefer frozen
bloodworms<00:02:52.050> as<00:02:52.709> opposed<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> freeze-dried

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
bloodworms as opposed the freeze-dried

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.259 
bloodworms as opposed the freeze-dried
because<00:02:55.140> these<00:02:55.320> are<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.680> kind<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.269> crispy

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269

just when I'm not trying to breed them
I'll<00:04:06.480> feed<00:04:07.470> these<00:04:07.910> probably<00:04:08.910> four<00:04:09.150> times<00:04:09.299> a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I'll feed these probably four times a

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.509 
I'll feed these probably four times a
month<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.459> basically<00:04:11.850> weekly<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.510> suppose<00:04:13.519> one

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
month so basically weekly I suppose one

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.920 
month so basically weekly I suppose one
of<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.700> things<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.000> like<00:04:15.390> about<00:04:15.450> frozen

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
of the things I really like about frozen

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.750 
of the things I really like about frozen
foods<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.709> how<00:04:16.919> long<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.220> keep<00:04:17.370> them

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
foods is how long you can keep them

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.289 
foods is how long you can keep them
these<00:04:18.720> both<00:04:18.989> expire<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.769> 2014<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.090> means

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
these both expire in 2014 so that means

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.839 
these both expire in 2014 so that means
I've<00:04:21.450> got<00:04:21.479> another<00:04:21.780> two<00:04:22.049> years<00:04:22.260> out<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.530> them

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
I've got another two years out of them

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.379 
I've got another two years out of them
the<00:04:23.849> very<00:04:24.090> inexpensive<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.169> there's<00:04:26.160> also

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
the very inexpensive and there's also

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.219 
the very inexpensive and there's also
a<00:04:27.449> small<00:04:27.990> risk<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:29.509> disease<00:04:30.509> with<00:04:30.749> these<00:04:30.960> as

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
a small risk of disease with these as

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.580 
a small risk of disease with these as
opposed<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.099> live<00:04:32.280> foods<00:04:33.199> found<00:04:34.199> when<00:04:34.379> I<00:04:34.409> was

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
opposed to live foods found when I was

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.010 
opposed to live foods found when I was
feeding<00:04:34.800> my<00:04:34.889> fish<00:04:34.979> live<00:04:35.370> foods<00:04:35.840> they<00:04:36.840> get

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
feeding my fish live foods they get

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.529 
feeding my fish live foods they get
diseases<00:04:37.379> quite<00:04:37.770> often<00:04:38.009> and<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:39.180> was<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.419> a

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
diseases quite often and that was just a

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.390 
diseases quite often and that was just a
really<00:04:39.719> bad<00:04:39.840> supplier<00:04:40.409> so<00:04:40.830> if<00:04:40.919> you've<00:04:41.069> got<00:04:41.129> any

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
really bad supplier so if you've got any

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.339 
really bad supplier so if you've got any
doubts<00:04:41.669> about<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.120> supplier<00:04:42.479> of<00:04:42.779> your<00:04:43.169> live

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
doubts about the supplier of your live

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.670 
doubts about the supplier of your live
foods<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.099> I<00:04:44.849> just<00:04:45.360> get<00:04:45.629> frozen<00:04:46.319> foods

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
foods and I just get frozen foods

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.950 
foods and I just get frozen foods
because<00:04:46.949> there's<00:04:47.189> a<00:04:47.999> lot<00:04:48.060> less<00:04:48.930> risk<00:04:49.229> involved

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
because there's a lot less risk involved

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.989 
because there's a lot less risk involved
even<00:04:51.960> if<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.169> was<00:04:52.289> parasites<00:04:52.949> or<00:04:53.159> bacteria<00:04:53.849> in

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:53.999 
even if it was parasites or bacteria in

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.820 
even if it was parasites or bacteria in
them<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.360> probably<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.139> killed<00:04:55.409> when<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
them I probably be killed when the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.010 
them I probably be killed when the
frozen<00:04:56.389> because<00:04:57.389> these<00:04:57.569> are<00:04:57.749> flash<00:04:57.990> frozen

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
frozen because these are flash frozen

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.059 
frozen because these are flash frozen
which<00:04:58.620> means<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.639> only<00:04:59.909> takes<00:05:00.409> a<00:05:01.409> matter<00:05:01.889> of

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
which means it only takes a matter of

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.140 
which means it only takes a matter of
minutes<00:05:02.340> fun<00:05:02.969> to<00:05:03.150> be<00:05:03.180> frozen<00:05:04.759> so<00:05:05.759> yeah<00:05:05.939> I

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
minutes fun to be frozen so yeah I

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.260 
minutes fun to be frozen so yeah I
really<00:05:06.599> like<00:05:06.830> frozen<00:05:07.830> foods<00:05:08.219> it's<00:05:08.909> got<00:05:09.060> all

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
really like frozen foods it's got all

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.939 
really like frozen foods it's got all
the<00:05:09.300> nutrition<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.620> live<00:05:10.830> food<00:05:11.159> gives

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
the nutrition in that live food gives

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.469 
the nutrition in that live food gives
but<00:05:13.949> there's<00:05:14.129> less<00:05:14.310> risk<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.819> that<00:05:15.210> likely

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
but there's less risk of that likely

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.939 
but there's less risk of that likely
