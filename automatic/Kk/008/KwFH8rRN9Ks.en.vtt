00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.700

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.550 
emotional mental health and guards guard
the<00:03:02.700> pack<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.239> patrol<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> territory<00:03:06.560> that's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the pack and patrol the territory that's

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.780 
the pack and patrol the territory that's
basically<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
basically it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.530 
basically it
it's<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:10.760> mean<00:03:12.739> they're<00:03:13.790> they're<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
it's just I mean they're they're like in

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.059 
it's just I mean they're they're like in
charge<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.680> making<00:03:16.859> sure<00:03:17.870> there's<00:03:18.870> no<00:03:19.380> like

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
charge of making sure there's no like

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.379 
charge of making sure there's no like
trouble<00:03:20.700> nearby<00:03:21.030> or<00:03:21.090> ever

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.490 

some<00:03:25.290> people<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:26.840> warriors<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.170> their<00:03:28.260> back

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
some people have warriors in their back

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.349 
some people have warriors in their back
but<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.269> think<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.540> almost<00:03:31.639> like<00:03:32.639> the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
but I like to think that almost like the

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.449 
but I like to think that almost like the
whole<00:03:33.540> pack<00:03:33.810> except<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> pups<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.980> omegas

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
whole pack except for the pups in omegas

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.750 
whole pack except for the pups in omegas
would<00:03:36.180> fight<00:03:36.450> which<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.049> pretty<00:03:37.350> realistic<00:03:37.760> if

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
would fight which is pretty realistic if

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.960 
would fight which is pretty realistic if
there<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.329> standard<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.400> next<00:03:41.700> is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
there was standard and then next is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.599 
there was standard and then next is
Scouts<00:03:42.389> they<00:03:42.900> warn<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.500> pack<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.889> danger<00:03:44.370> and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
Scouts they warn the pack of danger and

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.330 
Scouts they warn the pack of danger and
visit<00:03:45.569> other<00:03:45.690> packs<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.470> they're<00:03:47.130> basically

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
visit other packs and they're basically

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.370 
visit other packs and they're basically
messengers<00:03:48.349> I<00:03:49.349> don't<00:03:49.920> get<00:03:50.040> many<00:03:50.220> Scouts

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
messengers I don't get many Scouts

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.650 
messengers I don't get many Scouts
whenever<00:03:52.380> or<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.519> my<00:03:54.000> last

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660

I<00:03:54.720> didn't<00:03:55.080> get<00:03:55.710> very<00:03:55.770> many<00:03:56.100> Scouts<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.360> don't

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
I didn't get very many Scouts I don't

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.880 
I didn't get very many Scouts I don't

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
I did have one once but then she left

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.000 
I did have one once but then she left
and<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> yeah<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.960> a<00:04:07.050> very<00:04:07.080> it's<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:07.830> a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
and so yeah it's a very it's it's a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.620 
and so yeah it's a very it's it's a
small<00:04:08.310> rink<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.910> still<00:04:09.180> pretty

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
small rink but it's still pretty

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.810 
small rink but it's still pretty
important<00:04:12.050> it's<00:04:13.050> not<00:04:13.260> required<00:04:13.710> but<00:04:14.280> it's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
important it's not required but it's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.840 
important it's not required but it's
always<00:04:15.030> nice<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:16.100> then<00:04:17.100> there<00:04:17.250> are<00:04:17.280> gammas

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
always nice and then there are gammas

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.850 
always nice and then there are gammas
which<00:04:18.120> are<00:04:18.269> basically<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.750> normal<00:04:19.530> wolves

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
which are basically just normal wolves

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.100 
which are basically just normal wolves
with<00:04:20.160> no<00:04:20.310> real<00:04:20.519> duty<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> guard<00:04:21.900> or<00:04:22.049> a

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
with no real duty like a guard or a

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.180 
with no real duty like a guard or a
healer<00:04:23.360> or<00:04:24.360> they<00:04:24.990> can<00:04:25.170> be<00:04:25.290> was<00:04:25.590> waiting<00:04:25.950> for<00:04:26.130> a

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
healer or they can be was waiting for a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.450 
healer or they can be was waiting for a
rink<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.550> will<00:04:26.880> suit<00:04:27.090> them<00:04:27.270> better<00:04:27.510> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
rink that will suit them better and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.380 
rink that will suit them better and
gammas<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.640> pretty<00:04:29.790> much<00:04:29.880> help<00:04:30.180> out<00:04:30.240> with

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
gammas can pretty much help out with

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.590 
gammas can pretty much help out with
anything<00:04:30.660> including<00:04:31.440> watching<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> pups

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
anything including watching the pups

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.210 
anything including watching the pups
they<00:04:33.600> just<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:34.080> no<00:04:34.260> real<00:04:34.440> job<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.770> guess<00:04:35.010> it's

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
they just have no real job I guess it's

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.310 
they just have no real job I guess it's
just<00:04:35.310> like<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.290> normal<00:04:37.560> wolf<00:04:37.860> like<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
just like it's just normal wolf like and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.560 
just like it's just normal wolf like and
then<00:04:40.800> there's<00:04:41.160> pups<00:04:41.400> unranked<00:04:42.090> children<00:04:42.480> of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
then there's pups unranked children of

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.820 
then there's pups unranked children of
the<00:04:42.630> pack<00:04:42.840> don't<00:04:43.170> need<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.410> really<00:04:43.620> explain

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the pack don't need to really explain

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.600 
the pack don't need to really explain
that<00:04:44.040> one<00:04:44.250> um<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.390> usually<00:04:45.830> if<00:04:46.830> there's<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.400> kid

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that one um I usually if there's a kid

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.950 
that one um I usually if there's a kid
like<00:04:48.000> maybe<00:04:48.320> 11<00:04:49.320> or<00:04:49.470> 12<00:04:49.740> or<00:04:50.040> younger<00:04:50.960> that

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
like maybe 11 or 12 or younger that

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.750 
like maybe 11 or 12 or younger that
joined<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.800> pack<00:04:52.980> then<00:04:53.280> they'd<00:04:53.490> be

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
joined the pack then they'd be

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.610 
joined the pack then they'd be
considered<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.360> pups<00:04:54.600> they<00:04:54.840> they<00:04:55.230> couldn't<00:04:55.440> be

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
considered to pups they they couldn't be

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.710
