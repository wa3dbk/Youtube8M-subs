00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.289 
I'll be showing you how to make your
piston<00:00:04.589> life<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.549> what<00:00:05.670> I'm<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.089> here

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
piston life so what I'm going to do here

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.450 
piston life so what I'm going to do here
is<00:00:06.330> just<00:00:06.390> cover<00:00:06.779> up<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.250> no

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
is just cover up for that so that no

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.520 
is just cover up for that so that no
light<00:00:08.639> gets<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.120> just<00:00:09.389> show<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.019> full<00:00:10.200> effect

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
light gets and just show the full effect

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.160 
light gets and just show the full effect
of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> light<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.820> alright<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.690> up<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
of the light it's alright it's up and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.420 
of the light it's alright it's up and
down<00:00:14.660> nice<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.690> simple<00:00:16.020> ways<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> tour<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
down nice and simple ways to tour it's a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.060 
down nice and simple ways to tour it's a
really<00:00:17.699> quick<00:00:18.029> tutorial<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.230> think<00:00:19.949> it's

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
really quick tutorial and I think it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.980 
really quick tutorial and I think it's
really<00:00:20.430> easy<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> make<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.510> let's<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.840> started

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
really easy to make so let's get started

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.929 
really easy to make so let's get started
it's<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.070> thing<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.730> is

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it's the first thing you want to do is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.540 
it's the first thing you want to do is
actually<00:00:24.119> build<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:25.350> outside<00:00:25.550> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
actually build your thing outside and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.609 
actually build your thing outside and
once<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.060> built<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.750> shove<00:00:28.439> some

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
once you built that just shove some

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
once you built that just shove some
stairs<00:00:28.859> gun<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> top<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.179> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
stairs gun up to the top so you can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.740 
stairs gun up to the top so you can
actually<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.800> get<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.369> easily<00:00:32.750> after

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
actually make get up really easily after

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.770 
actually make get up really easily after
this<00:00:33.899> come<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:35.030> shove<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.239> button<00:00:36.630> on

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this come to the back shove a button on

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
this come to the back shove a button on
it<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.680> testing<00:00:38.219> purposes

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it this is just for testing purposes

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
it this is just for testing purposes
only<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.170> don't<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> do

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
only so if you really don't want to do

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
only so if you really don't want to do
this<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.550> shove<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> torch<00:00:42.780> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
this you don't have to shove a torch on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
this you don't have to shove a torch on
the<00:00:43.140> top<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.520> torch

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the top so as you can see the torch

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
the top so as you can see the torch
turns<00:00:45.000> off<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.690> does<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:45.989> its<00:00:46.110> needs

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
turns off and then does what its needs

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.279 
turns off and then does what its needs
to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.550> next<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.730> need<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.050> space

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to do next we need to do is go one space

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.670 
to do next we need to do is go one space
forward<00:00:49.640> leave<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> gap<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.469> take<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
forward leave a gap and take out the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
forward leave a gap and take out the
block<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> place

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
block now this is going to be the place

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.380 
block now this is going to be the place
where<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.260> light<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> after

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
where you can have your light so after

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
where you can have your light so after
this<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> shove<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.649> normal<00:00:59.250> pistons

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this you want to shove to normal pistons

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
this you want to shove to normal pistons
on<00:01:00.000> either<00:01:00.449> side<00:01:02.239> like<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:06.600> build<00:01:06.750> up

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on either side like so and just build up

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.820 
on either side like so and just build up
to<00:01:07.350> dirt<00:01:07.680> blocks<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:09.350> these<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.560> gonna

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to dirt blocks here these are just gonna

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
to dirt blocks here these are just gonna
be<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.189> stand<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.610> stick<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.000> sticky

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
be a little stand to stick your sticky

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.640 
be a little stand to stick your sticky
piston<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> stick<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> sticky<00:01:15.990> piston<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
piston on so stick a sticky piston on it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.270 
piston on so stick a sticky piston on it
and<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.939> normal<00:01:17.939> block<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:19.470> should<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.770> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and a normal block and it should be one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
and a normal block and it should be one
above<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> gonna<00:01:21.270> push<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> down

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
above because it's gonna push it down

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.179 
above because it's gonna push it down
normally<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.920> extend<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:25.439> basically<00:01:25.950> come

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
normally and extend so basically come

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.819 
normally and extend so basically come
back<00:01:26.400> round<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> side<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:30.439> get<00:01:31.439> rid<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.650> those

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
back round the side and get rid of those

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.530 
back round the side and get rid of those
two<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:34.040> build<00:01:35.040> two<00:01:35.400> dirt<00:01:35.670> blocks<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.210> top<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
two and build two dirt blocks on top of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.390 
two and build two dirt blocks on top of
this<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> connect<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this and this is going to connect this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.749 
this and this is going to connect this
sticky<00:01:38.850> piston<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.810> George<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.520> run<00:01:44.520> two

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sticky piston to this George and run two

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.490 
sticky piston to this George and run two
pieces<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> redstone<00:01:45.450> stuff<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.320> coffee

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
pieces of redstone stuff and coffee

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.289 
pieces of redstone stuff and coffee
after<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.790> come

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
down the side stick two blocks there one

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.469 
down the side stick two blocks there one
block<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.780> come<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> other<00:01:55.950> side<00:01:57.649> 111

block there come the other side 111
repeat<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.719> each<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.380> free<00:02:01.740> tix

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
repeat your on each side on free tix

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.649 
repeat your on each side on free tix
each<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> same<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> other<00:02:04.860> side<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
your piston so it doesn't expose meant

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.240 
your piston so it doesn't expose meant
to<00:02:47.629> do<00:02:47.780> Connie<00:02:47.989> moma<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:48.349> stick<00:02:48.890> your<00:02:48.920> torch

on top and that's all it is so that's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.129 
on top and that's all it is so that's
all<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.370> circuit<00:02:52.790> pretty<00:02:53.120> much<00:02:53.299> done<00:02:53.569> so

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
all of a circuit pretty much done so

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.300 
all of a circuit pretty much done so
you're<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.590> now<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.769> test<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.220> out

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
you're going to do now is test it out

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.729 
you're going to do now is test it out
with<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.519> button<00:02:55.849> we've<00:02:55.970> tried<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:57.590> it

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
with this button we've tried and if it

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.360 
with this button we've tried and if it
does<00:02:57.889> that<00:02:58.129> then<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.389> know<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.659> working<00:03:00.370> so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
does that then you know it's working so

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.740 
does that then you know it's working so
after<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.269> just<00:03:02.329> want<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.599> get<00:03:02.690> rid

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
after this you just want to get rid

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.020 
after this you just want to get rid
button<00:03:03.349> go<00:03:04.129> one<00:03:04.489> block<00:03:04.700> below<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.450> block<00:03:05.750> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
button go one block below this block and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.430 
button go one block below this block and
build<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.690> whether<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.049> built<00:03:09.349> with

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
build out to whether I built with

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.110 
build out to whether I built with
staircase<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.639> is<00:03:10.700> going<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:11.000> wait

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
staircase now this is going to wait

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
staircase now this is going to wait
you're<00:03:11.269> running<00:03:11.599> redstone<00:03:12.019> too<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.950> I'm<00:03:13.069> going

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
you're running redstone too so I'm going

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:24.550 
you're running redstone too so I'm going
to<00:03:13.280> have<00:03:13.400> my<00:03:13.519> button<00:03:13.819> on<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.359> will

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.830 

and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.520> just<00:03:25.700> come<00:03:25.910> down<00:03:26.060> here<00:03:26.330> run<00:03:26.660> some

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and then just come down here run some

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.540 
and then just come down here run some
redstone<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.709> where<00:03:28.040> your<00:03:28.190> button<00:03:28.459> is

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
redstone so this is where your button is

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.850 
redstone so this is where your button is
going<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> be<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> bottom<00:03:29.330> block<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:30.709> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
going to be on the bottom block but you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.440 
going to be on the bottom block but you
can<00:03:31.099> move<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.430> about<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.150> need<00:03:32.300> to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
can move it about you just need to

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.850 
can move it about you just need to
extend<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.230> redstone<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.709> bit<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.410> run<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
extend the redstone a bit so run the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.270 
extend the redstone a bit so run the
redstone<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.550> way<00:03:37.640> along<00:03:39.010> but<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
redstone all the way along but on the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.800 
redstone all the way along but on the
last<00:03:40.459> block<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.970> need<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.269> stick<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> repeat

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
last block you need to stick a repeat

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.390 
last block you need to stick a repeat
yeah<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.230> don't<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.620> put<00:03:42.739> any<00:03:42.920> tips<00:03:43.220> on

it or anything you just stick a repeater

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.400 
it or anything you just stick a repeater
there<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.890> should<00:03:46.190> turn<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.910> torch<00:03:47.569> off

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410
