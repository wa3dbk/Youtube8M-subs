00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.679 

I<00:00:00.589> heard<00:00:01.589> about<00:00:01.860> jubileus<00:00:02.460> years<00:00:02.760> ago<00:00:03.149> but<00:00:03.540> it

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I heard about jubileus years ago but it

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.690 
I heard about jubileus years ago but it
sounded<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.110> bit<00:00:04.140> technical<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.339> bit<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.640> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
sounded a bit technical and a bit of a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.750 
sounded a bit technical and a bit of a
gimmick<00:00:05.940> but<00:00:06.390> like<00:00:07.319> anyone<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.859> hate<00:00:08.130> punctures

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
gimmick but like anyone I hate punctures

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.000 
gimmick but like anyone I hate punctures
so<00:00:09.330> initially<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> was<00:00:10.290> using<00:00:10.500> ultra

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
so initially I was using ultra

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400 
so initially I was using ultra
heavy-duty<00:00:11.460> tubes<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.780> reduce<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
heavy-duty tubes to try and reduce the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.189 
heavy-duty tubes to try and reduce the
number<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.769> trackside<00:00:14.340> repairs<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.990> our

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
number of trackside repairs and as our

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.470 
number of trackside repairs and as our
writing<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:16.859> technical<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.730> into<00:00:18.060> even

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
writing got more technical and into even

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080 
writing got more technical and into even
rockier<00:00:18.690> terrain<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.560> swapped<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.550> mooses

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
rockier terrain I swapped over to mooses

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
rockier terrain I swapped over to mooses
which<00:00:21.689> were<00:00:21.930> great<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.710> avoiding<00:00:23.160> punctures

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
which were great for avoiding punctures

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.660 
which were great for avoiding punctures
and<00:00:23.670> rim<00:00:24.029> damage<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:25.260> I've<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> admit<00:00:26.490> I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and rim damage but I've got to admit I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.939 
and rim damage but I've got to admit I
wasn't<00:00:26.880> wrapped<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> maintenance<00:00:27.949> fast

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
wasn't wrapped with the maintenance fast

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.740 
wasn't wrapped with the maintenance fast
weird<00:00:29.460> weight<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.689> cost<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.099> Moose's<00:00:32.750> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
weird weight and cost of the Moose's so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
weird weight and cost of the Moose's so
I<00:00:33.780> did<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> pile<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> research<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> tubeless

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I did a pile of research on the tubeless

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.150 
I did a pile of research on the tubeless
and<00:00:36.000> decided<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> crack<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.950> have

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and decided to have a crack they have

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.979 
and decided to have a crack they have
been<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.820> few<00:00:38.969> years<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.840> there

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
been out for a few years now so there

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
been out for a few years now so there
was<00:00:40.079> plenty<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.530> positive<00:00:41.129> feedback<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.969> the

following instructions when fitting and

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
following instructions when fitting and
apparently<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> few<00:00:52.710> minor<00:00:53.190> issues<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:54.030> the

apparently a few minor issues with the

apparently a few minor issues with the
original<00:00:54.660> tubeless<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.890> mined<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
original tubeless but mined out with the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.920 
original tubeless but mined out with the
current<00:00:57.270> second<00:00:57.780> generation<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.460> fitting<00:01:00.149> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
current second generation so fitting I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
current second generation so fitting I'm
a<00:01:00.989> complete<00:01:01.649> Gumby<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> comes<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> all

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a complete Gumby when it comes to all

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660 
a complete Gumby when it comes to all
things<00:01:03.480> mechanical<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.619> fitting<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.250> quite

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
things mechanical but fitting was quite

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
things mechanical but fitting was quite
straightforward<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.750> made<00:01:07.350> sure<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> follow<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
straightforward I made sure I follow the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
straightforward I made sure I follow the
instructions<00:01:08.729> precisely<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.110> reckon<00:01:10.409> next

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
instructions precisely and I reckon next

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
instructions precisely and I reckon next
time<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.729> won't<00:01:12.090> take<00:01:12.330> much<00:01:12.540> longer<00:01:12.930> or

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
time around it won't take much longer or

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710 
time around it won't take much longer or
be<00:01:13.500> any<00:01:13.920> trickier<00:01:14.460> than<00:01:14.520> fitting<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> tube<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
be any trickier than fitting a tube you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.230 
be any trickier than fitting a tube you
can<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.680> use<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> soapy<00:01:17.610> water<00:01:17.640> when

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
can just use a bit of soapy water when

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.539 
can just use a bit of soapy water when
fitting<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> sure<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.009> used<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.400> bit

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
fitting but just to be sure I used a bit

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
fitting but just to be sure I used a bit
of<00:01:20.670> slime<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.450> she<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.140> good<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> go

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
of slime and she was all good to go

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.820 
of slime and she was all good to go
I've<00:01:23.580> only<00:01:24.000> got<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> rear<00:01:24.630> tubeless<00:01:25.380> fitted

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I've only got the rear tubeless fitted

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
I've only got the rear tubeless fitted
as<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.250> wanted<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> few<00:01:27.119> rides<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.020> make

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as I wanted to do a few rides and make

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
down to around 40 s I gotta love that so

down to around 40 s I gotta love that so
far<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.150> looks<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.540> an<00:02:35.720> awesome<00:02:36.320> setup<00:02:36.650> so

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

I<00:02:37.550> sucked<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.060> tubeless<00:02:38.390> stickers<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
I sucked the tubeless stickers on the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.410 
I sucked the tubeless stickers on the
rim<00:02:39.560> which<00:02:40.100> incidentally<00:02:40.850> are<00:02:41.060> thick<00:02:41.390> enough

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
rim which incidentally are thick enough

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.110 
rim which incidentally are thick enough
to<00:02:41.720> predict<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.380> rims<00:02:42.680> from<00:02:42.980> scratches<00:02:43.670> so

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
to predict the rims from scratches so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.530 
to predict the rims from scratches so
might<00:02:44.360> even<00:02:44.630> order<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> few<00:02:45.140> more<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.590> those<00:02:46.540> so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
might even order a few more of those so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.690 
might even order a few more of those so
now<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:48.080> ordering<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> front<00:02:48.890> tubeless<00:02:49.400> -

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
now I'm ordering the front tubeless -

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.030 
now I'm ordering the front tubeless -
and<00:02:50.180> we'll<00:02:50.330> do<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> more<00:02:50.780> comprehensive<00:02:51.230> review

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
and we'll do a more comprehensive review

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.940 
and we'll do a more comprehensive review
after<00:02:52.730> some<00:02:52.910> good<00:02:53.120> solid<00:02:53.630> riding<00:02:54.050> on<00:02:54.170> both<00:02:54.440> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
after some good solid riding on both to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.680 
after some good solid riding on both to
see<00:02:55.130> if<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.520> find<00:02:55.700> any<00:02:55.970> downside<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
see if I can find any downside to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.730 
see if I can find any downside to
running<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.770> tubular<00:02:58.130> system
