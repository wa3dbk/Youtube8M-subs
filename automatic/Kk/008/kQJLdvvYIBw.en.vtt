how much the original wig cost so if you

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.860 
how much the original wig cost so if you
are<00:05:39.000> curious<00:05:41.039> how<00:05:42.039> much<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.520> original<00:05:43.030> hair

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
does cost on its own so I ended up with

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.810 
does cost on its own so I ended up with

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.990 
that 400 something the wig is originally
399<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:50.680> that's<00:05:51.190> how<00:05:51.340> much<00:05:51.460> it<00:05:51.639> costs<00:05:51.909> without
