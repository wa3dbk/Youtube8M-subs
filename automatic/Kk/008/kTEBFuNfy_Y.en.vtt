 Hi guys, this is SUNSfan with a preview of Nightstalker. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.900
 Nightstalker is a force carry hero who can dominate the game if he has a good start. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Also, as you can see, it may seem limited during the day. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Nightstalker's first skill is Void, a single-objective ability 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.500
 that at level 4 makes 335 damage, the attack speed decreases by 35% and the movement speed by 50%. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 This lasts 4 seconds in the night and 2 in the day. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 He also notes that he will apply a ministun to the contact, so no one will try to transport himself to escape. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.500
 The second skill of Nightstalker is Crippling Fear. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 It is also a single target ability, but it silences the enemy for 8 seconds 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 and it causes 40% of its attacks to fail. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 During the day the effects are greatly diminished. 40% becomes 10% and 8 seconds becomes 3. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 The third skill of Nightstalker is called Hunter in the Night 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 and it is a passive ability that makes it very powerful during the night. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.900
 Passively, you will gain 35% at the speed of movement and 75% at attack speed 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 steadily during the night. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Now one of the most unique mechanics of the game, the ultimate in Nightstalker, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
 Darkness, combines well with all his skills in a very obvious way. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 When used, it transforms the entire map at night for 80 seconds at level 3. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 Keep in mind that this ability stops the "hour", which is important 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 for if it is used at night, it prolongs it. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Obviously, you use it most times in the night, and in the day only to escape or help the team. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.800
 Nightstalker can also use Aghanim's Scepter, which is often done at a competitive level. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.100
 Aghanim's Scepter gives what some claim as MapHacks. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.000
 It gives you, passively, unobstructed vision at night, which means that 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 You will be able to see through trees and terrain, which helps you to hunt better. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
