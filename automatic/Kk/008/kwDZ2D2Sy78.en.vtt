what to call it really like an infrared

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.840 
what to call it really like an infrared
camera<00:00:15.350> that<00:00:16.350> will<00:00:16.410> detect<00:00:16.800> motion<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.730> when

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
camera that will detect motion so when

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720 
camera that will detect motion so when
the<00:00:17.940> deer<00:00:18.119> walk<00:00:18.750> past<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> camera<00:00:19.730> it'll

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the deer walk past the camera it'll

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
the deer walk past the camera it'll
transmit<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> video<00:00:21.570> down<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> house<00:00:22.320> so
