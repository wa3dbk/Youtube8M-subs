00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.110
 We are here eager to raise them in 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.600
 director of the comparsa de genio 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.710
 and director of many other great 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.710
 cádiz comparsas 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.440
 again intermón the other year more I am 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.680
 up and gave me a pattern that many 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.619
 years that I have great friendships and 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.349
 good friends but really not a lot 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.869
 before the one that surrounds nabai of my 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.340
 family and then we have a tie there 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.950
 a link with carmona I have it very 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.239
 strong still here they receive me as 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.380
 they were home because they see me a lot 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.640
 here then I am more known that is the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.150
 part of the padlock because I'm 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.310
 here a long time too 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.130
 good with groups have been coming to 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.140
 carmona almost continuously from 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.450
 the year 93 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.080
 with the miserable surely but I 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.570
 I came to the zombie year that was when 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.860
 they come to the past supplying a festival the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.920
 first that comes to carmona and I do not know 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.050
 where Carmona was and that year that year 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.990
 was I started with zombie here I think that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.409
 afterwards we have taken many, many 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.600
 years coming here for followed and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 I think I'm welcome, I'm pretty 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.189
 dear I realized that people 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 they want and that is appreciated and also has 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.350
 been one of the few directors that has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.719
 won first prizes in Cádiz 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:33.119
 the only one who has won with four is not 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.819
 an anecdote and a story in my 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.380
 curriculum I saw the carnival and it's good 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.700
 have dated the biggest ones with the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.349
 four great authors out there in the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.349
 carnival because good not 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.930
 he has that luck because he has good 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.189
 square because he worked because you're 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.899
 good people 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.420
 well I am a little yes that with authors 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.189
 but good the fruit is and not then 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.680
 as I always say all the authors that 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.840
 they have listened to me and let the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.490
 help because ultimately what help 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 I simply do not do not contribute 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.110
 help in what can go what I know then 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.929
 I usually get first prize then 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.280
 Well very happy and I think all my 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.840
 methods my goal are more than 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.870
 fulfilled then this year with the gypsies 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.220
 I'm not taking it easy 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.630
 incredible we are enjoying the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 comparsa or the most entertaining very 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.290
 fun cheerful that much rhythm a lot 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.450
 life then but if taking with much 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.849
 tranquility 20 years ago when antonio 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.920
 martínez a stated that 20 years ago 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.870
 20 years we won antonio martín 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.030
 I thought when the king never never 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 never never say I say that martínez 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.769
 would make it go up were the best 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.739
 better do not confuse the mind we were 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.079
 great rivals but there was a respect 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.420
 that nobody much respect had a 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.980
 higher word than another we 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 we respected enough 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.829
 martín ares showed it always and what 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 I say by active we almost want 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.890
 Martinists things that I fought with 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.959
 the one who did not understand you as a basis 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.459
 Martinists and you who defend our 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.829
 preventions that I super and friend of 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.870
 Mom from here it is impossible for me to 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.349
 now say no and he asked for a martyr 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.430
 and the truth was it has always been a 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.739
 followed by a great admirer among 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.329
 Martin and it was unthinkable that he would return 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.639
 I ever went out with no king but 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.799
 good the opportunity arose and the opportunity 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:19.030
 and here we are the second year if God 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.829
 wants to get there fails with him and good and 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.900
 well comfortable and working both 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.629
 respecting each other because what 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.829
 nice he gives me my site of gold 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.659
 it's not yours of course because it's 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.489
 who it is who tosa him the greatest 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.919
 the one that has the most reward is the most 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.239
 that takes more years and the best because 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.610
 has shown in his curriculum what 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.099
 avalan 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.870
 distinct is that is that what is 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.620
 complicated is to take as many years as 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.989
 takes antonio and consecutively winning 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.989
 first prizes with so many generations 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.490
 different the 2 subiela be subiela 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.200
 carmona 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.550
 It is that it only looks for in the 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.050
 years that we are and that he has 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.340
 adapted again to be subjects of the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.830
 car of the people who are there and channel 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.960
 of data from them because men the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 conversa genius pass the story because 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.560
 in a prize counted in all 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.580
 authors then it is very important I 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.020
 I say that I do not like that people 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.120
 go to resources I like to go 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.340
 because when he won then he brings me more 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.870
 the leg that not all go so 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.850
 I want everything to go because it's good 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.790
 for everyone and you would like it 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.920
 I went back to martínez again to the contest 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.630
 man to me as an amateur I think it is 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.100
 the best thing that carnival can do 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.380
 better than Carnival can happen to you because 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.650
 I think there is not one like him not then 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.720
 right now I think it's great and I think 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.200
 that more than one tremor and I think that 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.580
 more than one you would tremble among them 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.800
 of course both in bourgeois and will return 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.050
 martín you are then I believe that the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.580
 objective would be to compete against martini 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.500
 now I think that martín is the virtue that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.690
 had him and his group do not forget those 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.580
 groups was very important is important 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.270
 like Martin and I will make you do not forget to 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.090
 no one 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.530
 I think it was that it was so good so good 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.660
 that forced others the best 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.760
 then the others struggled 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.350
 double and thus magnificent comparsas for that reason 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.120
 we have had the luck I say it for the 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.340
 young people who have not lived the time 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.620
 1990s and early 2000s 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.730
 who does not know what carnival is then 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.850
 so far then you do not know what 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.610
 he climbed he forced to get the best out of 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.170
 martínez de martín the best of quiñones 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.170
 the best of so many good authors that 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.030
 you had to compete and then that's 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.530
 what you have to value of martín ar 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.630
 independently of the large 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.930
 comparsas he has made but forced 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.880
 the others that were better is the good thing 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.680
 and then and for the next year with 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.080
 the guests invite them to see what comes out 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.970
 hence, very strange things when 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.410
 antonio the names we started to laugh 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.480
 Antonio told me for your mother was that 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.910
 what when we bite we liked not 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.100
 on the line of martín and martín estado 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.790
 pure and I think good yes with the genius 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.400
 same one shot of nut and I put it in the 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.080
 line of what people want then 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.500
 because you do not have to see the king again 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.360
 pure pure state with some nuances 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.810
 exactly then where are they going 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.530
 shots 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.810
 but he unravels like a fish in the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.520
 water in this thematic lie with the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.040
 age that has antonio that still at 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.650
 young people fix them by hooking geimer and 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.880
 I believe that I believe that the rest 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.050
 of good from an examination of 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.910
 self-awareness 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.740
 oliveros gasset and I still cojones 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.990
 director, I believe that others 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.770
 would serve to look less in the mirror and 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.360
 already comparsas in conditions to say 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.669
 it's not normal for us to win Tony Martin 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.880
 these heights is not normal the pen in 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.889
 the pen already but the years do not pass in 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.210
 bucket I have what it is with the author 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.770
 which is more difficult or I have because if I 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.669
 I say or antonio if you can not think of a 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.330
 idea of anything tells me in the year 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.580
 97 and is a young pasodoble 27 occurs in 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.290
 2004 and it is a step that is very difficult 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.970
 is that he has already written everything is that the 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.800
 sing or do not say I sing it black has 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.960
 sung in argentinian has sing Uruguayan 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.810
 is the singer the languages ​​was singer 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.270
 the languages ​​then it is a weary task 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.320
 difficult to draw with new originals is 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.240
 very difficult 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.480
 Martin is very difficult that's why he has the 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.890
 double merit for that the first prize 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.890
 doubly so next year or 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.120
 We will see in the fault and we will wait for you in 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.590
 carmona no and if not for the square you go 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.289
 taking a beer as a friend what 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:25.129
 move very well thank you very much 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.129
 very well thank you very much
