low<00:01:33.030> setting<00:01:33.420> first<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> switch<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
low setting first I'm going to switch it
to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> high<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> moment<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.100> haven't

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
to the high in just a moment I haven't

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.410 
to the high in just a moment I haven't
read<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> directions<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.850> find<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
read the directions to find out what the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
read the directions to find out what the
difference<00:01:39.689> between<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.200> high<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.799> low

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
difference between the high and the low

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
difference between the high and the low
setting<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.140> hear

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
setting is but you can probably hear

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.700 
setting is but you can probably hear
that<00:01:43.590> difference<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that difference right now so here is the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.539 
that difference right now so here is the
iRig<00:01:47.100> mic<00:01:47.659> cast<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.049> ipod<00:01:49.680> iphone<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.490> all

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
personally I think the dates and audio

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.420 
personally I think the dates and audio
had<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.390> nice<00:02:31.780> body<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.950> clipped<00:02:33.220> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
had a nice body to it but it clipped and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.700 
had a nice body to it but it clipped and
I<00:02:33.820> don't<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.090> why<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.360> was<00:02:34.750> clipping<00:02:34.960> but

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
I don't know why it was clipping but

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.510 
I don't know why it was clipping but
that<00:02:35.830> sucked<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.820> iRig<00:02:37.270> was<00:02:37.600> tinny<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.520> when

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
that sucked the iRig was tinny and when

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.960 
that sucked the iRig was tinny and when
he<00:02:39.610> turned<00:02:39.850> up<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:41.260> gain<00:02:41.790> increased<00:02:42.790> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
he turned up the the gain increased the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.330 
he turned up the the gain increased the
volume<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.930> didn't<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.590> much<00:02:44.740> else<00:02:44.980> didn't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
volume but it didn't do much else didn't

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.010 
volume but it didn't do much else didn't
add<00:02:45.400> any<00:02:45.580> body<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.420> which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.840> was

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
add any body to it which is what I was

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.770 
add any body to it which is what I was
all<00:02:47.170> totally<00:02:47.740> I'm<00:02:47.950> hoping<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.270> iphone<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
all totally I'm hoping for the iphone is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.700 
all totally I'm hoping for the iphone is
is<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> little<00:02:50.650> bit<00:02:51.270> tinny<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.600> its<00:02:52.840> own<00:02:53.080> right

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
is a little bit tinny on its own right

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.740 
is a little bit tinny on its own right
so<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.580> audio<00:02:54.850> technica<00:02:55.150> comes<00:02:55.480> off<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> little

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
so the audio technica comes off a little

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.130 
so the audio technica comes off a little
bit<00:02:56.290> better<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.460> really<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.480> much<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
bit better but really not that much I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.870 
bit better but really not that much I
didn't<00:02:59.650> think<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.280> maybe<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.610> would<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.760> a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
didn't think so and maybe it would be a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.160 
didn't think so and maybe it would be a
little<00:03:01.030> bit<00:03:01.180> better<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.450> i<00:03:01.510> was<00:03:01.690> actually<00:03:01.840> had

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
little bit better if i was actually had

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.920 
little bit better if i was actually had
it<00:03:02.320> clipped<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.710> my<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:03.640> my<00:03:03.670> chest<00:03:04.210> i<00:03:04.540> might<00:03:04.900> try

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
it clipped to my to my chest i might try

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.780 
it clipped to my to my chest i might try
