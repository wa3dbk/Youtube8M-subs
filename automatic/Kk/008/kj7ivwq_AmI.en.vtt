00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.540 
write elvish yes as you can see it's
quite<00:00:23.200> complicated<00:00:23.590> but<00:00:24.099> we'll<00:00:24.310> go<00:00:24.520> through

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
quite complicated but we'll go through

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.519 
quite complicated but we'll go through
them<00:00:25.000> all

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
them all

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240 
them all
so<00:00:26.529> a<00:00:28.260> there's<00:00:29.260> three<00:00:29.560> dots<00:00:29.770> like<00:00:30.010> in<00:00:30.160> a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
so a there's three dots like in a

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.530 
so a there's three dots like in a
triangle<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:31.800> curved<00:00:32.800> line<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.699> can<00:00:33.910> end

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
triangle be curved line and I can end

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.439 
triangle be curved line and I can end
with<00:00:34.870> one<00:00:35.230> smaller<00:00:35.739> than<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.980> other<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.300> then

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
with one smaller than the other and then

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.930 
with one smaller than the other and then
a<00:00:37.480> line<00:00:37.660> underneath<00:00:38.129> well<00:00:39.129> just<00:00:39.550> look<00:00:39.730> at<00:00:39.850> it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
a line underneath well just look at it

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.180 
a line underneath well just look at it
actually<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.390> know<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.660> can<00:00:40.840> tell<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:42.489> C

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually you know you can tell there's C

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:55.130 
actually you know you can tell there's C
D<00:00:45.190> E<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.989> just<00:00:47.020> a<00:00:47.470> line<00:00:48.309> like<00:00:48.520> that<00:00:48.550> yeah<00:00:51.360> gh<00:00:52.360> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.319 

just<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.320> dot<00:00:56.559> no<00:00:57.250> come<00:00:57.879> around<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:59.760> J<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.000> K

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
just a dot no come around and J and K

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.270 
just a dot no come around and J and K
and<00:01:02.460> L<00:01:03.460> else<00:01:04.030> can<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.629> J<00:01:04.989> now<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.930> M<00:01:08.289> and<00:01:08.920> n

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
and L else can like J now that's M and n

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:19.040 
and L else can like J now that's M and n
is<00:01:09.820> basically<00:01:10.090> an<00:01:10.630> M<00:01:11.190> that's<00:01:12.190> oh<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.869> P<00:01:16.200> Q<00:01:17.200> I

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
is basically an M that's oh that's P Q I

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:29.719 
is basically an M that's oh that's P Q I
like<00:01:20.050> our<00:01:20.319> our<00:01:21.069> cool

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:40.020 

here<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:30.849> have<00:01:30.940> s<00:01:31.770> G<00:01:33.000> U<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.360> V<00:01:36.060> W<00:01:37.060> X<00:01:37.380> Y<00:01:38.380> if<00:01:39.250> Y<00:01:39.819> is<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
here we have s G U and V W X Y if Y is a

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.650 
here we have s G U and V W X Y if Y is a
vowel<00:01:40.240> it's<00:01:40.539> just<00:01:40.780> too<00:01:40.929> doc<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.410> know<00:01:41.560> E<00:01:42.660> and

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
vowel it's just too doc you know E and

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.800 
vowel it's just too doc you know E and
which<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.770> basically<00:01:45.009> your<00:01:45.459> 3<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.420> can

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
which is basically your 3 now this can

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.010 
which is basically your 3 now this can
actually<00:01:50.110> get<00:01:50.319> a<00:01:50.349> bit<00:01:50.619> complicated<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.780> I

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
actually get a bit complicated now I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually get a bit complicated now I

I wish your doodles now this is how you
do<00:02:06.220> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
do it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
do it
now<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.530> do<00:02:09.630> be<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:11.550> seen<00:02:12.550> hope<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.000> looks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.240 

then<00:02:16.570> L

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.050 

then<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.330> at<00:02:24.570> when<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.530> vowel<00:02:26.060> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
then you do at when it's a vowel you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.120 
then you do at when it's a vowel you
have<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> put<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.570> going<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.320> top<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
have to put it going on the top of the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.590 
have to put it going on the top of the
letter<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.970> comes<00:02:30.240> after<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.070> L<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
letter it comes after so this is L so a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.630 
letter it comes after so this is L so a
comes<00:02:34.080> after<00:02:34.590> L<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:36.860> goes<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.160> top<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
comes after L so a goes on top and I I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.910 
comes after L so a goes on top and I I
actually<00:02:41.970> came<00:02:42.390> after<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:45.060> vowel<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
actually came after a but the vowel the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.700 
actually came after a but the vowel the
consonants<00:02:47.580> are<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> meant<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.200> can't<00:02:49.500> it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
consonants are a meant that it can't it

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.310 
consonants are a meant that it can't it
goes<00:02:49.980> over<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> continent<00:02:50.790> comes<00:02:51.000> after<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
goes over the continent comes after the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.500 
goes over the continent comes after the
consonant<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.580> actually<00:02:53.910> came<00:02:54.180> after<00:02:54.480> was

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
consonant that I actually came after was

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.640 
consonant that I actually came after was
the<00:02:55.140> L<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:57.480> goes<00:02:57.690> up<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:58.020> as<00:02:58.140> well<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the L so it goes up here as well so the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.140 
the L so it goes up here as well so the
B<00:02:58.950> L<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.800> F<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:04.580> then<00:03:05.580> because

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
B L a I and we have F and then because

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
B L a I and we have F and then because
it's<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.450> silent<00:03:06.720> e<00:03:06.959> goes<00:03:07.410> under<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:10.010> so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
it's a silent e goes under here so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.540 
it's a silent e goes under here so
that's<00:03:11.850> how<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> write<00:03:12.660> my<00:03:13.410> name<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.250> if<00:03:14.400> I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
that's how you write my name but if I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.480 
that's how you write my name but if I
was<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> ride<00:03:16.070> Bob<00:03:17.810> random<00:03:18.810> name<00:03:18.990> but<00:03:19.490> Bob

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
was to ride Bob random name but Bob

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.640 
was to ride Bob random name but Bob
would<00:03:20.850> be<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> B<00:03:24.650> then

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
would be like this you do the B then

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.170 
would be like this you do the B then
after<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> B<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.330> O<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
after the B you would do the O and you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.780 
after the B you would do the O and you
do<00:03:30.390> another<00:03:30.510> B<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:32.450> touch<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:34.350> it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.880 

it's<00:03:39.790> gonna<00:03:40.030> like<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.810> they<00:03:41.650> read

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
it's gonna like that that that they read

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.340 
it's gonna like that that that they read
it<00:03:42.010> like<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> that's<00:03:49.840> how<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.050> would<00:03:50.230> do

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
it like that so that's how you would do

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.720 
it like that so that's how you would do
fault<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.850> let's<00:03:52.090> say<00:03:52.450> Arthur<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> that's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
fault and let's say Arthur so that's
