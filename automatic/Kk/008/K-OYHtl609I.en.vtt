marine animals were interested in their

marine animals were interested in their

physiology and their evolution in
particular<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.730> study<00:00:12.000> their<00:00:12.360> early<00:00:12.870> stages

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

and embryos and these early life cycle

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.130 
and embryos and these early life cycle
stages<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:18.060> interesting<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:18.990> really

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
stages are interesting and really

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200

we have no idea what happened to them we

to adulthood we've worked on these

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.580 
to adulthood we've worked on these

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.580 
and the west coast and in the last few
years<00:00:42.239> we've<00:00:42.690> started<00:00:42.870> working<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.440> these

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
years we've started working on these

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
years we've started working on these
questions<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> Antarctic<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
questions in the Antarctic this is a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
questions in the Antarctic this is a
unique<00:00:46.350> environment<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.280> extremely<00:00:48.000> cold

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
unique environment it's extremely cold

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
unique environment it's extremely cold
which<00:00:48.629> makes<00:00:48.960> life<00:00:49.410> cycles<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.160> slow<00:00:50.520> these

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
which makes life cycles very slow these

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
which makes life cycles very slow these
things<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.420> years<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> develop<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
things take years to develop which is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
things take years to develop which is
unique<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:53.789> interested<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.480> what

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
unique and we're very interested in what

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.470 
unique and we're very interested in what
that<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> their<00:00:55.800> biology

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
that does to their biology

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.220 
that does to their biology
physiologically<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> deal<00:00:58.050> with

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
physiologically they have to deal with

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
physiologically they have to deal with
extreme<00:00:58.710> cold<00:00:59.039> enzymes<00:00:59.640> don't<00:00:59.969> work<00:01:00.180> very

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
extreme cold enzymes don't work very

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
extreme cold enzymes don't work very
well<00:01:00.570> things<00:01:01.170> function<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.010> differently

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
well things function very differently

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
well things function very differently
and<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.879> oxygen<00:01:03.000> environment<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.989> unique

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and the oxygen environment is unique

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
and the oxygen environment is unique
down<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.860> there's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> tremendous<00:01:05.339> amount

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
down there there's a tremendous amount

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
down there there's a tremendous amount
of<00:01:05.880> oxygen<00:01:06.060> slow<00:01:06.689> rates<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> oxygen<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
of oxygen slow rates of oxygen use and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
of oxygen slow rates of oxygen use and
and<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.670> created<00:01:08.939> some<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.990> unique

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and this has created some some unique

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
and this has created some some unique
evolutionary<00:01:10.909> strategies<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.270> animals

the Antarctic is a spectacularly

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.039 
constant 24-hour daylight when we were

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
there so when you when you first go

there so when you when you first go

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
through the hole in the ice it was very

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
through the hole in the ice it was very
bright<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> surface<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> go

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
bright on the surface and then you go

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.569 
bright on the surface and then you go
underwater<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.920> can't<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.340> anything

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
underwater and you can't see anything

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
underwater and you can't see anything
for<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> minute<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.600> eyes<00:01:33.720> adjust

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
for a minute and then your eyes adjust

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
for a minute and then your eyes adjust
and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> rocks<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.759> the
