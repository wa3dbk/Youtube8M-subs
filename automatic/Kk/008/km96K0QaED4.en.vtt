version you can jump in on law right but
now<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.590> was<00:03:49.710> the<00:03:49.740> weakness<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.400> now<00:03:50.520> you

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
now that was the weakness but now you

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.610 
now that was the weakness but now you
cannot<00:03:51.060> submit<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.510> muscle<00:03:52.220> how's<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:54.620> it

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
cannot submit on muscle how's that it

cannot submit on muscle how's that it
takes<00:03:55.890> away<00:03:56.010> all<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.310> weaknesses<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.850> law

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
takes away all the weaknesses of law

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450 
takes away all the weaknesses of law
like<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.660> scene<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.290> think<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.710> think<00:03:59.190> Justin

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
like and scene I think I think Justin

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.980 
like and scene I think I think Justin
it's<00:03:59.580> kind<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:03.800> Lena<00:04:04.800> Lisa<00:04:05.330> -<00:04:06.330> wall<00:04:06.720> you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
it's kind of like Lena Lisa - wall you

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.950 
it's kind of like Lena Lisa - wall you
might<00:04:07.170> as<00:04:07.350> well<00:04:07.380> Justin<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.070> know

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.780 

you<00:04:15.380> think<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.680> Justin<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.160> counting<00:04:16.580> on<00:04:16.670> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
you think that Justin is counting on the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.990 
you think that Justin is counting on the
fact<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.150> maybe<00:04:17.560> Seth<00:04:18.560> lolol<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.490> not<00:04:19.700> as

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
fact that maybe Seth lolol is not as

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.260 
fact that maybe Seth lolol is not as
familiar<00:04:20.210> with<00:04:20.450> Elena<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:22.060> well<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.090> mean

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
familiar with Elena and well I mean

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.770 
familiar with Elena and well I mean
someplace<00:04:23.570> on<00:04:23.900> my<00:04:24.020> block<00:04:24.290> but<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:25.550> that

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
someplace on my block but I think that

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.010 
someplace on my block but I think that
more<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.020> than<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:28.220> range<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:29.020> Elena

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
more so than that the range that Elena

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.380 
more so than that the range that Elena
has<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:31.220> block<00:04:31.520> stuff<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.850> Alisa<00:04:32.090> puts

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
has and the block stuff that Alisa puts

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.060 
has and the block stuff that Alisa puts
you<00:04:32.510> in<00:04:32.660> will<00:04:33.410> allow<00:04:33.650> him<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.860> actually

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
you in will allow him to actually

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.590 
you in will allow him to actually
