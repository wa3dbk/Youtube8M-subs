00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 guys you're filming things a lot 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 strange in the sky do not know if our cane 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 Are you able to catch but are you eyes? 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.559
 several white dots coming out of the sun and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.559
 they are fast 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:29.250
 there are some who seem to look like 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.980
 powder type yes but that does not look there or 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.630
 going to the left side 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.630
 they vary a lot of position 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:51.469
 look at the very big speed guys 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.469
 they alternate a lot of direction 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 we can see right there 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.650
 has a balloon on the other side that has a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.409
 balloon flying too but it's not balloon 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 It's things like that, you go too fast. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 the sound dissipates the question of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.970
 seconds 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 It's crazy, this is happening in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:30.530

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.200
 they are going towards the beach 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.200

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.149

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 hum and seems to be far away I know if someone 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.140
 You got to see that today you 're filming the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.720
 My camera does not have a very large one. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.720
