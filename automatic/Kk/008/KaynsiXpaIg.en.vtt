00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:16.940
 I will explain it to you 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.039
 there is a preparation part there is a trick 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.020
 the preparation is very simple 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 all the cards of one color and all the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 cards of the other color divided and between of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 they will therefore have the violet half in this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849
 case all blacks than the second half of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 all red 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.760
 ok the only thing i have to do is months 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 pretends to mix by holding one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.739
 There are different color separation 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 ways to mix them in false precede i 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.780
 two most used one is called ireland 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 I do it up high that you see 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.360
 What happen 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.110
 start mixing one side internally 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 who will be off but come out 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 when I signed up I approached 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.800
 in the middle of the rocket the mid-March start 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 to pass one by one 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 who when it exceeded half and then 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 I randomly shuffle this way I have 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 inverted colors between them but 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.000
 I keep separate I do 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 it doesn't happen very fast 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 this opens up people are going to be at 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 home towards the goal one by one 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.939
 so far i'm sure i've passed the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.360
 half and booty to mix at home in 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.490
 this way the colors remain separate 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.939
 another way is what is called 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 concoction with a cut game less than the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 half from below 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.869
 less than half so they will all be of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 a color the first the dough getting it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 towards me and then they succeed over 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:46.560
 In this case I have marked the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 cutout separation there is again the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.659
 separate cards star skills of each 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.899
 decide which to do as soon as possible 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.310
 mix the videos I watch stiff where it is 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 finished exactly by color later 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 complain commented and I ask you to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.860
 mix and unexplored the earth people 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.990
 the deck that was really mixed 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.989
 pierced you are mixing the reds and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.000
 supports downing gender now I say a 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.010
 clear reds to focus only on 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.569
 red to those who train chelsea alone 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.239
 on the sights now a bluff 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.670
 I give myself three cards so they go 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.930
 think that a card that the card that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.129
 you are passing your color 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.810
 rolled near you 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.300
 what you think are different 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:34.080
 throw yourself in the middle and you try but 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 started after a while I stop stopped a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.819
 second turn the faces born and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.830
 keep it up so let's see what happens in 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.870
 reality is a bluff because you have all 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.099
 red when you throw away 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.030
 go and mix this here 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.030
 deceives the public 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.460
 ok so let's get back what they see 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.070
 respected 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.150
 you have finished I say obviously 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.310
 when a mixture of red was taken 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.360
 and black to all focused on red and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.020
 in fact here are all the reds 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 here are all the mere liked are 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.140
 15 euros 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.140
