00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
although I'm not particularly following

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.280 
although I'm not particularly following
the<00:01:07.250> chords<00:01:07.580> too<00:01:07.820> closely<00:01:08.120> I'm<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:09.080> playing

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
the chords too closely I'm just playing

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.870 
the chords too closely I'm just playing
in<00:01:09.440> c-sharp<00:01:09.620> minor<00:01:10.070> which<00:01:10.250> still<00:01:10.460> has<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.610> good

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
in c-sharp minor which still has a good

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.730 
in c-sharp minor which still has a good
feel<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.300> I'm<00:01:11.360> kind<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:11.900> using<00:01:12.170> my<00:01:12.290> ear<00:01:12.530> to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
feel and I'm kind of using my ear to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.560 
feel and I'm kind of using my ear to
follow<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.610> core<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.060> notes<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.420> sound

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
follow the the core the notes that sound

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.300 
follow the the core the notes that sound
good<00:01:14.870> against<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.380> chord<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:15.980> still<00:01:16.160> has<00:01:16.190> a

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
good against the chord so it still has a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.550 
good against the chord so it still has a
good<00:01:16.430> melodic<00:01:17.030> content<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.870> not<00:01:18.020> paying<00:01:18.320> that

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
good melodic content I'm not paying that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.960 
good melodic content I'm not paying that
close<00:01:18.740> attention<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.400> progression<00:01:19.850> as

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
close attention to the progression as

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.130 
close attention to the progression as
let's<00:01:20.720> say<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> jazz<00:01:21.140> player<00:01:21.440> would<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:23.140> let's
