00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the solutions okay and then the hook for

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
with a feasibility study on having a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310

small-scale garden on campus a concept

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.890 
small-scale garden on campus a concept
yes<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> wasn't<00:01:11.430> meant<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.900> reality

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

well I thought maybe I'd use it to write

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
well I thought maybe I'd use it to write
some<00:01:14.640> grants<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.119> maybe<00:01:15.270> make<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
some grants and maybe make it into a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.460 
some grants and maybe make it into a
reality

is<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.420> across<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> street<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is right across the street from the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
is right across the street from the
dining<00:01:40.619> halls<00:01:40.799> well<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> wanted<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
dining halls well we wanted that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
dining halls well we wanted that
connection<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> students<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:43.920> they're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
connection so that students when they're

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
connection so that students when they're
eating<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.180> where<00:01:45.390> their

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
eating they actually see where their

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
eating they actually see where their
food<00:01:45.630> comes<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> idea<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
food comes from so there's this idea of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
food comes from so there's this idea of
eating<00:01:48.000> locally<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:49.140> local<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.710> mean<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
eating locally really local I mean and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
eating locally really local I mean and
you've<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.030> full<00:01:51.299> circle<00:01:51.689> going

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
you've got kind of a full circle going

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.190 
you've got kind of a full circle going
the<00:01:52.170> food<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.649> grown<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.509> eaten<00:01:54.899> here

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the food is grown here it's eaten here

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
the food is grown here it's eaten here
and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.009> circle<00:01:56.369> goes<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.790> there

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and then the circle goes back there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
and then the circle goes back there
that's<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> food<00:01:58.649> prep<00:01:58.920> waste

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that's right all of the food prep waste

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
that's right all of the food prep waste
peels<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.360> such<00:02:00.570> goes<00:02:00.899> actually<00:02:01.140> back<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
peels and such goes actually back to the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
peels and such goes actually back to the
garden<00:02:02.310> where<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.729> composted<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> put

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
garden where it's composted and put

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.149 
garden where it's composted and put
right<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> garden<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:04.950> part<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
right back in the garden that's part of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
right back in the garden that's part of
the<00:02:05.250> sustainability<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.299> whatever<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.200> take

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the sustainability is whatever you take

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
the sustainability is whatever you take
out<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.860> putting<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.119> there's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
out you're putting back so there's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
out you're putting back so there's
there's<00:02:09.899> no<00:02:10.590> carbon<00:02:10.950> footprint<00:02:11.340> basically<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
there's no carbon footprint basically I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.040 
there's no carbon footprint basically I
mean<00:02:12.150> you're

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
mean you're

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.510 
mean you're
you're<00:02:13.410> maintaining<00:02:13.950> yourself<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
you're maintaining yourself and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.070 
you're maintaining yourself and
maintaining<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.060> garden<00:02:15.510> mm-hmm

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
maintaining that garden mm-hmm

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230 
maintaining that garden mm-hmm
we<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.500> bring<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.240> compostable

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
we actually bring in compostable

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.730 
we actually bring in compostable
materials<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:18.810> local<00:02:19.110> restaurants<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
materials from local restaurants and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.800 
materials from local restaurants and
stuff<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:20.040> well<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.580> build<00:02:21.000> even<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.300> compost

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
stuff as well to build even more compost

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
stuff as well to build even more compost
okay<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:23.480> minimizing<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
okay so you're really minimizing the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.270 
okay so you're really minimizing the
impact<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> environment<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.740> feeding

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
impact on the environment and feeding

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.220 
impact on the environment and feeding
the<00:02:26.940> students<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.780> are<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.900> students

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the students and what are the students

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.280 
the students and what are the students

on this or how does it run well the
other<00:02:52.410> element<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.250> sustainability<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:53.880> us

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
other element of sustainability for us

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.550 
other element of sustainability for us
is<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:54.990> student-run

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
is to have this be as a student-run

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.430 
is to have this be as a student-run
garden<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.820> there's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.900> club<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.380> campus

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
garden so there's a club on campus

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.190 
garden so there's a club on campus
that's<00:02:58.980> also<00:02:59.190> called<00:02:59.400> slug<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.660> works<00:03:01.020> very

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that's also called slug that works very

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
that's also called slug that works very
closely<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.800> foodservice<00:03:02.640> will<00:03:03.240> don't

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
closely with foodservice will don't

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.970 
closely with foodservice will don't
Appetit<00:03:03.810> who<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.050> our<00:03:04.170> food<00:03:04.350> service<00:03:04.650> provider

now<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:06.290> plan<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.530> what<00:03:08.370> should<00:03:08.550> be<00:03:08.610> grown

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
now to plan out what should be grown

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760 
now to plan out what should be grown
over<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> course<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.960> year<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.680> they

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
over the course of the year what do they

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
over the course of the year what do they
want<00:03:11.010> more<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:12.030> did<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.270> grow<00:03:12.390> too<00:03:12.510> much

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
want more of what did we grow too much

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.320 
want more of what did we grow too much
of<00:03:13.070> last<00:03:14.070> year<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.490> they<00:03:14.580> couldn't<00:03:14.820> use<00:03:14.880> for

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
of last year that they couldn't use for

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.690 
of last year that they couldn't use for
example<00:03:15.420> okay<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:17.040> work<00:03:17.220> very<00:03:17.250> closely
