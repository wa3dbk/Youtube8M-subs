right<00:00:42.090> now<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.260> start<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:43.890> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
right now but the start when i actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
right now but the start when i actually
started<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> community<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.570> school<00:00:45.809> because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
started a community of school because

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.520 
started a community of school because
i'm<00:00:46.500> taking<00:00:46.739> online<00:00:46.890> classes<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:48.600> hit<00:00:48.809> 20<00:00:49.140> k<00:00:49.320> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
i'm taking online classes to hit 20 k on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
i'm taking online classes to hit 20 k on
my<00:00:49.559> youtube<00:00:49.890> account<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.399> unfortunately

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
my youtube account but unfortunately

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.770 
my youtube account but unfortunately
that's<00:00:51.090> probably<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.450> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> happen

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that's probably not going to happen

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500 
that's probably not going to happen
because<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:52.469> haven't<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.120> been<00:00:54.120> growing<00:00:54.390> as

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
because i haven't really been growing as

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
because i haven't really been growing as
fast<00:00:54.540> as<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.050> would<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.010> haven't

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
fast as I would like and I haven't

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
fast as I would like and I haven't
really<00:00:56.730> been<00:00:57.059> doing<00:00:57.440> too<00:00:58.440> much<00:00:58.590> content<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really been doing too much content I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
really been doing too much content I
like<00:00:59.850> most<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.149> content<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.840> showdown

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like most my content is just showdown

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
like most my content is just showdown
and<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.579> help<00:01:02.760> me<00:01:02.879> grow

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and that's not gonna really help me grow

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.249 
and that's not gonna really help me grow
so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> start<00:01:03.570> doing<00:01:03.690> Wi-Fi<00:01:03.989> battles

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
so I have to start doing Wi-Fi battles

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.800 
so I have to start doing Wi-Fi battles
again<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.770> will<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.489> doing<00:01:05.610> Omega<00:01:06.180> Ruby<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
definitely did promise that earlier but

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.919
