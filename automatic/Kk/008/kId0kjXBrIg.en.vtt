00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.040 
and then we feel like the steering felt
funny<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.460> thought<00:05:12.240> we<00:05:12.389> had<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.540> broken

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
funny and thought we had a broken

control arm but really just lost the
whole<00:05:16.110> shock<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:16.910> we<00:05:17.910> still<00:05:18.030> have<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.210> spring

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
whole shock so we still have a spring

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
so I'm just going to wear on a spring to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.700 
so I'm just going to wear on a spring to
