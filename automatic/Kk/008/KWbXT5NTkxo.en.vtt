00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.940
 very good, well, I'll discount them 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.270
 put today we bring you the unboxing of 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.830
 experiente v is a phone that is by 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.070
 say somehow anti knuckle 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.070
 is now one year old but now 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.800
 it's pretty well sold and that's what 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.630
 offer better now between this and the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.630
 blackberry you take this 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.930
 here you see that it is updateable 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 I speak and 4.0 of the house if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 it comes with 2.3.4 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 what is the version that I have and now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.070
 example on my terminal is not bad 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.050
 let's talk a little bit about what it is 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.909
 the screen and all that has a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.690
 screen 480 x 854 pixels of 3.7 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.180
 inches 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.070
 has a camera that makes videos on high 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.729
 definition that is something that was very 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.680
 well a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.070
 accepted 3.5 mm connection 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.380
 you have hdmi you can put a card 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.720
 up to 32 gigas bone is a terminal 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.350
 pretty good one thing that I do not like 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.850
 is that it is quite finite but more holy 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.009
 is wider upwards higher towards 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.500
 up and it's one thing that I do not like about 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 the phones well here we have the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.170
 phone to then we'll take a look 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 It's a supposed a boxing I always say 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 which are phones that have already been 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.490
 used and that leave me to be able 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.810
 do this 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.220
 the charger a microusb cable 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.770
 what is it that you are going to be able to pass 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.619
 data from the computer or upload it to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.470
 through this this adapter that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.509
 As you can see, it has a USB connection 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.039
 now this is what it takes 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.110
 now and a hdmi connection and you can see 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.310
 because what this is good because this 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.659
 finished I said it has a 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.880
 hdmi connection 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.100
 can you connect to the TV watching 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.800
 movies from the phone or use 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.349
 the phone as an android tv by 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.760
 example that is pretty good and 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.790
 good headphones that this is not what 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.970
 spend almost nobody because they are headphones 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.970
 that are not very well finished 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.930
 now watch the battery 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.930
 madrid plants 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.700
 and we pass them to a second that is here 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.050
 is what had been a good side 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.610
 Well let's see a little what is the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.610
 phone let's put it to the point 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.050
 the one that has screen saver and has 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.510
 said that they have already used is a 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.250
 phone that prompts a little to navigate 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.870
 clear it has a pretty big screen 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.960
 it's not the biggest I've come to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 see but it's pretty good 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.230
 and well we do a little review of the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.540
 connections and that first before doing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.740
 nothing like I said the camera in hd's 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.690
 5 megapixels 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.630
 we have the physical buttons this that we 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.040
 takes to the home the one of bach and the one that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.240
 open the drop- down menu of any 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.260
 application then the camera button 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.410
 then you have to raise or lower the volume 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.160
 lock and turn off phone connection jack 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.160
 of three and a half 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 microusb connection 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.770
 and hdmi connection that this is one thing that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.770
 I liked it a lot 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.180
 now let's make a small 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.819
 incised what is the battery we have a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.629
 battery that 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.860
 by dimensions, it 's pretty good 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:57.360
 what is more or less what has d 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.290
 of autonomy I do not know in the pages and everything 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.000
 that usually say that it holds over 400 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.530
 waiting hours and things like that but that 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.200
 It is always a lie because what they want 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.400
 is to sell the phone that you never 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.079
 creeis not me 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.540
 I've had more than an hour I lost 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.030
 that he said he had hours waiting for 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.160
 everything and a measure of china goes off every 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.360
 two times three 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.360
 here you have the battery 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.670
 the truth that this has a bit of 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.760
 discomfort 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.460
 I have done badly 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.010
 do not give you the finishes in general 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.290
 phone are pretty good and the good 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.330
 is that being fashionable now is a 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.610
 thing that I always talk about it 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.150
 you'll find them in all 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.680
 sides 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.849
 where it will reach deep for 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.449
 experience 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.509
 then nothing we put it to point 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.419
 and if you liked this video what 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.139
 you can do now to see how it goes and 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.309
 all that is to spend all this review 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.789
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.789
 until next time
