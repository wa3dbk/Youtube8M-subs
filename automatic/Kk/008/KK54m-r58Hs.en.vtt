there's a specific metal flake that is

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.029 
there's a specific metal flake that is
now<00:01:23.740> added<00:01:24.189> to<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.340> matte<00:01:24.640> Plasti<00:01:25.149> Dip<00:01:26.009> okay<00:01:27.009> I

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
now added to the matte Plasti Dip okay I

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.010 
now added to the matte Plasti Dip okay I
flipped<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> wheel<00:01:27.759> around<00:01:28.030> now<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.539> just<00:01:28.570> did

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
flipped the wheel around now I just did

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:45.330 
flipped the wheel around now I just did
silver<00:01:29.440> I'm<00:01:29.560> gonna<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:29.830> gold<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:45.310> I

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
silver I'm gonna do gold now I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.850 
silver I'm gonna do gold now I
personally<00:01:45.880> think<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.810> gold<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.530> just<00:01:47.619> a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
personally think that the gold is just a

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.289 
personally think that the gold is just a
little<00:01:48.100> bit<00:01:48.220> cooler<00:01:48.490> than<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.819> silver<00:01:49.179> the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
little bit cooler than the silver the

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.230 
little bit cooler than the silver the
reason<00:01:49.630> why<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.860> gold<00:01:51.159> affects<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.940> black

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
reason why is the gold affects the black

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.300 
reason why is the gold affects the black
specifically<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> point<00:01:53.770> where<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.069> shows

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
specifically to the point where it shows

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.389 
specifically to the point where it shows
almost<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.850> bronzing<00:01:55.509> type<00:01:55.720> effect<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:57.220> is

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
almost a bronzing type effect this is

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.070 
almost a bronzing type effect this is
only<00:01:57.549> with<00:01:57.789> one<00:01:58.030> coat<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.360> I'm<00:01:58.630> sure<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.899> guys

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
only with one coat and I'm sure you guys

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.230 
only with one coat and I'm sure you guys
can<00:01:59.259> see<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> difference<00:01:59.590> there's<00:02:00.580> almost<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
can see the difference there's almost a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.080 
can see the difference there's almost a
blackish<00:02:01.750> bronze<00:02:02.640> finish<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> wheel<00:02:04.060> now

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
blackish bronze finish on the wheel now

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.789 
blackish bronze finish on the wheel now
