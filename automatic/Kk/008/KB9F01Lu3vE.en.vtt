I<00:02:52.169> worry<00:02:52.650> about<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> sense<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.699> is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
I worry about it in the sense that it is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.300 
I worry about it in the sense that it is
a<00:02:53.880> record<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.650> win<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:55.980> year<00:02:56.220> it

a record that if we can win this year it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.830 
a record that if we can win this year it
breaks<00:02:56.549> all<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> modern<00:02:57.150> records<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.600> think
