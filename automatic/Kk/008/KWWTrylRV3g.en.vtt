00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
as in guys today I'm going to review an

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.600 
as in guys today I'm going to review an
app<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.360> iPad<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:10.170> course<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.280> seed

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
app for the iPad as course that seed

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.430 
app for the iPad as course that seed
it's<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.090> photography<00:00:12.630> app<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.170> edit

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it's a photography app so you can edit

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's a photography app so you can edit
all<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.769> pictures<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.969> think<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
all your pictures and I think it's the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.820 
all your pictures and I think it's the
most<00:00:15.509> professional<00:00:15.929> photography<00:00:16.560> app<00:00:16.650> I've

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
most professional photography app I've

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.490 
most professional photography app I've
actually<00:00:17.010> come<00:00:17.250> across<00:00:18.050> so<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
actually come across so this is what the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.740 
actually come across so this is what the
application<00:00:19.619> looks<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.730> you've<00:00:21.330> got<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
application looks like and you've got a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.920 
application looks like and you've got a
few<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.939> effects<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.600> left-hand

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
few different effects on the left-hand

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.300 
few different effects on the left-hand
side<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.529> preview<00:00:25.859> windows<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
side and your preview windows on the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.560 
side and your preview windows on the
right<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.300> let's<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.779> open<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.500> image<00:00:29.570> one

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
right so let's just open up an image one

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.459 
right so let's just open up an image one
that<00:00:30.810> I've<00:00:30.929> taken<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:32.840> get<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.350> for

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that I've taken I get that one there for

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.150 
that I've taken I get that one there for
example<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:36.930> picture<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> took<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> cork<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
example as a picture I took of cork a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
example as a picture I took of cork a
sorcerer<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:38.910> through<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> few<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sorcerer will go through a few of the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
sorcerer will go through a few of the
options<00:00:39.950> you<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.160> autocorrect<00:00:41.989> whereas

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
options you got your autocorrect whereas

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.979 
options you got your autocorrect whereas
you<00:00:43.079> changes<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.570> adjust<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you changes it so adjust it to what it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.389 
you changes it so adjust it to what it
thinks<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.379> should<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.620> correct<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.219> don't

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
thinks it should be correct if you don't

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.010 
thinks it should be correct if you don't
like<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.910> press<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.149> back<00:00:49.430> or<00:00:50.989> there<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like it just press it back or there is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080 
like it just press it back or there is
an<00:00:52.260> undo<00:00:52.559> button<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.789> apply

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
an undo button as well and you can apply

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
an undo button as well and you can apply
that<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.410> i'm<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that if you like as well so i'm going to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.869 
that if you like as well so i'm going to
apply<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:58.520> then<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.699> us

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
apply that for now and then we get us

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.060 
apply that for now and then we get us
done<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> other<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:01.980> selective<00:01:02.760> adjust

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
done the other one is selective adjust

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.410 
done the other one is selective adjust
where<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.280> adjust<00:01:05.369> different<00:01:05.970> points<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
where you can adjust different points in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.109 
where you can adjust different points in
your<00:01:06.630> image<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.439> add<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.830> point<00:01:08.130> there

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.429 

and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> pinpoint<00:01:12.540> exactly<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and you can pinpoint exactly where you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.410 
and you can pinpoint exactly where you
want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.640> edit<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.380> soon<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
want to do your edit so as soon as you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
want to do your edit so as soon as you
apply<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.770> your<00:01:19.920> effect

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
apply where you want to do your effect

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.560 
apply where you want to do your effect
you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> change<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.259> radius<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> effect

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you can change the radius of the effect

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can change the radius of the effect
and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.259> I've<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.890> set<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> brightness

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and then I've got to set to brightness

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
and then I've got to set to brightness
at<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> moment<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.979> increase

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
at the moment so i can actually increase

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.539 
at the moment so i can actually increase
the<00:01:29.100> brightness<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.930> darken<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:32.340> works

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the brightness or darken it and it works

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
the brightness or darken it and it works
really<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.630> I've<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:33.900> cranked

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
really really well so I've just cranked

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
really really well so I've just cranked
the<00:01:34.409> brightness<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> again

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the brightness right up there and again

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
the brightness right up there and again
I<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.990> move<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.560> lucky<00:01:37.860> where<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I can move that you're lucky where I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.999 
I can move that you're lucky where I
want<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.320> dark<00:01:40.560> there

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
want so I think that's a bit dark there

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.450 
want so I think that's a bit dark there
so<00:01:41.880> I've<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.420> increased<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.340> what

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so I've just increased it so that's what

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.980 
so I've just increased it so that's what
it<00:01:44.490> normally<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.570> tell<00:01:45.630> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it normally is as you can tell it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
it normally is as you can tell it's
quite<00:01:46.110> dark<00:01:46.530> especially<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.729> area<00:01:47.909> here

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
quite dark especially in this area here

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.289 
quite dark especially in this area here
so<00:01:48.420> let's<00:01:48.570> try<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> move<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so let's try it here so if I move the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
so let's try it here so if I move the
pointer<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.229> increase<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
pointer to right there increase the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.450 
pointer to right there increase the
brightness<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.280> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
brightness and there we go that's just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
brightness and there we go that's just
boosted<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> brightness<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.600> bit

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
boosted the brightness up a little bit

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.340 
boosted the brightness up a little bit
i'll<00:01:58.290> hit<00:01:58.469> apply<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:00.200> there<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.320> go

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
i'll hit apply on there and there we go

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
i'll hit apply on there and there we go
so<00:02:02.100> selective<00:02:02.610> adjusting<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.180> that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so selective adjusting you can do that

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.209 
so selective adjusting you can do that
the<00:02:03.420> contrast<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.049> color<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the contrast and color as well but that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.789 
the contrast and color as well but that
was<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> brightness<00:02:06.110> tune<00:02:07.110> image<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
was just the brightness tune image this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
was just the brightness tune image this
way<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> bit<00:02:08.489> more<00:02:08.670> depth<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
way you can go in a bit more depth and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
way you can go in a bit more depth and
you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.450> change<00:02:09.720> different<00:02:10.020> things

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you can change different things

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.369 
you can change different things
so<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.549> by<00:02:11.640> swiping<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.060> finger<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
so just by swiping your finger down and

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.339 
so just by swiping your finger down and
then<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.799> can<00:02:13.980> change<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.819> brightness

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
then you can change the brightness

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.959 
then you can change the brightness
ambience<00:02:16.349> contrast<00:02:17.129> saturation<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.819> white

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
ambience contrast saturation and white

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.509 
ambience contrast saturation and white
balance<00:02:18.359> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.079> whole<00:02:19.230> image<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.459> want

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
balance of the whole image so if I want

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.220 
balance of the whole image so if I want
to<00:02:20.609> change<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.909> contrast<00:02:21.239> give<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.109> bit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
to change the contrast give it a bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
to change the contrast give it a bit
more<00:02:22.260> contrast<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:22.889> I<00:02:22.920> swipe<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.249> the<00:02:23.340> right

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
more contrast than I swipe to the right

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.899 
more contrast than I swipe to the right
I<00:02:23.849> can<00:02:24.359> increase<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.049> or<00:02:25.200> decrease<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.189> to

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
I can increase it or decrease it to

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.679 
I can increase it or decrease it to
whatever<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.290> i<00:02:28.409> have<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:28.739> about

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
whatever I like so if i have it about

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.940 
whatever I like so if i have it about
there<00:02:30.689> i'm<00:02:30.870> quite<00:02:31.079> happy<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.739> about

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
there i'm quite happy with it just about

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.140 
there i'm quite happy with it just about
there<00:02:32.250> hit<00:02:32.819> apply<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.549> there<00:02:35.549> we<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
there hit apply and there we go so it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
there hit apply and there we go so it
gives<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.629> quite<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> lot<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.079> in-depth<00:02:37.469> firm

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
gives you quite a lot of in-depth firm

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.890 
gives you quite a lot of in-depth firm
tuning<00:02:38.310> obviously<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.150> crop<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.629> well<00:02:39.780> which

tuning obviously your crop as well which

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.020 
tuning obviously your crop as well which
is<00:02:40.019> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.409> obvious<00:02:43.609> detail<00:02:44.609> so<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.879> can

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
is kind of obvious detail so you can

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360 
is kind of obvious detail so you can
increase<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.419> sharpness<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.139> well<00:02:46.319> same<00:02:47.159> sort

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
increase the sharpness as well same sort

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.770

of<00:02:47.430> effect<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.120> drag<00:02:48.269> up<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.599> down

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
of effect so you can drag up and down

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.220 
of effect so you can drag up and down
and<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> structure<00:02:50.310> as<00:02:50.489> well<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:52.079> can<00:02:52.139> just

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and go to structure as well you can just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.619 
and go to structure as well you can just
change<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.709> whole<00:02:52.980> look<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:54.060> image<00:02:54.419> so

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
change the whole look of your image so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.629 
change the whole look of your image so
they<00:02:55.290> go<00:02:55.439> that's<00:02:55.620> kind<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.889> exaggerated<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
they go that's kind of exaggerated the

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.569 
they go that's kind of exaggerated the
whole<00:02:56.819> image<00:02:56.939> hit<00:02:57.780> apply<00:03:01.250> straighten<00:03:02.250> kind<00:03:02.519> of

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
whole image hit apply straighten kind of

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.439 
whole image hit apply straighten kind of
obvious<00:03:02.879> what<00:03:02.969> that<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.829> as<00:03:04.829> well<00:03:05.449> black

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
obvious what that one is as well black

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.890 
obvious what that one is as well black
and<00:03:06.689> white<00:03:06.859> vintage<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.849> many<00:03:09.060> different

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and white vintage so so many different

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.379 
and white vintage so so many different
effects<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.409> can<00:03:10.439> add<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.859> even<00:03:11.549> frames<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
effects you can add on even frames and

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.610 
effects you can add on even frames and
now<00:03:12.510> these<00:03:12.689> phones<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.049> actually<00:03:13.260> quite<00:03:13.379> nice

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
now these phones are actually quite nice

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.249 
now these phones are actually quite nice
they<00:03:14.489> call<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.730> organic<00:03:15.180> frames<00:03:15.449> but<00:03:15.689> if<00:03:16.139> we

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:16.259 
they call it organic frames but if we

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.839 
they call it organic frames but if we
shuffle<00:03:16.590> through<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.799> few<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.069> them<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.489> you

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
shuffle through a few of them and you

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.059 
shuffle through a few of them and you
can<00:03:18.000> see<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:20.069> different<00:03:21.560> styles<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.829> framing

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
can see the different styles are framing

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.020 
can see the different styles are framing
you<00:03:23.879> can<00:03:24.030> get<00:03:24.209> which<00:03:24.599> is<00:03:24.629> kind<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.989> cool<00:03:26.030> one

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you can get which is kind of cool one

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.699 
you can get which is kind of cool one
thing<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.329> have<00:03:27.540> got<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:27.989> well<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.530> let's

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
thing that you have got as well so let's

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.969 
thing that you have got as well so let's
just<00:03:28.859> go<00:03:28.949> into<00:03:29.189> drama<00:03:29.579> for<00:03:29.849> example<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.560> I

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
just go into drama for example and I

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.379 
just go into drama for example and I
just<00:03:32.159> basically<00:03:32.430> dramatizes<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.239> whole

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
just basically dramatizes your whole

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.210 
just basically dramatizes your whole
image<00:03:33.720> you've<00:03:34.079> also<00:03:34.259> got<00:03:34.439> also<00:03:34.799> always<00:03:35.009> got

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
image you've also got also always got

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.369 
image you've also got also always got
compare<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.479> you<00:03:36.540> hold<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.870> down<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.319> that's

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
compare so you hold it down and that's

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.259 
compare so you hold it down and that's
the<00:03:37.560> original<00:03:37.919> image<00:03:38.009> let<00:03:38.340> go<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.909> that's

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
the original image let go and that's

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.149 
the original image let go and that's
what<00:03:39.389> you've<00:03:39.540> turned<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.049> Sophie<00:03:40.799> looks

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
what you've turned it in to Sophie looks

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.749 
what you've turned it in to Sophie looks
kind<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.459> cool<00:03:41.699> so<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.090> hit<00:03:42.239> apply<00:03:42.449> on<00:03:42.689> that<00:03:43.759> and

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
kind of cool so we hit apply on that and

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.879 
kind of cool so we hit apply on that and
you<00:03:44.939> can<00:03:45.090> change<00:03:45.329> house<00:03:45.599> on<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.500> drum<00:03:46.709> where

you can change house on the drum where
you<00:03:46.949> can<00:03:47.069> change<00:03:47.280> how<00:03:47.400> strong<00:03:47.729> it<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:47.909> as<00:03:48.150> well

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
you can change how strong it is as well

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.710 
you can change how strong it is as well

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.920 
grainy there we go and you can change
that<00:03:59.519> as<00:03:59.639> well<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.359> shuffle<00:04:00.689> through

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that as well and you can shuffle through

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.619 
that as well and you can shuffle through
different<00:04:01.199> grunge<00:04:01.469> effects<00:04:01.829> as<00:04:02.040> well<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:03.269> I

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
different grunge effects as well so I

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.679 
different grunge effects as well so I
think<00:04:04.259> that<00:04:04.439> looks<00:04:04.739> kind<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.250> interesting<00:04:05.689> so

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
think that looks kind of interesting so

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.360 
think that looks kind of interesting so
that<00:04:06.959> looks<00:04:07.019> kind<00:04:07.409> of<00:04:07.500> cool<00:04:07.739> very<00:04:07.979> old-school

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
that looks kind of cool very old-school

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.140
