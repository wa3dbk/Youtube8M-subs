remember<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.610> one<00:00:23.670> though<00:00:25.010> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
remember this one though this is a

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:43.189 
public domain c64 game released in 2000
I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.769> and<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.429> exactly<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.749> it<00:00:42.899> says

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
I think and this is exactly what it says

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.490 
I think and this is exactly what it says
it<00:00:43.409> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800 

apparently<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.530> don't<00:00:50.710> have<00:00:50.860> my<00:00:51.310> joystick<00:00:52.210> sub

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
apparently I don't have my joystick sub

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.970 
apparently I don't have my joystick sub
correctly<00:00:53.410> because<00:00:53.890> why<00:00:54.280> would<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.580> check<00:00:55.000> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
correctly because why would I check that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.150 
correctly because why would I check that
hmm

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
hmm

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:07.200 
hmm
why<00:00:57.640> would<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:58.570> check<00:00:59.230> that<00:01:01.560> there<00:01:02.560> we<00:01:02.650> go<00:01:06.210> yeah

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
why would I check that there we go yeah

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.609 
why would I check that there we go yeah
taking<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.570> little<00:01:07.780> break<00:01:07.990> from<00:01:08.229> one<00:01:08.470> way

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
taking a little break from one way

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.830 
taking a little break from one way
heroics<00:01:09.190> might<00:01:09.970> take<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.150> long<00:01:10.450> break<00:01:10.810> from

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
heroics might take a long break from

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.960 
heroics might take a long break from
that<00:01:11.110> like<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.680> said<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.340> last<00:01:12.460> video<00:01:12.610> is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
that like I said in the last video is

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.359 
that like I said in the last video is
starting<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.360> get<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.540> little<00:01:13.600> sick<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
starting to get a little sick of it but

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.070 
starting to get a little sick of it but
there<00:01:15.520> are<00:01:15.550> still<00:01:15.670> things<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.300> show<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:16.960> do

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
there are still things to show so I do

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.040 
there are still things to show so I do
plan<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.680> come<00:01:17.830> back<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.190> it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
plan to come back to it

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.090 
plan to come back to it
but<00:01:20.050> this<00:01:20.260> I<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.229> felt<00:01:23.410> like<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> should

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
but this I kind of felt like this should

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.350 
but this I kind of felt like this should
be<00:01:24.310> seen<00:01:26.190> also<00:01:27.190> kind<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.580> getting<00:01:27.850> back<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
be seen also kind of getting back to the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.900 
be seen also kind of getting back to the
old<00:01:28.500> actually<00:01:29.820> obscure<00:01:30.820> game<00:01:31.479> thing<00:01:32.170> I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
old actually obscure game thing I

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.340 
old actually obscure game thing I
haven't<00:01:33.910> played<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.840> very<00:01:35.050> long<00:01:35.320> while

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
haven't played this in a very long while

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.420 
haven't played this in a very long while
I<00:01:37.020> only<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.350> remembered<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.860> had<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
I only just remembered that I had it

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.520 
I only just remembered that I had it
when<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.670> was<00:01:39.820> digging<00:01:40.060> through<00:01:40.330> my<00:01:40.509> stuff<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
when I was digging through my stuff so

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.889 
when I was digging through my stuff so
this<00:01:44.649> is<00:01:44.800> probably<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.460> be<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:46.390> pretty

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
this is probably going to be a pretty

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.090 
this is probably going to be a pretty
poor<00:01:47.380> showing<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:50.320> that's<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.680> really<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
poor showing but that's not really the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.300 
poor showing but that's not really the
point<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.610> think<00:01:52.570> most<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.560> probably<00:01:53.740> get

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
point I think most of you probably get

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.980 
point I think most of you probably get
the<00:01:54.490> point<00:01:54.760> just<00:01:55.180> from<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> title<00:01:55.659> screen

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the point just from the title screen

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:13.980 
the point just from the title screen
alone<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.790> how<00:02:00.940> about<00:02:01.030> them<00:02:01.270> c64<00:02:02.140> load<00:02:02.409> times

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:22.890 

I<00:02:20.370> was<00:02:21.370> growing<00:02:21.670> up<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.210> used<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.720> like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
I was growing up I really used to like

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.560 
I was growing up I really used to like
winter<00:02:23.380> games<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.980> play<00:02:24.550> ski<00:02:24.850> jumping<00:02:25.240> all<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
winter games I play ski jumping all the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.350 
winter games I play ski jumping all the
time<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.310> mess<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:27.550> just<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> watch<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
time and mess it up just to watch the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.400 
time and mess it up just to watch the
God<00:02:28.510> bounce<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.200> roll<00:02:29.380> down<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.800> hill<00:02:31.410> well

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
God bounce and roll down the hill well

God bounce and roll down the hill well

I'm getting that is I might actually be

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'm getting that is I might actually be
the<00:02:33.970> target<00:02:34.330> audience<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:34.780> us<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.260> might<00:02:35.740> be

the target audience for us I might be

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
the target audience for us I might be
associate<00:02:36.490> dad
