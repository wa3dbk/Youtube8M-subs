00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.170
 stage 24 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.869
 so I'm going to mention how 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.939
 the console works this console first 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 that nothing has three forms of recording 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.640
 or to operate already the first one that is 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.900
 work with direct channels and other 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.070
 console has 12 channels in the present 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.830
 and has 12 more channels in present is 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.210
 say this console if we work with 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.300
 direct channels works with 24 channels 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.090
 already 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 in the 24 channels are hospitals 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 watching here with the traders and I have the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.829
 sub master of these channels that are in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.039
 on this side that this master up that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.900
 corresponds to those present and master 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.460
 bay that correspond to those below 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.070
 already 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.840
 when I want to work with channel in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.759
 direct you have to select 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.759
 the mode the select button 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.440
 124 thousand that means it's going to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.230
 work with the 24 channels 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.960
 all right 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.230
 here we will see can I learn channel by 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230
 channel 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:44.020
 at the bottom I have channel 13 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.020
 until 24 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.660
 then in select mode 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.450
 the sin 124 and I work with the 24 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.729
 direct channels 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.729
 since this is the way of working 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.729
 manual 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.920
 the other way of working with the console 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.930
 it is in double scene 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.649
 when I work in double wax 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.370
 the top 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.349
 work with channels from 1 to 12 in the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.260
 bottom part also works with 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.459
 channels from 1 to 12 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.129
 then what is it about working in 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.120
 the double wax that I can prepare a 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.819
 dinner upstairs and throw it in the air and while 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 that the first scene is on air I can 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.670
 start preparing the second scene in 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.150
 the part 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.930
 and lower 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.819
 good to do the test 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.709
 to work wherever we need to 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.709
 will change the way we changed 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.730
 double scene 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 if they do not learn from yellow and we're going to 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.280
 do the following work 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.280
 We will work all the ends 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.629
 are the failures of the Canary Islands 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.420
 we will work with the master to 100% 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.670
 which in this case frames like 10 and the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.360
 second offers what we are going to see in zero 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.319
 what does this mean that it is a bester of 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.349
 precept 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.010
 which corresponds to the strong in the 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:24.310
 top that are working with 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.670
 time one hundred percent and be 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.980
 off 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.310
 we are going to raise how to prepare a 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.310
 scene 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.860
 I can not regulate the way I want 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.940
 and that I do not have to air if I want 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.550
 prepare the next scene 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.070
 I prepare it here below upstairs as 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.670
 I said that I have 12 channels and below I have 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.440
 the same 12 channels ie the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.620
 freighter that is here is the same as 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.500
 highlights the channel is the same repair the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.150
 second will be the second scene let's go to the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.769
 bridge that I want to prepare 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.769
 to the air those ends 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.109
 but now I want to enter with this scene 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.570
 of ready the two force master the two 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.570
 together at the same time 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.460
 and I already have the other scene
