this<00:00:09.600> is<00:00:09.720> the<00:00:09.840> famila<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.440> Fokker<00:00:10.650> d7<00:00:10.920> F<00:00:11.340> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
this is the famila the Fokker d7 F and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.600 
this is the famila the Fokker d7 F and
it's<00:00:11.820> BMW<00:00:12.540> engine<00:00:13.460> looking<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.550> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
it's BMW engine looking at the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.370 
it's BMW engine looking at the
checklists<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.270> have<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.990> radiator

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
checklists we have to have the radiator

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.109 
checklists we have to have the radiator
fully<00:00:16.740> open<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.610> altitude

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
fully open we have to have altitude

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.580 
fully open we have to have altitude
throttle<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> zero<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.170> press<00:00:19.320> T<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
throttle to zero and then we press T to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.760 
throttle to zero and then we press T to
start<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> engine<00:00:21.170> first<00:00:22.170> gauge<00:00:22.470> we're<00:00:22.650> gonna

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
start the engine first gauge we're gonna

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.769 
start the engine first gauge we're gonna
look<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> fuel<00:00:23.550> gauge<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
look at is the fuel gauge it's on the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.490 
look at is the fuel gauge it's on the
center<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> fuselage<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:27.110> we<00:00:28.110> also<00:00:28.259> have

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
center of the fuselage here we also have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290 
center of the fuselage here we also have
bullet<00:00:28.830> counters<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.430> our<00:00:29.550> machine<00:00:29.849> guns<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
bullet counters on our machine guns so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.150 
bullet counters on our machine guns so
we<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.540> how<00:00:30.630> many<00:00:30.810> rounds<00:00:31.020> we<00:00:31.290> have<00:00:31.320> left

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.750 

next<00:00:35.160> gauge<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> tachometer<00:00:36.560> max<00:00:37.560> rpm

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
next gauge is the tachometer max rpm

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.930 
next gauge is the tachometer max rpm
1600<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.400> right<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.820> have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
1600 and off to the right here we have

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.120 
1600 and off to the right here we have
our<00:00:42.090> altimeter<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.650> measured<00:00:43.980> in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
our altimeter which is measured in

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.150 
our altimeter which is measured in
meters<00:00:47.720> panning<00:00:48.720> over<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.080> our<00:00:49.230> throttle<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
meters panning over to our throttle and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
meters panning over to our throttle and
altitude<00:00:50.700> control<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.240> the<00:00:51.360> left<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:54.900> can<00:00:55.020> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
altitude control on the left you can see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
altitude control on the left you can see
two<00:00:55.470> throttles<00:00:55.740> from<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> big<00:00:57.000> handle<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.540> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
two throttles from the big handle is the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.390 
two throttles from the big handle is the
engine<00:00:58.530> throttle<00:00:58.830> and<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.040> one<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.310> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
engine throttle and the one with the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.420 
engine throttle and the one with the
smaller<00:00:59.730> handle<00:01:00.150> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.200> altitude<00:01:01.830> throttle

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
smaller handle is the altitude throttle

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
smaller handle is the altitude throttle
this<00:01:02.970> extra<00:01:03.330> altitude<00:01:03.570> throttle<00:01:04.229> here

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this extra altitude throttle here

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
this extra altitude throttle here
essentially<00:01:04.860> gives<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> more<00:01:05.309> engine<00:01:05.610> power

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
essentially gives you more engine power

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.390 
essentially gives you more engine power
different<00:01:06.210> altitudes<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:07.740> breaks<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.159> into

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
different altitudes that breaks up into

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.359 
different altitudes that breaks up into
the<00:01:08.460> thirds<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:09.720> first<00:01:09.960> third<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:11.009> from

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the thirds the first third you use from

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
the thirds the first third you use from
500<00:01:12.270> meters<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> point<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.479> then

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
500 meters that's the point there then

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
500 meters that's the point there then
the<00:01:15.990> second<00:01:16.350> point<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.649> at<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> thousand<00:01:17.249> meters

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the second point is at a thousand meters

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.529 
the second point is at a thousand meters
and<00:01:18.649> then<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.950> next<00:01:20.189> point<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> 1500<00:01:21.210> meters

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
and then the next point is 1500 meters

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.919 
and then the next point is 1500 meters
so<00:01:22.499> just<00:01:22.799> correspond<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:24.210> spot<00:01:24.539> on<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
so just correspond the right spot on to

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.599 
so just correspond the right spot on to
your<00:01:25.079> altitude<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:25.770> adjust<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.460> altitude

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
your altitude and adjust your altitude

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.539 
your altitude and adjust your altitude
control<00:01:27.210> accordingly<00:01:28.170> we're<00:01:29.159> taking<00:01:29.460> off

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
control accordingly we're taking off

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.849 
control accordingly we're taking off
though<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.999> we<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.539> after<00:01:31.499> your

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
though so we want that after your

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.230 
though so we want that after your
control<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.399> zero<00:01:32.869> alright<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.109> we<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
I'm starting it up of the compass and

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.569
