 The staff got me there because I did not 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.410

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.039
 of the galera in twitter that marked job 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 worse is vice president of windows 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.380
 phone is landmark several people there are people 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.750
 great on the windows phone to bring 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.820
 whatsapp back what she was freaking out 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.649
 So, I'm glad you came back with 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.770
 various enhancements with various 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.250
 bugs with multiple features added and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.050
 Let's see this now in the review. Let's go. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 all beauty guys are happy with 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.660
 back from the challenge because it is yesterday 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.500
 and whatsapp has been released yet in the new 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.090
 version 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 Remember, I mentioned the previous video. 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 that I posted here on the channel about the challenge 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 that before us an old version does not 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.940
 is a beta version of only 89 megs 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 approximately now this new version 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.759
 has double the size 17 megs 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.869
 approximately the application had several 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.250
 improvements 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.330
 so I saw this version that was 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.670
 released she had several improvements she had 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.610
 several features added plus one 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.039
 thing I realized is that since I use the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.190
 whatsapp beta example here 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:10.780
 is the beta version and here is the version that 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.160
 was released yesterday 30 is one of the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 The things I noticed here is that by 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.380
 example the beta version you can change the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.200
 background for each beauty contact 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.080
 and already 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.730
 Yesterday you still do not have this option to 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.769
 difference 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 this was the main function I noticed 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.040
 for a thousand that's what I noticed 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.680
 different 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.400
 Let's now know the collection is from 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.220
 whatsapp is not the improvements they have had 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.800
 everything else is running faster 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.000
 It's much faster now you can 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 that there is this difference there are 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.650
 the contacts or all contacts the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.260
 conversations and everything else 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.739
 here are options for finding contacts 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.620
 add contact or add groups 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.870
 here you have the transition list that is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.260
 where you can send a message 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.239
 voice to multiple contacts the same 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.880
 message to multiple contacts and this is 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.549
 very cool also in settings here 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.620
 Let's see what settings are cool. 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.610
 what is the on the application is support and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.250
 everything else 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.620
 contacts you can block has a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.410
 block of contact and your profile 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.250
 that you can now customize the phrase 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.620
 huh 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.380
 I put that there are numerous phone not 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.950
 to be the nih 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.440
 here is the photo that you can change it 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.630
 beauty profile is not my account is 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.079
 For all of life , it's nice now. 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.319
 There are plenty of conversations here. 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.549
 options such as the inter 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.060
 beyond the keyboard to send the message 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.690
 I do not like this shows the message 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.769
 notifications on the default background 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.519
 you have these options there the cool of 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.519
 choose here 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:23.050
 is then you have these options right there seek 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 on the web chosen album the gallery of 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.190
 funds here someone some some 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.180
 some hol peppers you add are 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.100
 size of text you can 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.810
 you can also activate the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.030
 which I have a contract here 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.070
 the narrator only works in the English language 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.290
 still equip cortana fast start 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.690

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.900
 1 to anyone who sees evil where it is O 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.900
 quite interesting 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.240
 I'm not blind download automatic 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.080
 files is one thing I realized 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.080
 it's still not possible to import 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.250
 music also still lack it then right 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.200
 more here 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.720
 but for example someone here and even a 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.080
 twitter set thing going to them brief 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.580
 then release a version in the store but 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.380
 are still working on the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.810
 beta to conclude right? 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.730
 still because it really is a lot of work 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.860
 I develop an application for you and the 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.580
 application currently used or 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.100
 I believe then download automatic 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:39.220
 on that day the backup that always when 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:41.220
 you are is exercising the detachment of your 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.720
 conversations 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.780

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.430
 how can you see this beautiful screen right? 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.590
 thing that I also realized that wants 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.690

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.820

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.600
 Different now I just realized it today 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.669

 not to use the accelerometer is 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:09.159
