00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.230 
some green and I just wanted that
yesterday<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:05.310> looks<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.820> rubbish

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
yesterday so it looks a little rubbish

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.700 
yesterday so it looks a little rubbish
okay<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> plants<00:02:07.680> are

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
okay right now because the plants are

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.859 
okay right now because the plants are
probably<00:02:08.039> stress<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> everything<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
probably stress and everything but in a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.100 
probably stress and everything but in a
couple<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> weeks<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.709> gonna<00:02:10.830> be

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
couple of weeks this is gonna be

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.150 
couple of weeks this is gonna be
lush<00:02:11.440> garden<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.690> that's<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> first<00:02:14.830> line<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
lush garden so that's the first line you

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.790 
lush garden so that's the first line you
can<00:02:15.310> put<00:02:15.520> with<00:02:15.970> Malawi<00:02:16.270> cichlids<00:02:16.810> or<00:02:17.590> any

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
can put with Malawi cichlids or any

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.670 
can put with Malawi cichlids or any
other<00:02:18.070> sequence<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:20.170> we're<00:02:20.290> gonna<00:02:20.440> move

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
other sequence but now we're gonna move

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.170 
other sequence but now we're gonna move
on<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.940> plant<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.990> Tanganyika<00:02:23.590> tank<00:02:24.180> now

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
on to my plant the Tanganyika tank now

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.480 
on to my plant the Tanganyika tank now
in<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.810> tank<00:02:26.020> there's<00:02:26.260> some<00:02:26.500> times<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.890> if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
in this tank there's some times that if

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.880 
in this tank there's some times that if
you<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.760> herbivores<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:28.870> will<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.500> eaten

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you have herbivores they will get eaten

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.690 
you have herbivores they will get eaten
but<00:02:30.550> with<00:02:30.700> tagging<00:02:31.150> Eakins<00:02:32.250> these<00:02:33.250> plants

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
but with tagging Eakins these plants

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.910 
but with tagging Eakins these plants
will<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:34.030> really<00:02:34.420> nice<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.840> mean<00:02:35.380> Tanganyika

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
will be really nice I mean Tanganyika

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.050 
will be really nice I mean Tanganyika
star<00:02:36.130> aren't<00:02:36.400> herbivores

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
star aren't herbivores

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.870 
star aren't herbivores
obviously<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.750> dosas<00:02:38.340> any<00:02:39.340> lamp<00:02:39.700> role

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
obviously like from dosas any lamp role

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.840 
obviously like from dosas any lamp role
August<00:02:40.330> aren't<00:02:41.290> gonna<00:02:41.470> touch<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.950> either<00:02:42.160> so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
August aren't gonna touch it either so

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.880 
August aren't gonna touch it either so
you<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.540> put<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.840> with<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.440> they

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you can put it with that and they

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.260 
you can put it with that and they
tolerate<00:02:45.370> hard<00:02:45.730> pH<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.520> frizzy

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
tolerate hard pH so there is frizzy

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.979 
tolerate hard pH so there is frizzy
Devon<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.780> nana<00:02:50.050> yeah<00:02:50.230> that's<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.190> big<00:02:51.370> one

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
Devon is nana yeah that's the big one

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.130 
Devon is nana yeah that's the big one
the<00:02:52.989> long<00:02:53.200> leaves<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.280> way<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.489> back

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the long leaves all the way in the back

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.500 
the long leaves all the way in the back
it<00:02:56.140> was<00:02:56.350> fairly<00:02:56.770> nicely<00:02:57.130> with<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.000> plant<00:02:58.300> I

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it was fairly nicely with this plant I

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.720 
it was fairly nicely with this plant I
found<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.040> beginning<00:03:00.190> when<00:03:00.640> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
found out that in the beginning when you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.460 
found out that in the beginning when you
first<00:03:00.940> granted<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:01.900> gonna<00:03:02.050> get<00:03:02.290> worse

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
first granted it's gonna get worse

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.390 
first granted it's gonna get worse
before<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.890> gets<00:03:03.010> better

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
before it gets better

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.840 
before it gets better
meaning<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.540> will<00:03:04.630> lose<00:03:04.900> most<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.440> its<00:03:05.590> leaves

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
meaning it will lose most of its leaves

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.570 
meaning it will lose most of its leaves
but<00:03:06.850> leave<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.900> roots<00:03:08.170> inside<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.040> sand<00:03:09.310> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
but leave the roots inside the sand and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.430 
but leave the roots inside the sand and
eventually<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.300> gonna<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.080> know<00:03:11.200> make<00:03:11.380> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
eventually it's gonna you know make a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.710 
eventually it's gonna you know make a
nice<00:03:11.709> root<00:03:12.040> system<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.820> then<00:03:13.150> pick<00:03:13.450> up<00:03:13.570> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
nice root system and then pick up the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.140 
nice root system and then pick up the
energy<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.200> make<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.070> beautiful<00:03:15.310> plant<00:03:15.820> so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
energy in make a beautiful plant so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.180 
energy in make a beautiful plant so
don't<00:03:16.510> get<00:03:16.900> discouraged<00:03:17.049> if<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.860> start

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
have they're eventually like you see in

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.390 
have they're eventually like you see in
the<00:03:24.970> middle<00:03:25.410> starts<00:03:26.410> growing<00:03:26.650> all<00:03:26.890> back<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the middle starts growing all back and

gives<00:03:58.989> more<00:03:59.200> nutrients<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.950> the<00:03:59.980> ferns<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.610> its

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
gives more nutrients to the ferns if its

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.570 
gives more nutrients to the ferns if its
place<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.269> wood<00:04:01.480> rather<00:04:01.810> than<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.320> rocks<00:04:02.680> so

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
place the wood rather than on rocks so

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.810 
place the wood rather than on rocks so
here<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> type<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.510> fern<00:04:06.540> java<00:04:07.540> moss

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
here is like the type of fern java moss

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.370 
here is like the type of fern java moss
if<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:10.000> put<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.299> on<00:04:10.390> wood<00:04:10.660> it's<00:04:10.900> gonna<00:04:11.110> take

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
if you put it on wood it's gonna take

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.470 
if you put it on wood it's gonna take
approximately<00:04:12.130> one<00:04:12.459> month<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.970> two

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
approximately one month and two

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.240

takes<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.410> while<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.590> grow<00:04:44.979> but<00:04:45.430> give<00:04:45.669> it<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.880> lot

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
takes a while to grow but give it a lot

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.010 
takes a while to grow but give it a lot
of<00:04:46.120> iron<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:47.040> it's<00:04:48.040> gonna<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.430> really<00:04:48.669> nicely

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
of iron and it's gonna be really nicely
