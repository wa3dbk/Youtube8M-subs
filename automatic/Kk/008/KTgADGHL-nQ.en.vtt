00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 Greetings to all Pieris's friends 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.610
 collection types from hector today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 I'm here with you to show you the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.369
 collector's edition of tales of xillia 2 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 for playstation 3 called rudiger 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 this is the kreshnik collector edition 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 limited version arrived in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.890
 European territory 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 this is in any case if the box is presented 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 on the front of powers between the images of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.539
 very very voluminous side as a box 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.539
 now we will see all the various contents 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.539
 then on the back we can first 

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:49.850
 admire three screenshots of the game 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.749
 we can also see that the game is 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 this collection was completely 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.369
 multilingual so it is destined for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.139
 European territory in its entirety 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.739
 we are also Italian in the end how 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.209
 language and basically we have the description 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 of all the various contents we will find 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.810
 inside of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 then we have the game disc plus the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 soundtrack is a metal that the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 detail designed precisely for per 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 this collector's edition 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.979
 then we have an action figure of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.149
 an artbook protagonist of 20 centimeters 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 and his xillia is more like a mirror 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.729
 portable mirror actually replicates the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 stamped joe from pocket that is in the game 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.939
 however in reality unfortunately neither a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.719
 pocket watch does not fit 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.130
 portable mirror then the contents 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.109
 prepared on the side that I do 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 see a little at a time 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.109
 first of all note that the game does 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.219
 presents only in this way that is 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.880
 there is no standard version like 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.170
 shown at least in the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.329
 in the various contents gives the impression 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.520
 precisely that there was both the cover 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.020
 standard that the metal cover given 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.329
 precisely with this limited edition 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 instead in reality there is only 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.439
 this cover limited the point of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.600
 classic metal bastille 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:10.000
 the book and inside we simply have 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.050
 the blue ray of play the usual muscoletto 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.750
 of the namco bandai blue dot game 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.280
 ray that snares 2 and the soundtrack 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 original 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.260
 nothing else pertains to the game 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.540
 aside instead inside the box 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.209
 we have the usual handbook is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.530
 multilingual present more or less in all 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 European collectors including also 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 with the language there is also Italian though 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 unfortunately it is very few pages 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.019
 right informative title for what 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.260
 regards the game controls then the art 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:53.140
 book looks like this is 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:57.190
 very large and paginated practice vi 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 I show more or less what 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.430
 contains are the usual illustrations 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 all the various characters with drawings 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.340
 preparatory sketches and whatever else 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.329
 description of ships as registration of one 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.519
 of them all in English 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.720
 obviously we find also precisely i 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.549
 protagonists of the first tales of xillia 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.560
 because in any case this is a true following 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.450
 and proper of the events of the first that the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.060
 his xillia I remember he always came out alone 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.670
 on playstation 3 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.430
 and this with regard to the later 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.810
 we have that mirror we say clock 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.260
 laptop in the game and a clock 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.430
 beard portals have the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.100
 protagonist is a pocket watch 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.650
 classic pocket watch that 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.329
 apparently it is very very nice 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.459
 you see that there is a kind of inside 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:50.620
 here is the description of the other one to import it 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.280
 namco bandai artifact law there is written 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.030
 as well as classic made in China has made the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.660
 namco bandai 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.840
 we also have this species of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.490
 the bag that would contain it 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.210
 precisely this is the clock in question 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:10.170
 own foxes marked mirror 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.350
 see if it is crushed it opens and there is inside 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.580
 just a mirror plus a replica of the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.570
 of the clock that has the protagonist in 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.459
 a game all in metal really 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.020
 very well done 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.510
 nice as the utility is next 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.890
 at zero 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.010
 for this with regard to these 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.490
 bridge in a fu then finally we have the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.790
 the figure of the protagonist nude for will 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.930
 plecnik indeed very similar to that 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.420
 that we had seen in the in 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.510
 collector's precedence of tales of 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.400
 xillia and will find a thousand maxwell 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.010
 we have just a protagonist 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.050
 male here he is prepared everything 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.700
 but I do show to the occurrence 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:00.840
 I try to show it the best it has done 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.540
 fairly well below we have the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.540
 usual writing made in china 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.550
 soon it was created by 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.290
 banque rest all in all it is not is not 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.990
 evil is very similar though 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.910
 to the in-game counterpart protagonist e 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.250
 this is what concerns all 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.220
 contents of this collector's edition 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.130
