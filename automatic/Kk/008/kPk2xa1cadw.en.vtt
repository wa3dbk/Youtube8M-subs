00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.270
 I want the basis of everything is to have some 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.210
 super Suarez hands and we just 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.100
 discover something that you really leave them 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.680
 beautiful thing is not like an exfoliant 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.780
 casual that you buy it I do not know maybe 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.839
 this leaves you super hands 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.790
 lovely beautiful soft so you 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.519
 I will teach how to have more hands 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.650
 soft and envy them all over the county 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.629
 in relation to being so beautiful they are 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.699
 beautiful and from the quemero of the hands 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.559
 I get tired for precious and everyone tells me 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.540
 you wear the skin that looks beautiful 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.519
 and those things and I will have my 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.799
 secret and then let's start with 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.930
 the tutorial is not pure we are going to make a 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.540
 manicure in five steps with recipes 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.270
 made in caste prepare your hands you have 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 which is to paint your nails rinse and the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.649
 you have to leave super clean me in 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.689
 this time I have it obviously false 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.560
 I know that many of you hear them 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.450
 I also hate them 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.399
 but because it is what is after me 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 I'll quote first first let's make a 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.350
 almond milk scrub 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.920
 You need 3 tablespoons of milk 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 almonds 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.810
 and a spoonful of honey 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.350
 a spoonful of plain yogurt 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 a spoonful of natural cornstarch 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.700
 what we have to do is mix everything 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.130
 in a dish until it is done as a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.560
 pasta if it is very liquid add more 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.320
 cornstarch and if it's solid add more 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.780
 almond milk 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.290
 let's let the pasta rest for about 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.290
 5 minutes 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.509
 and easier by all your hands 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.900
 let's let it act for two minutes and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.480
 in the feeling that I leave you are more 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 Handle is that you have super hands 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 clean you really feel your hands 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.570
 very clean now let's make a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.440
 exfoliant that is really my favorite 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.080
 of favorites 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.570
 You need half a tablespoon of oil 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.240
 extra virgin olive a spoonful of 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.420
 baking soda the juice of half 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.420
 lemon 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.080
 and a teaspoon of sugar we are going to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.740
 mix everything very well we throw the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.990
 baking at the end 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.550
 and with a toothbrush can be 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.950
 that you no longer use the faithful anymore 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.990
 specials you buy a new one and what 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.270
 we have to do is brush around 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.850
 your nails to detach the cells from 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.410
 dead skin and dirt then what 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.270
 what's left you can put it all 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.620
 your hands I have it in the words 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.020
 to register but really this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.550
 Mask leaves skin super soft 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.530
 it can be me on your feet in your 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
 body fascinates me in fact it is me 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.690
 I think it's my favorite scrub of the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.600
 lifetime 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.790
 and step number 3 is that we're going to super his 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 budget to improve our cream 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.660
 moisturizer in her cup of water 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.270
 boiling to your interest but very 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.520
 concentrated using two or three bags leave 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.830
 to cool down and serve two tablespoons 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.100
 add three tablespoons of your cream 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.100
 humectant 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.020
 and two drops of coconut oil 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.590
 d 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.719
 let's cover our hands by 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.609
 complete with this mix and post 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.150
 we continue in our hands as if they were 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.150
 gloves 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.790
 I want that with them a half hour 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.490
 You can see a chapter of your series 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.890
 favorite I do not know a thing the TV in my 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.690
 videos for example and already remove the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.880
 socks if I feel my hands like 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.740
 Super greasy excess removes with a 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.710
 towel but without carving very strong 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.930
 I slowly touch and now the following 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.640
 steps would be that you paint your nails or 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.440
 the things that you like the most there are many 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.330
 people who recommend you take the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.280
 cuticles because I do not want to get into 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.900
 these issues because I'm not an expert by 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 I do not have wood, I have 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.230
 one metal that looks a bit violent 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.360
 because it's very good to me I like that the 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.700
 pintauÃ±as is super powerful so 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.160
 you can paint a base layer and then 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.600
 you put another layer and then another layer 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.340
 until it remains with the intensity that you 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.990
 like and always add a layer 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.090
 Transparent up 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.580
 if you have almond oil put two 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.500
 droplets, your cuticles will be moisturized and 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.540
 apart you will last much more the color 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.420
 the colors that are in this season 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.620
 they are burnt oranges and the crisis' 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.750
 action came the blues like dark anise 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.210
 and it 's all hands that are going to be 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.890
 beautiful I give you the super scientist you 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.820
 they will look beautiful to me I love them 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.950

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.360
 skin if you do not get lazy I love you 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.100
 you can put your legs and in 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.330
 you're really going to see super cool in 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.530
 any part of the body you 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.420

 They know that they motivate me a lot and here 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.210
 is 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.470
 we do not have Friday with a tutorial 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.120
 that is going to be great is something of the 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.710

 there are always who says can be friends 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.120
 after finishing a relationship I say 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.860
 that we can all be friends but not 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.180
 You have to be friends with someone with 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.220
 who do not feel comfortable that the 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.320
 sets that go as with the same 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:05.690
 stamping are a very very trend 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.690
 strong for this season I have some 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:18.709
 it's not like an exfoliant to wear it and if 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.709
 you see me
