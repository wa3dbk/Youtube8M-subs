but<00:00:39.210> those<00:00:39.420> aren't<00:00:39.660> Martians<00:00:40.079> running<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.500> us

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but those aren't Martians running at us

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.619 
but those aren't Martians running at us
we'll<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> gray<00:00:42.030> rock<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> good

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
we'll have to put this gray rock to good

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.150 
we'll have to put this gray rock to good
use<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.260> full<00:00:43.469> advantage<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
use and take full advantage of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459 
use and take full advantage of the
weapons<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.640> items<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:45.180> our<00:00:45.300> disposal<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.410> i'm

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
weapons and items at our disposal so i'm

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.400 
weapons and items at our disposal so i'm
guessing<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> gray<00:00:47.010> rock<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> 115<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.870> uh<00:00:48.899> if

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
guessing the gray rock is 115 but uh if

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
guessing the gray rock is 115 but uh if
we're<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> make<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.070> alive<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.640> while

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we're to make it out alive and while

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.610 
we're to make it out alive and while
we're<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.260> things<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we're here there are some things that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
we're here there are some things that
need<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.010> taken<00:00:53.219> care<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.579> once<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> for

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
need to be taken care of once and for

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.619 
need to be taken care of once and for
all<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> i'm<00:00:55.710> assuming<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.219> that's

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
all so i'm assuming that that's

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
all so i'm assuming that that's
Richthofen<00:00:57.629> speaking<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.670> little

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
picture for you to look at but uh on to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.109 
picture for you to look at but uh on to

Richthofen 2 grand scheme so of course

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.890 
Richthofen 2 grand scheme so of course
no<00:01:12.510> doubt<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> easter<00:01:14.100> egg

no doubt that's that's the easter egg

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.300 
no doubt that's that's the easter egg
it's<00:01:15.900> probably<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.950> huge

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's probably going to be huge

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
it's probably going to be huge
considering<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.659> Rick<00:01:18.869> self-ins

terminal like the head or what that's
going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.360> definitely<00:01:51.360> something

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
going to be definitely something

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.350 
going to be definitely something
interesting<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.000> giant

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
interesting to see and then one giant

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.870 
interesting to see and then one giant
leap<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.780> 5<00:01:54.990> gamerscore<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.829> moon<00:01:56.460> become

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
leap it's 5 gamerscore and moon become

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.670 
leap it's 5 gamerscore and moon become
trapped<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> receiving<00:01:57.840> area<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.469> for

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
trapped in the receiving area and for

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.670 
trapped in the receiving area and for
yourself<00:01:59.100> through<00:01:59.280> resurrection<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> co-op

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
yourself through resurrection and co-op

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
yourself through resurrection and co-op
so<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> co-op<00:02:02.310> achievement<00:02:02.880> I'm

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so that's a co-op achievement I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.469 
so that's a co-op achievement I'm
assuming<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.460> receiving<00:02:05.969> area<00:02:06.210> would

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
assuming that the receiving area would

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.070 
assuming that the receiving area would
be<00:02:06.540> area<00:02:07.020> 51

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
be area 51

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.170 
be area 51
you<00:02:09.619> get<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.009> through<00:02:10.250> teleporting<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.090> it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
you get there through teleporting but it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.180 
you get there through teleporting but it
has<00:02:11.360> become<00:02:11.690> trapped<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.930> real<00:02:15.140> sure

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
has become trapped so I'm not real sure

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.680 
has become trapped so I'm not real sure
what<00:02:16.190> exactly<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.670> means<00:02:16.820> like<00:02:17.270> how<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
what exactly that means like how do you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.020 
what exactly that means like how do you
get<00:02:17.810> trapped<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.320> in<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.830> area<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.850> says

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
get trapped in in that area and it says

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.450 
get trapped in in that area and it says
free<00:02:20.630> yourself<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.110> resurrection<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:22.280> if<00:02:22.370> you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
free yourself to resurrection but if you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.980 
free yourself to resurrection but if you
notice<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:22.910> public<00:02:23.270> them<00:02:23.390> has<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.840> not

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
notice it's public them has it's not

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.540 
notice it's public them has it's not
spelled<00:02:24.290> with<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> sea<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.130> map<00:02:25.310> pack

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
spelled with the sea like the map pack

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.630 
spelled with the sea like the map pack
it<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:27.100> don't<00:02:28.100> know<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.370> there's<00:02:28.520> going

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
it is so I don't know if there's going

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.010 
it is so I don't know if there's going
to<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:28.760> one<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.000> those<00:02:29.090> hard<00:02:29.390> things<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.840> do

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
to be one of those hard things to do

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300 
to be one of those hard things to do
what<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:31.490> perks<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.510> space<00:02:32.920> 30<00:02:33.920> Amber's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
what but perks and space 30 Amber's

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.160 
what but perks and space 30 Amber's
court<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.760> moon<00:02:34.940> purchase<00:02:35.390> every<00:02:35.750> perk<00:02:35.990> in

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
one game so I'm wondering if that means

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.980 
one game so I'm wondering if that means
that<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.530> got<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.790> buy<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:41.330> perks<00:02:41.600> go

that you got to buy the for perks go

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.610 
that you got to buy the for perks go
down<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:43.340> by<00:02:43.610> different<00:02:44.600> ones<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.530> know

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
down and then by different ones you know

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.070 
down and then by different ones you know
what<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:45.770> mean<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.820> something<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.300> but

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
what I mean or something like that but

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.980 
what I mean or something like that but
and<00:02:49.060> unless<00:02:50.060> there's<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.390> way<00:02:50.630> where<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.900> can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
and unless there's a way where you can

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.900 
and unless there's a way where you can
actually<00:02:51.260> buy<00:02:51.530> at<00:02:51.709> all<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.100> know<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.670> heard

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.780 
actually buy at all I know I heard
somebody<00:02:53.180> mentioned<00:02:53.750> once<00:02:53.930> before<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.790> you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
somebody mentioned once before that you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.720 
somebody mentioned once before that you
know<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> fifth<00:02:56.270> /<00:02:56.540> cost<00:02:57.160> five<00:02:58.160> times<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
know the fifth / cost five times the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.180 
know the fifth / cost five times the
money<00:02:58.760> six<00:02:59.660> perks<00:02:59.930> cause<00:03:00.320> six<00:03:00.680> times<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
money six perks cause six times the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.490 
money six perks cause six times the
money<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.670> stuff<00:03:02.600> like<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.080> that's

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
money and stuff like that so that's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.660 
money and stuff like that so that's
definitely<00:03:03.830> going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.250> something<00:03:04.490> else

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
definitely going to be something else

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.730 
definitely going to be something else
interesting<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.240> see<00:03:05.420> fully<00:03:06.230> armed<00:03:06.680> and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
interesting to see fully armed and

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.770 
interesting to see fully armed and
operational<00:03:06.890> 25<00:03:07.880> gamerscore<00:03:08.240> him<00:03:08.630> then

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
operational 25 gamerscore him then

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.570 
operational 25 gamerscore him then
acquired<00:03:09.200> three<00:03:09.530> pack<00:03:09.740> a<00:03:09.770> punch<00:03:10.070> weapons<00:03:10.459> at

acquired three pack a punch weapons at
the<00:03:10.640> same<00:03:10.880> time<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.990> this<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.040> definitely<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
the same time so this is definitely the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.130 
the same time so this is definitely the
big<00:03:14.060> clue<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.950> basically<00:03:16.600> telling<00:03:17.600> us<00:03:17.870> what

this<00:03:28.489> will<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:28.940> mean<00:03:29.239> less<00:03:29.709> máximos<00:03:30.709> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
this will this mean less máximos you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.330 
this will this mean less máximos you
know<00:03:31.310> less<00:03:31.550> insta<00:03:32.030> kills<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.350> will<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.920> actual

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
know less insta kills so will the actual

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.810 
know less insta kills so will the actual
will<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.209> actually<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.720> worth<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.080> payoff<00:03:36.320> and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
will it actually be worth the payoff and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.110 
will it actually be worth the payoff and
in<00:03:37.820> terms<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.769> mean<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.459> way<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.700> meet

in terms of that I mean in a way to meet

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.580 
in terms of that I mean in a way to meet
will<00:03:41.300> because<00:03:41.630> you'll<00:03:41.780> be<00:03:41.900> able<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.140> keep<00:03:42.320> your
