of fallen by the wayside i would hope

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
of fallen by the wayside i would hope
that<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.880> happened<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.479> stuff<00:01:57.780> packs

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that would have happened to stuff packs

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.520 
that would have happened to stuff packs
too<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.649> looks<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.640> no<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.290> case

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
too but looks like no it's not the case

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.330 
too but looks like no it's not the case
and<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.549> makes<00:02:02.909> me<00:02:03.119> upset<00:02:04.040> unless<00:02:05.040> stuff

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and that makes me upset unless stuff

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
and that makes me upset unless stuff
packs<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> sims<00:02:06.390> 4<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.049> much

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
packs for the sims 4 will be much

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
packs for the sims 4 will be much
cheaper<00:02:07.409> than<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> sims<00:02:08.640> 3<00:02:09.000> stuff<00:02:09.479> packs

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
cheaper than the sims 3 stuff packs

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
cheaper than the sims 3 stuff packs
there's<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:11.009> much<00:02:11.220> point<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> them

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
there's really not much point to them

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.570 
there's really not much point to them
because<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:13.170> our

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
because like we have our

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.280 
because like we have our
game<00:02:13.970> pack<00:02:14.180> already<00:02:14.420> which<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.840> twenty

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
game pack already which is twenty

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.980 
game pack already which is twenty
dollars<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.820> added<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.270> lot<00:02:17.420> more<00:02:17.480> value

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
dollars and it added a lot more value

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.970 
dollars and it added a lot more value
for<00:02:18.170> our<00:02:18.230> money<00:02:18.470> where<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.740> actually

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
for our money where it actually

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.430 
for our money where it actually
contained<00:02:19.640> new<00:02:20.150> gameplay<00:02:20.720> elements<00:02:21.290> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
contained new gameplay elements and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.700 
contained new gameplay elements and
stuff<00:02:22.430> packs<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.450> sims<00:02:23.690> 3<00:02:24.020> cost<00:02:24.350> twenty

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
stuff packs for the sims 3 cost twenty

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.080 
stuff packs for the sims 3 cost twenty
dollars<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:26.200> yeah<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.100> be<00:02:28.250> weird<00:02:28.460> for<00:02:28.670> EA

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
dollars so yeah it would be weird for EA

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.040 
dollars so yeah it would be weird for EA
to<00:02:29.270> price<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.460> stuff<00:02:31.460> pack<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.120> same<00:02:32.450> as<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> game

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
to price a stuff pack the same as a game

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.100 
to price a stuff pack the same as a game
pack<00:02:33.410> that's<00:02:34.130> definitely<00:02:34.700> not<00:02:35.210> something<00:02:35.600> EA

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
pack that's definitely not something EA

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.250 
pack that's definitely not something EA
would<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.710> away<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.570> not<00:02:38.840> just

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
would get away with but it's not just

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.100 
would get away with but it's not just
the<00:02:39.620> whole<00:02:39.830> oea<00:02:40.640> wants<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.420> nickel<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.900> dime

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the whole oea wants to nickel and dime

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.260 
the whole oea wants to nickel and dime

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
us for as much money as possible it's

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.440 
us for as much money as possible it's
also<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.280> all<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.640> effort<00:02:47.210> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
also that like with all the effort the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.150 
also that like with all the effort the
budget<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.170> they're<00:02:48.350> putting<00:02:48.680> into<00:02:48.800> stuff

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
budget that they're putting into stuff

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.000 
budget that they're putting into stuff
packs<00:02:49.430> why<00:02:50.210> not<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:50.720> use<00:02:51.080> all<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.800> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
packs why not just use all of that to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.010 
packs why not just use all of that to
make<00:02:52.160> more<00:02:52.550> game<00:02:52.850> packs<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.420> mean<00:02:53.660> outdoor

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
make more game packs I mean outdoor

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.470 
make more game packs I mean outdoor
retreat<00:02:54.350> was<00:02:54.620> pretty<00:02:54.890> well<00:02:55.100> received<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.880> I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
retreat was pretty well received and I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.570 
retreat was pretty well received and I
think<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:57.080> with<00:02:57.380> stuff<00:02:57.740> packs<00:02:58.010> competing

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
think that with stuff packs competing

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.699 
think that with stuff packs competing
against<00:02:58.970> both<00:02:59.300> game<00:02:59.660> packs<00:02:59.959> an<00:03:00.200> expansion

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
against both game packs an expansion

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.800 
against both game packs an expansion
packs<00:03:00.920> stuff<00:03:01.310> packs<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> sims<00:03:02.330> 4<00:03:02.450> might

packs stuff packs for the sims 4 might
actually<00:03:03.020> sell<00:03:03.500> pretty<00:03:03.950> poorly<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
actually sell pretty poorly as for the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.560 
actually sell pretty poorly as for the
theme<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.860> stuff<00:03:07.070> pack<00:03:07.280> itself<00:03:07.760> luxury

would appeal more to sort of like the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.949 
would appeal more to sort of like the
lower<00:03:30.350> end<00:03:30.769> like<00:03:31.760> they<00:03:31.970> always<00:03:32.300> appeal<00:03:32.750> to

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
lower end like they always appeal to

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.530 
lower end like they always appeal to
middle<00:03:33.260> class<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> high<00:03:34.160> class<00:03:34.489> how<00:03:35.209> about

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
like I don't know what it would be

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.720 
like I don't know what it would be
called<00:03:38.750> maybe<00:03:39.739> that's<00:03:40.010> partly<00:03:40.370> why<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
called maybe that's partly why it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.580 
called maybe that's partly why it
doesn't<00:03:41.209> exist<00:03:41.450> yet<00:03:41.600> but<00:03:41.870> just<00:03:42.019> like<00:03:42.200> some

furniture<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.380> would<00:03:51.500> be<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> nice

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
furniture like that would be a nice

change<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.580> pace<00:03:52.640> for<00:03:53.060> once<00:03:53.330> if<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.950> was<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.400> one

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
change of pace for once if I was the one

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.790 
change of pace for once if I was the one
deciding<00:03:56.000> what<00:03:56.480> stuff<00:03:56.810> pack<00:03:57.110> was<00:03:57.350> coming<00:03:57.680> out

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
deciding what stuff pack was coming out

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.449 
deciding what stuff pack was coming out
first<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.459> would<00:03:59.120> maybe<00:03:59.480> make<00:03:59.600> one<00:04:00.110> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
first I would maybe make one that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.400

fun<00:04:06.110> stuff<00:04:06.410> for<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.739> sims<00:04:06.980> 2<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.250> think<00:04:07.459> that's

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
fun stuff for the sims 2 I think that's

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.539 
fun stuff for the sims 2 I think that's
a<00:04:07.850> good<00:04:08.000> choice<00:04:08.209> because<00:04:08.510> yeah<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.950> kids

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
a good choice because yeah like kids

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.100 
a good choice because yeah like kids
usually<00:04:10.820> don't<00:04:11.299> get<00:04:11.420> as<00:04:11.570> much<00:04:11.690> stuff<00:04:11.989> in

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
usually don't get as much stuff in

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.410 
usually don't get as much stuff in
comparison<00:04:12.830> to<00:04:13.400> teenagers<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.239> young<00:04:14.360> adults

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
comparison to teenagers and young adults

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.030 
comparison to teenagers and young adults
and<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:16.220> not<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.180> bad<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.019> sims<00:04:18.290> 4<00:04:18.470> but<00:04:19.010> I

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
and it's not as bad in the sims 4 but I

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.229 
and it's not as bad in the sims 4 but I
think<00:04:19.310> kids<00:04:19.580> could<00:04:19.790> always<00:04:20.000> use<00:04:20.209> more

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
think kids could always use more

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.719 
think kids could always use more
clothing<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.109> hair<00:04:21.260> styles<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.979> at<00:04:22.610> least

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
clothing and hair styles and at least

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.430 
clothing and hair styles and at least
would<00:04:22.910> be<00:04:23.030> something<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.750> help<00:04:23.870> tide<00:04:24.140> us<00:04:24.289> over

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
would be something to help tide us over

would be something to help tide us over
until<00:04:24.620> whenever
