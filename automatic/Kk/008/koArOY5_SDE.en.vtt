and<00:01:51.409> fire<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.219> think<00:01:52.429> it<00:01:52.520> looks<00:01:52.670> really

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
and fire and I think it looks really

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.340 
and fire and I think it looks really
awesome<00:01:53.119> obviously<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.840> changed<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.200> house

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
awesome obviously it changed the house

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.279 
awesome obviously it changed the house
to<00:01:54.679> make<00:01:54.859> it<00:01:55.009> less<00:01:55.189> flammable<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.140> know<00:01:57.259> I

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
to make it less flammable so you know I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.690 
to make it less flammable so you know I
had<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.469> change<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:57.859> stone<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:58.369> stuff<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
had to change it to stone and stuff so I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.849 
had to change it to stone and stuff so I
think<00:01:58.789> looks<00:01:59.000> cooler<00:01:59.210> like<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.630> yeah<00:02:00.619> so

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
think looks cooler like that yeah so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.080 
think looks cooler like that yeah so
let's<00:02:01.009> go<00:02:01.100> ahead<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.460> know<00:02:01.549> start<00:02:02.000> from

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
let's go ahead and you know start from

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.669 
let's go ahead and you know start from
the<00:02:02.179> top<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:02.539> this<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> staircase<00:02:03.109> pretty

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
the top so this is a staircase pretty

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.739 
the top so this is a staircase pretty
simple<00:02:04.149> obviously<00:02:05.149> you're<00:02:05.359> doing<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.570> in

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
simple obviously you're doing this in

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.090 
simple obviously you're doing this in
survival<00:02:06.200> mode<00:02:06.229> you'd<00:02:06.530> probably<00:02:06.710> die<00:02:07.070> a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
survival mode you'd probably die a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.499 
survival mode you'd probably die a
hundred<00:02:07.369> times<00:02:07.759> before<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.149> finish<00:02:08.390> the

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
hundred times before you finish the

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.580 
hundred times before you finish the
house<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:08.990> it

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590

conditioner if you can because I'm
pretty<00:02:47.360> sure<00:02:47.480> could<00:02:47.750> be<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.110> million<00:02:48.440> four

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
pretty sure could be like a million four

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.039 
pretty sure could be like a million four
degrees<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.090> might<00:02:50.420> invested<00:02:50.959> in

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
degrees in here so you might invested in

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.080 
degrees in here so you might invested in
an<00:02:51.530> air<00:02:51.620> conditioner<00:02:52.040> or<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.280> fan<00:02:52.489> or<00:02:52.730> something

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
an air conditioner or a fan or something

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.509 
an air conditioner or a fan or something
and<00:02:53.989> then<00:02:54.140> down<00:02:54.379> here<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:54.769> more<00:02:55.010> lava<00:02:55.220> too

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
and then down here we have more lava too

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.220 
and then down here we have more lava too
I<00:02:55.549> think<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.819> was<00:02:55.910> pretty<00:02:56.030> cool<00:02:56.209> we'll<00:02:56.930> come<00:02:57.079> in

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
I think it was pretty cool we'll come in

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.650 
I think it was pretty cool we'll come in
here<00:02:57.500> come<00:02:57.769> back<00:02:57.920> outside<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.599> said

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
here come back outside and like I said

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.509 
here come back outside and like I said

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
in the last two days use case to easily

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.220 
in the last two days use case to easily
make<00:03:01.819> like<00:03:02.030> more<00:03:02.239> routes<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.840> different

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230
