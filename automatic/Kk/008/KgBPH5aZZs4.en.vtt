what the way

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.199 
what the way
what<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.430> getting<00:02:14.640> rid<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.879> so

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.900 
what do we really like getting rid of so
I<00:02:15.450> got<00:02:15.959> rid<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.319> allergy<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> got<00:02:17.879> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I got rid of the allergy and you got to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.449 
I got rid of the allergy and you got to
make<00:02:18.120> sure<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.620> car<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.190> you're<00:02:20.310> going

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
make sure that the car that you're going

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.729 
make sure that the car that you're going
to<00:02:20.550> sell<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.450> original<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
to sell is the original one so as you

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.160 
to sell is the original one so as you
see<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> duplicated<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.209> swapped<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
see the duplicated one I swapped for the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.040 
see the duplicated one I swapped for the
allergy<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.209> into<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> original

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
allergy and then I get into the original

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.589 
allergy and then I get into the original
adder<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.670> then<00:02:29.819> once<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
adder so then once you're in the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.509 
adder so then once you're in the
original<00:02:30.870> vehicle<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.980> want<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.160> take<00:02:32.310> over

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
