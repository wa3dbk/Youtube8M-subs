00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello everyone seduced ampleman and 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome to this new episode 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.390
 meanwhile ol bis the emission that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.710
 analyze and enjoy new info 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.900
 revealed on pokemon remakes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.550
 ruby and sapphire this intro phrase is 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.550
 great but their delirious 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.960
 May 11, 2014 so the first pictures 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.000
 ruby omega and sapphire pokemon 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.920
 alpha were unveiled it's gone on 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 look at it pegi 7 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 I am 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's been three days since you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 we dangle pictures of people and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 we just have a tiny thing like 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 but between it going you'll not begin to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.439
 cough in all not more episodes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.640
 to the east of the wages to yo yo his ways 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.960
 tekki firstly finally but what does 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 you want me to say that there is no 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 have nothing to do with this shit 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.159
 that's all it's a half against then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.159
 see hi to all your next ciao 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 alright I'll see what I can 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.960
 draw 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.299
 good then already we can see that the style 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.580
 pokemon graph is similar to 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.140
 the one of pokémon tig his pokémon is born there 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.670
 knowing that they are both 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.360
 games of the sixth generation we get 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.429
 doubted a little 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
 it's not a mega news of death 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.670
 then kills team grodon that we do not 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.160
 does not look like their effigy on the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 box but doba to hardcore like 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100
 visual wholesale including itunes 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.750
 which proves that what is 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 drawn on the box this is not the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 new and returns opium and the new 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.400
 candy intake but well and good 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 something else like for example 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.610
 a mega evolution but a new 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.440
 external expert form but that's it 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.760
 doubt is also a little because angled 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.500
 who feel a laptop in 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.970
 pokemon x and y so there was 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 great chance for him to reuse the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.610
 model of the game these are both the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.370
 games of the sixth generation 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.200
 so again nothing extraordinary 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.370
 can see king and good have activated 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.830
 their respective talents to know 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.209
 drought and drizzle and as much sputum 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.190
 actually looks like a little 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.570
 as much drought as the drought looks like 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 more to a damn shock supernova is 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.470
 managed on my finger 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.700
 it's still a bit more epic than 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.200
 three drops falling after I live 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.460
 in Rouen so we may not have the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 same notion of drizzle either 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.430
 maybe that for you is a 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.660
 storm grade 12 get them back 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.890
 cows pigs and camels and do not 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.440
 do not go out from home, that's what 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.420
 I see through my window daily 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.810
 by the way talking about fleet groudon 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.890
 come out of the water why can not you 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.140
 put it on the earth cpt is when 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 even its natural element like this 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.390
 earth for example for example after 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.640
 it is true that this idea of groulx which 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.070
 on the earth facing kyogre in the sea 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.410
 it might have been a reminder 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.250
 certain scene of a certain game released in 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.020
 2005 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.220
 the famous game we do not want 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.270
 pronounce the name because he will not have 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.950
 remake but we must not say otherwise 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.510
 we will make the fans cry and so we 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.590
 do not know any more sure and cross is this 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.170
 that he will be in the game is what there is 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.680
 will not be to know I sent husband 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.680
 are looking for him 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.680
 so you have not found it yet but I 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.680
 looking 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 that's what else to say about this thing 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.250
 that already spoken before taste is a 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.870
 little bit of fucking mouth because 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.530
 that we have not tasted anything 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.120
 game has that slab 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.379
 yes because that's a cinematic 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.310
 but even worse than it is 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.079
 maybe a cinematic that does not 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.250
 do not like me in the game because good 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.580
 big so that comes out of the water all this 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.949
 that's what 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.389
 and the others before new images 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.310
 of pokemon al fayed pokemon riga 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.870
 attention attention in this folder and 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.229
 that's what you need before taking your games 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.639
 cats or at least americans one 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.590
 was more sober he was called that a 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.070
 preview what is already closer to the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.270
 reality 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.560
 for once it's not the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.560
 Americans who made people laugh 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.160
 still to be underlined thank you brief 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.450
 racist jokes and to push a little 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.400
 the knife in the wound the blow of the 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.330
 sound effects that are not from the I 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.160
 hopefully 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.289
 there are no sound effects that we have 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.310
 perceived by such a low rumble 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.700
 that the first time I do not even have 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.280
 heard 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.139
 so here I am slightly disappointed but 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.460
 good the next corocoro should not 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.760
 delay so we'll see what he has to 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.320
 say 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.550
 in the meantime I invite you to give 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.870
 your opinion in the comments and I 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.020
 you say hi to all and with my 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.020
 next 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.729
 so I did not find 3 1 but by 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.249
 against says if I can see the neighbor 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.249
 opposite is very interesting
