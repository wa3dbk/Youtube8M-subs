00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello and welcome to this online course 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.309
 Free to learn to knit 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.710
 in this chapter chapter 10 we are going to 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.650
 learn to make the point patent 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.700
 double or 2 by 2 also called point 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.950
 double elastic or 2 x 2 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.800
 this point is the same as the point 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.410
 elastic or channels but doing 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.340
 two points of the right followed by two 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.700
 points upside down and so on consecutively 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.030
 let's alternate points of the right and 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.670
 points upside down so much in the horizontal 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.060
 of the fabric ie on the same spin 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.910
 as in the vertical of the fabric 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.430
 the change from the point of the right to the point 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.920
 the other way round it will be done in the same 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.440
 back is to say that the same spin 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.870
 let's do the right points and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 two points upside down 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.160
 but let's practice once we have 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.299
 assembled the points 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:12.220
 we are going to make the first round 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.530
 starting with two points of the right 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.540
 the points of the right are made 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.360
 introducing the needle of the hand 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.670
 right in the center of the point of the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680
 needle the left hand with the wool that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.490
 clew is passed over the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.130
 of this needle and we get the point to 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.070
 change point we just have to pass 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.280
 the thread in front of the needle as 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.970
 you see in the video or in front of the work and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.970
 make a point inside out 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.220
 Now let's make two points inside out 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 the reverse point is performed 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 introducing the needle in the center of the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.950
 point ahead of the work and going 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.720
 the loop with the thread that comes from 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.760
 ball then we will remove the point 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.550
 getting a new point we change to 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.640
 make two points of the right passing the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.590
 strand back of the work and we do 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.590
 two points of the right 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.550
 and followed we will do two points of the reverse 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.640
 to change we have to pass the thread 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 ahead of the work so let's go 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 realizing two points of the right and two 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.880
 points of the reverse during the whole round 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 if we finished with two points of 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.680
 backwards we will begin the work in the turn 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 next with two points of the right 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 as we are in the video followed by two 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.849
 points upside down and so on in 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.550
 change if we have finished the work with 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.910
 two points of the right we will have with the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.450
 have to start the next round with two 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.020
 points backwards and then two points 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.720
 of the right and so on 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.880
 in the blog I've left you a scheme like 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.450
 this one to make it easier for you and 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.450
 practice 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.739
 the tissue that we are going to obtain is the same 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.340
 both the right and the reverse 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.860
 of labor plus electricity from 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.970
 this point makes it perfect for edges 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.580
 as low neckline strips or cuffs 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 if you like sewing georges the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.230
 make your own clothes of yours 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.380
 own accessories do not miss this one
