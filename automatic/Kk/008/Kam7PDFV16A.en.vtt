00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.269
 chris horner who dont use after this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.769
 long two-day break 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.120
 good there already I do not have the dog of power 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.379
 you do it properly and in addition to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 that I bought myself a little kiss 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.189
 jewelry we will cut a little bit and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 it's very bad do not have me in two 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.380
 killings maybe did they have that in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.369
 actually a man does not even know 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.539
 sponsorship at all 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.890
 I buy saab was actually I 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.150
 did an internship for 1 to 3 weeks and then 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 well we'll after a while you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 cowards if I was forced it's 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 frankly the thing is something of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:48.270
 sick is super brief by two days 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.039
 I had to know how it works and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.000
 nasri inflated income wear myself fucking 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.190
 what do I love that brief 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 today I will talk to you 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 but in fact to call his chains 4 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.239
 as well as the xbox one is a bit of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.519
 stride because frankly it makes the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 well a little bit of rest to take 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.850
 the air all this is something too 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.869
 that I'm doing when I'm doing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 videos but it's true that it would miss 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.780
 a bit of good all that I come back in 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.130
 strength 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.720
 many of these two consoles there at 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 level of wadi at then cerleau 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 angie NGOs 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 governmental and suse and me so in 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 big for peace and organizations have 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 done by the state so organizations 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 outside so who actually studied 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 energy consumption is good 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 these two consoles there ie 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 how much are we going to say expenses at the level 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 electricity all that is consoles 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.790
 there low compared to the xbox 360 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 and at playstation 3 what she 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.439
 consume more certainly there is a new 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 ergonomics a new design and a 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.380
 new power that integrate and we get 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.299
 ask the question is it more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.619
 strong jump logically yes yes yes 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.119
 this is already the case what you need to know 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.409
 is that xbox one is three times 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.189
 more powerful than those of the xbox 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.930
 360 or that of the playstation 3 as well 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.950
 one to his playstation 4 and 3 times 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.229
 more powerful at the level of 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
 energy consumption than that of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.399
 xbox 360 or that of the playstation 3 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 so still people have to be told 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.600
 that we are still in a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.190
 in law 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.810
 good and somewhere it consumes a lot 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.400
 gold is the nrdc so it's a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.410
 non-governmental organization like 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.990
 so I say them natural resources 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.280
 wholesale defense council that shoes 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.020
 of Americans who did a study there 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.090
 on it and who defends a little bit that's who 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.590
 are really trying to limit and we 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.790
 will say the devices products 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.040
 electronic as they have and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.720
 high energy consumption and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.790
 to try both arms 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.830
 dropped or do things what they 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.090
 complain a little bit about that and have 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.830
 said one fine day we will study 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630
 towards this energy consumption on 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.370
 his consoles there they may have believed 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.420
 only to the letter - +1 later logically I 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.530
 think if we do what they 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.209
 knew very well that it would please 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 so much, that's it, it's a lot 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.989
 more consumed down of course this is the case 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 as I tell you so it's here is 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.770
 been tested so by this organization 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.930
 there and so that to test on several 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.560
 various way ie several 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.300
 categories 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.470
 we could say by streaming that's to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.120
 say while watching a video of another 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.520
 nobody in the games is what she 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 consumes more and in by usb not a 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.950
 little moment has fallen at home listening to you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.450
 music via a Dunkirk 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.239
 connectivity a connection anyway 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.670
 with a flow of no information that will 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.900
 and have gone past who will still do that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.950
 will actually increase this consumption 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.450
 the announced how much mass is 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.950
 interesting what you need to know is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.989
 between these two consoles the xbox and the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.390
 playstation 4 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 which console consumes the most then 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.970
 already at the xbox one consumes 40% 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.010
 of energy more energy than the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.900
 xbox 360 and the playstation 3 actually 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.340
 that is, it has a way of being 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.570
 as I wanted to said in a session of 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 game so that's really in this 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.440
 category the hall consume up to 40 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.760
 % more it's just huge for a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.970
 countdown in this just a session of 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.519
 Thu 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.660
 they already consume 40% of boussens I 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.640
 have you said just above three times 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.959
 more generally enough we take 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.549
 overall for what you need to know 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.940
 is that playstation 4 actually 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.220
 consume much more than the xbox one 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 so I'll give you after just a little 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.310
 close to the power level how much 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.410
 consumes annually consumes 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.660
 much more than xbox one and except 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.170
 in two categories in standby 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.450
 and stops actually for 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.800
 here for the console wholesale xbox 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.450
 men consume much more at the 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.360
 xbox either she consumes a lot 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.770
 a lot of energy end of electricity 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.920
 when had standby time it's a 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.570
 sick thing she consumes 50% of the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.260
 consumption of the xbox one is due to 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.239
 standby 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.680
 will you join against 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.970
 the agent is what driving accounts 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.410
 because there the playstation 4 has done 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.669
 not that but that's the quail 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.940
 really a big consumption mode 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.070
 Eve 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.230
 I'm not your console she consumes 50 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.639
 % limit beyond what she can 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.180
 consume so ceased anyway 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.530
 huge thing 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.740
 is what you need to know is 100 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.940
 kilowatts actually it's not in 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.340
 finally that is used for nothing 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.410
 for the xbox one and that this ngo the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.780
 low is that this non 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.130
 government will be found ben here 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.330
 find their discontent what is 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.590
 quite normal anyway huh you 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.810
 say that there is all this as electricity 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.690
 who's going on I do not know where a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.860
 acquired which is limit 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.680
 waste is really excited 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.389
 really used for nothing in fashion 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.669
 watch out for pcc 1 4 attention because she 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.290
 is also a she consumes a lot 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.850
 a lot and a lot more in games 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.930
 So it's true that it is very good here 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.270
 it's still something that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.740
 found there are audi big 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.780
 differences between these two consoles the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.039
 first principal does the men livebox 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.220
 consume a lot more in sleep mode 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.020
 particularly and baselian has made 4 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.240
 conceding a game in the menu where you 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.190
 want balcony are actually more than the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.990
 xbox once when a running condition and 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.640
 her chains 4l ben she consumes 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.900
 much more is on the other hand in a state of 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.310
 watch what is rather shocking we dare 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.050
 there has typed whore the saw console 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.120
 not off globally she just 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.140
 big in pause mode but that's it 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.720
 consumes enormously enormously 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.830
 of electricity all of this finally for 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.200
 not much so it's also a blow 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.960
 all this every year without who are 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.460
 the wedge spend his years share and it's not 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.570
 to know a little bit anyway and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.729
 which adds to you that it limits to a 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.500
 xbox live gold nmg beautiful subscription 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.390
 time but they are 15 euros I think 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.930
 an aravane leading the year no it's 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.270
 not 15 euros 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.470
 but maybe several months bump I 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.570
 can still help you finally 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.669
 have a month or two months of the end 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.270
 a few years late electricity bat 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.610
 of 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.350
 subscription actually makes xbox theft 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.360
 so it can really serve some 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.890
 part of it here it's pretty much 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.600
 all I hope my return is 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.460
 weird or maybe not not you 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.570
 bah pleased too bad for you but 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.440
 will always receive inert mass a small 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.240
 game merit of you do like you 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.440
 want except given mission to that of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.520
 personal thank you all and I say 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.520
 at the next stop his way
