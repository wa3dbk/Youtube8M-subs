concept<00:00:06.540> number<00:00:06.660> 10<00:00:07.110> melodic<00:00:07.680> doodads<00:00:08.570> this

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
concept number 10 melodic doodads this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.920 
concept number 10 melodic doodads this
is<00:00:09.750> an<00:00:09.870> idea<00:00:10.170> where<00:00:10.549> you<00:00:11.549> keep<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.120> common

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
is an idea where you keep a common

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.140 
is an idea where you keep a common
melodic<00:00:13.410> theme<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:14.160> across<00:00:14.760> a<00:00:14.789> few

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
melodic theme going across a few

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.290 
melodic theme going across a few
different<00:00:15.209> chords<00:00:15.959> so<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:17.010> works<00:00:17.430> really

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
different chords so this works really

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.339 
different chords so this works really
well<00:00:18.949> over<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.280> one<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> six<00:00:21.300> minor<00:00:21.630> because

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
well over a one to a six minor because

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.339 
well over a one to a six minor because
you<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> relative<00:00:23.070> minor<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:24.210> C<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
you have a relative minor like C to a

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.009 
you have a relative minor like C to a
minor<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.070> there's<00:00:26.970> certain<00:00:27.330> licks<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
minor and there's certain licks that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.409 
minor and there's certain licks that
work<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.339> sound<00:00:29.669> beautiful

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
work and see that also sound beautiful

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.220 
work and see that also sound beautiful
over<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.250> relative<00:00:32.250> minor<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.150> for<00:00:34.140> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
over the relative minor so this for this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.760 
over the relative minor so this for this
example<00:00:34.680> I'll<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:36.690> C<00:00:37.020> major<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
example I'll show you in C major and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.160 
example I'll show you in C major and
we're<00:00:38.400> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.580> use<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.630> C<00:00:39.900> major

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
we're going to use the C major

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.280 
we're going to use the C major
pentatonic<00:00:40.710> scale<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:44.720> that's<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.930> C<00:00:46.110> major

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
pentatonic scale so that's the C major

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.890 
pentatonic scale so that's the C major
pentatonic<00:00:46.710> scale<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.880> is<00:00:47.910> also<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> minor

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
pentatonic scale which is also a minor

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.950 
pentatonic scale which is also a minor
pentatonic<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.400> we're<00:00:56.490> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> use

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
pentatonic I and then we're going to use

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.920 
pentatonic I and then we're going to use
these<00:00:57.960> our<00:00:58.170> fourths<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:59.480> third

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.539 

little<00:01:03.930> melodic<00:01:04.379> idea

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.890 

nothing<00:01:08.549> really<00:01:08.700> hard<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.150> all

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.030 

so<00:01:13.900> once<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.170> get<00:01:14.290> comfortable<00:01:14.470> with<00:01:14.920> that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.650 

then<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.370> use<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.730> muted<00:01:22.060> technique<00:01:22.480> and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
then you can use the muted technique and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:36.450 
then you can use the muted technique and
come<00:01:22.780> up<00:01:22.930> with<00:01:23.050> little<00:01:23.200> rhythms<00:01:23.620> like<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
come up with little rhythms like so I'm

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.860 
come up with little rhythms like so I'm
in<00:01:36.610> I'm<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:38.170> pentatonic<00:01:38.890> position<00:01:39.370> and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
in I'm in that pentatonic position and

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.960 
in I'm in that pentatonic position and
the<00:01:40.870> harmony<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:41.890> going<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.130> be<00:01:42.190> suggested<00:01:42.940> by

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
the harmony is going to be suggested by

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.030 
the harmony is going to be suggested by
what<00:01:43.600> chord<00:01:43.900> we're<00:01:44.080> on<00:01:44.230> at<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> time<00:01:44.710> which

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
what chord we're on at the time which

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.770 
what chord we're on at the time which
I'll<00:01:45.220> show<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.760> in<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.060> second<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:46.480> we<00:01:46.510> play

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
I'll show you in a second when we play

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.680 
I'll show you in a second when we play
over<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.340> can<00:01:48.610> move<00:01:49.000> up<00:01:49.030> one<00:01:49.480> more

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
over also you can move up one more

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.840 
over also you can move up one more
position<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:50.830> would<00:01:50.980> be<00:01:51.160> another

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
position so this would be another

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.680 
position so this would be another
position<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.710> minor<00:01:54.070> pentatonic<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:55.240> major

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
position of minor pentatonic or major

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.770 
position of minor pentatonic or major
minute<00:01:56.080> otic<00:01:56.380> depending<00:01:56.910> move<00:01:57.910> C<00:01:58.570> major

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
minute otic depending move C major

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.280 
minute otic depending move C major
pentatonic<00:02:01.020> basic<00:02:02.020> box<00:02:02.380> blues<00:02:03.070> position<00:02:03.760> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
pentatonic basic box blues position and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.350 
pentatonic basic box blues position and
you<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.470> combine<00:02:05.650> combine<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:06.940> come<00:02:07.240> up

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
you can combine combine that so come up

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:19.550 
you can combine combine that so come up
with<00:02:07.510> some<00:02:07.660> little<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.270> I'm<00:02:13.360> doing

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:34.590 

so<00:02:20.560> we'll<00:02:20.800> apply<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.150> what<00:02:34.300> I'll<00:02:34.420> do<00:02:34.570> now

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
so we'll apply that so what I'll do now

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.320 
so we'll apply that so what I'll do now
is<00:02:34.780> I'll<00:02:35.080> play<00:02:35.380> over<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.770> progression<00:02:36.400> really

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
is I'll play over a progression really

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.600 
is I'll play over a progression really
simple<00:02:37.920> C<00:02:38.920> major<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.550> minor<00:02:40.540> seven<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.260> I'll<00:02:41.830> I

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
simple C major a minor seven and I'll I

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.400 
simple C major a minor seven and I'll I
don't<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.660> what<00:02:43.780> I'll<00:02:43.870> play<00:02:44.080> yet<00:02:44.260> but

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
don't really know what I'll play yet but

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.360 
don't really know what I'll play yet but
I'll<00:02:44.500> go<00:02:44.680> into<00:02:45.630> some<00:02:46.630> melodic<00:02:47.560> figure<00:02:48.190> that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I'll go into some melodic figure that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:42.320 
I'll go into some melodic figure that
will<00:02:48.490> repeat<00:02:48.850> over<00:02:49.060> both<00:02:49.390> chords

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.420 

okay<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:43.390> those<00:03:43.690> are<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> few<00:03:43.960> ideas<00:03:44.200> using<00:03:44.740> two

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
okay so those are a few ideas using two

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.720 
okay so those are a few ideas using two
notes<00:03:45.960> mainly<00:03:46.960> based<00:03:47.140> out<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.730> pentatonic

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
notes mainly based out of pentatonic

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.960 
notes mainly based out of pentatonic
Paul<00:03:49.660> bass<00:03:49.900> had<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.170> pintuck<00:03:50.590> actually<00:03:51.040> just

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
Paul bass had a pintuck actually just

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.740 
Paul bass had a pintuck actually just
using<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:53.230> idea<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:54.250> they<00:03:54.910> work<00:03:55.150> over<00:03:55.540> both

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
using that idea and they work over both

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.920 
using that idea and they work over both
chords<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:57.030> couple<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.150> ideas<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.780> was

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
chords so a couple of ideas that I was

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.000 
chords so a couple of ideas that I was
doing<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.440> was<00:03:59.470> using

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.470 

just<00:04:07.010> making<00:04:07.370> little<00:04:07.520> melodies<00:04:08.030> out<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.330> those

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
just making little melodies out of those

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.180 
just making little melodies out of those
simple<00:04:10.150> fourths<00:04:11.150> thirds<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.680> then<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.980> would

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
simple fourths thirds and then I would

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.520 
simple fourths thirds and then I would
go<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.730> get<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.480> little<00:04:14.690> hammer<00:04:14.900> on<00:04:15.020> that's

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
go up and get a little hammer on that's

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:24.480 
go up and get a little hammer on that's
