well<00:01:06.990> digital<00:01:07.500> broadcasts<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> list<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
well digital broadcasts have a list of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.690 
well digital broadcasts have a list of
advantages<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:09.990> analog<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> most

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
advantages over analog one of the most

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.840 
advantages over analog one of the most
important<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.869> quality<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.220> value<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
important is the quality the value of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
important is the quality the value of
digital<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.259> efficient<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
digital is that it's more efficient you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.890 
digital is that it's more efficient you
get<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> much<00:01:18.060> better<00:01:18.240> picture<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.810> much

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
get a much better picture and much

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
get a much better picture and much
better<00:01:19.080> sound<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:20.009> sort<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.340> going

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
better sound it's sort of like going

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
better sound it's sort of like going
