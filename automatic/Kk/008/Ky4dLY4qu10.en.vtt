 welcome to a test on the channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 a lot of time that I did not do one of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.069
 these the truth is that it appeals 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 but the last three you're seeing 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.950
 out there I do not like those who 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.200
 me ye then was a bit like that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.219
 They have something i do not stop me estem 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.570
 the hungry subscriber that has made me 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.250
 see if it is just recently finished the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 UNHCR headquarters and I think it would be perfect 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 discover what character you are from this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 magnificent headquarters you do not have the link to the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.630
 extinction if you want to do this test 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.920
 and see what characters to you and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.689
 truth is that personally I 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.760
 they like quite a lot of 'not us' characters 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 I like it a lot I like it like I like it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.940
 like to see I like a lot but 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.559
 there are also some that I dislike 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 quite how can be my to mass or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.270
 how could melon sonar be that of 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.649
 my favorites and please I hope not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 I touch none of these touches me 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
 like I would be very happy with him is that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.510
 the charisma that character has and if 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 more let's start with this penalty of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 test if a friend of yours is in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 danger by sales in trouble what is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.840
 your reaction I the truth is that I am from 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.430
 help both my family and my 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.199
 friends because I feel my friends with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 my family and I will read what are the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.820
 answers he gives me I think about what was 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 the cause of the problem and tried to pose 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 questions that give me solutions is a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 complicated control I heard him give him a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.710
 advice but I stand by is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 It is also quite 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.390
 when a person has a problem 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.720
 I think she should solve it alone with 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.860
 someone nothing a third person 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.659
 goal in the middle of the problem that does not 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.130
 they concern after that in a great 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.600
 scenario where you find detail the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.310
 situation explained several solutions and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.050
 see which one is better is pretty good 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.940
 pose enough solutions to see 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.920
 which is the one that also pointed me to the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.790
 blows are going to defend it is a little is 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.170
 without thinking 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.490
 I hear it I try to think for later 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.409
 talk to the guys and grau all the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.270
 misunderstanding I hear it so is the ya 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.619
 the fight is going to be fun I'll 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.780
 truth is that what I would do would be 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.850
 listen to it and stay out of it I think 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.450
 that is the most logical thing that exists in 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.320
 this world that helps reach the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.789
 hands of people for that are 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 different advice what is your vice 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.410
 hobby which video game no then 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.509
 more for the chocolate con play with 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.490
 with puzzles or intelligence games to 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.890
 eat any candy the truth is that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.380
 I wanted to buy video games I know that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.019
 if it is and it will choose apples, it would come out 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.369
 chocolate is very clear and also the 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.620
 theme of the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.390
 we have intelligence candy but I 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.340
 I had to choose what I really 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.159
 I would take it to be playing video games 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.489
 I love I like the unknown mother 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.000
 mine 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.349
 the truth is that it has been a series 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.239
 awesome for me I had not seen it 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.250
 I had never been stung by curiosity 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.650
 I had eaten any spoiler of this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.480
 series and after many years I have seen 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.560
 this year I have recently seen less 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.849
 of a month and the truth is that I was 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.860
 tears fell and everything went 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.140
 amazing I recommend I recommend 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.879
 from the heart that you see it, I do not see things from 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140
 girl is mentioned your character pleases me 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.599
 I've seen it, I think it's unanimous 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.489
 but I prefer something more detective this 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.500
 If you want, it's a good mood. 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.650
 I like talking to is my passion 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.870
 truth is that giving I'm not obsessed 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.629
 already step is like that inside during a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.819
 couple of days approaching a plush 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.230
 something rich and I think it's a good anime 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.390
 and so it is unanimous in what kind of 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.829
 scenario you can work on the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.420
 questions in my mind thinking the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.640
 blind every possibility chocolate 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.019
 sitting playing video games almost not 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.240
 I think the solution arrives alone 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.920
 eating sweets while I plan 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.180
 it's fun there are still many people to 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.010
 which observe and give me ideas 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 when dexterity games recording in 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.770
 this area to think better the truth is 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.770
 what 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.480
 I believe 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.510
 what do you need 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.630
 I would think in my mind is not it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.300
 what 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.740
 emiliana creates a stage playing something 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.440
 I think I would think coldly about 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.950
 plan let's see I think my mind 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.330
 would solve the questions is very 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.070
 strange because the chocolate sitting the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.870
 work written in the way he works 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.960
 It's very strange and I do not think it's the most 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.090
 logic in my case as I am I am not 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.800
 looking for character since my mind or 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.830
 juana videogames I almost do not think 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.140
 solution but if you have a problem then 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.500
 I think in my mind which character does not 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.500
 like more 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.140
 here I have three favorites I have three 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.730
 favorites the light and riu those three are 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.070
 my favourites 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.440
 is more is more here may be that some 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.410
 kill me but I think I get to like 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.420
 more light than any light happened to me 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.550
 It seems an incredible character I think 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.140
 one that has an epic charisma that 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.720
 try to make very movements 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.190
 smart even to the end is 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.630
 very marked this character is very 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.830
 marked so I would say that I stay 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.980
 with light although the reboot is also 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.290
 incredible by god is that in the seat 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.700
 they are three it costs me I count 10 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.110
 light and the fact that I'm left with the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.689
 hyper lighting like it 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.729
 light and river 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.389
 this complicated is complicated entity 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.679
 lady or cheating since I stay with light 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.749
 I stay with the law let's say to the last 

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.849
 question do you get a person only 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.709
 truly exclusive and aggressive not only 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.329
 You are yourself cold and cautious I like it 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.159
 enjoy pain happiness or 

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.269
 worry other calculator 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.610
 smart 

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:05.019
 it does not need to be accepted of which 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.999
 writer you showed yourself how are you 

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:08.739
 really the truth is that is that I 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.239
 I show as if I really actually do 

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:12.639
 I have a lot on YouTube, I always say 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:14.169
 that I am like that if likewise here in the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.759
 I do have to say something always 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.529
 I say it many times many people 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.839
 comes there you see how you answer this for 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.459
 what do you answer in this way because that 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.259
 I do not try to keep any kind of 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.819
 picture or anything when I got into 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.499
 youtube was to share my 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.139
 experiences my things my games my 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.179
 life and it's real I do not just have a life 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.129
 Unamuno I do not have a life of lies or 

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:35.050
 I have a fictional life or anything like this 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.959
 so well I would say that I am a 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.309
 neutral person and only myself is like 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.110
 I'm not is that I enjoy 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.029
 pain yes I like to enjoy the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.619
 many others happiness I am much more 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.110
 happy giving something to someone I want and 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:49.420
 I see that he enjoys getting the same 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.200
 it seems to me that seeing the happiness of another 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.850
 person is me busier then has not been 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.530
 accepted the truth is that if we want 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.660
 totally as I am but I do not care 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.670
 has accepted that I do not have consumerism 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.290
 tattoos that I have that is to say I am very at my 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.000
 march but I would not say that between all 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.100
 these options I will choose neutral only 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.450
 I am myself so let's give it now 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.800
 see what old character I do not use and why 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.710
 please do not leave any character 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.980
 we see that to mention my friends my 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.980
 friends 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.780
 and a little more curious simple age 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.979
 smart social is also 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.000
 related and do not fall behind in the 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.970
 the subject of thinking 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.199
 you are a very sentimental middle point and the 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.970
 very neutral the dya is what it was 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.290
 because they do not harm yours, you like the 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.699
 technology and parties released 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.440
 to the whole world how emotional you are 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.690
 because you wear that day must be you 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.850
 It is not very common for you to be angry , 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.530
 if you do it you have to be careful nothing 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.990
 well, that's true, that's true, 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.240
 It costs a lot to get angry but a lot 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.039
 much much I have a level a level of 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.690
 angry that many times commented he answered 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.190
 to me because I'm not mad at guys 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.840
 I'm angry when I get angry 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.070
 truth is that we never get angry for
