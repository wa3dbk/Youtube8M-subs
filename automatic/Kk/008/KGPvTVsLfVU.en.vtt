 the battery due to excessive heat

 Charging cable with your mobile phone also in the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 You should use an almost empty cell phone like that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 want to charge quickly as possible 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.439
