00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 so we appeared so bratello 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 you are not in this topic 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.670
 a small teleport can 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.980
 teleport your big ass good 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 to the channel i recall about and i 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 rigpa in games hello my dears 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 viewers myself i'm pawing 1 mods review 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 Mainkvrat today we will consider 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.010
 the simplest teleport 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.779
 little mott gives this little thing 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 through which we can teleport to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.300
 any place of our world first 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 look at the craft means ok glass here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
 such a position red dust pearl 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 ender 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.539
 and of course the iron block we get 2 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 tele under further after we 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.250
 put our teleport to the right place 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.469
 we immediately get this kind of thing 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.230
 register locations 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 this indicates our coordinates 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.449
 I have teleports at the moment 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.539
 installed two ports pav 1 and pov 2 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.790
 Now we will try 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.960
 go teleport 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.090
 step we place as we need 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 immediately shows here such a menu as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.030
 if we fly in space we click on pov 2 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 and we appeared on the second teleport 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.820
 it is really very convenient and simple 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 let's put and account somewhere one 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 somewhere in the cave somewhere here here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.420
 here and after we set us 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.390
 given the opportunity to call 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.520
 call our teleport called pav 3 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.579
 enter here all telepath installed go 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 on it we enter so are placed on 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.369
 center 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.299
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.270
 ta ta ta ta and perfectly select Pav 10 a 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.399
 we appeared on a tree other than that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 telepath works in the lower world 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.719
 yes guys this is also very convenient if you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.020
 example wanted to appear somewhere 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.450
 specific place is also a fortress in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.429
 a particular room is no problem 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.599
 let's test 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.409
 go lower world we put our telepath where 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.760
 here even let it be so 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.620
 called hal enter and let us tread 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.189
 so so so so so so so so so 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.189
 so and 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:34.489
 take an example pov 2 we host 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.930
 loading the world so we appeared so 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.359
 bratello 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.919
 you are not in this topic 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:45.590
 a small teleport can 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:47.819
 teleport your big apple 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.790
 now let's see how you can 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:56.790
 teleport to the lower world 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:00.209
 We are stepping forward forward as hell will 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.000
 here we are here here we are here 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.169
 quite simple and easy and we do not need 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.639
 no here obsidian and stir up such 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.060
 here is a heavy portal 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:14.819
 it's all much much easier especially 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.180
 craft here is a fairly accessible example 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.659
 if you began to teleport loaded 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.840
 Now we will at least not 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.849
 wanted and wanted to go anywhere 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.810
 We take a push and we of course 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.819
 our teleport was also canceled by guys 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.870
 I advise you not to lose the register in their body 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.359
 under the location 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.400
 because this little thing except she 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.500
 binds all the teleport location and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.989
 indicates the coordinates so she can without 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.329
 problems beat your teleport and give you 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.669
 opportunity to put you suddenly mind you need 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.859
 for you place an example here click 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.720
 enter thats all i hope you have been 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.949
 useful is this small mod which gives 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.909
 opportunity to teleport to any 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.489
 a place 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.479
 much easier thanks everyone for watching 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.479
 to new meetings
