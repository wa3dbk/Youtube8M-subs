00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.369 
I don't mind doing that for you if you
don't<00:02:13.300> have<00:02:13.450> any<00:02:13.599> equipment<00:02:13.840> or<00:02:14.140> something

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
don't have any equipment or something

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.089 
don't have any equipment or something
like<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:16.209> as<00:02:16.930> far<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:17.260> these<00:02:17.500> two<00:02:17.560> I'm

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
like that but as far as these two I'm

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.720 
like that but as far as these two I'm
definitely<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.760> from<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> ABCs<00:02:19.780> back<00:02:20.080> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
definitely going from the ABCs back to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.800 
definitely going from the ABCs back to
back<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.000> carbons<00:02:22.360> 11<00:02:23.319> by<00:02:23.440> 5<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.810> alright

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
back to the carbons 11 by 5 so alright

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
back to the carbons 11 by 5 so alright
guys<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.260> wanted<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.830> put<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.519> there

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
guys just wanted to put this out there

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.940 
guys just wanted to put this out there
and<00:02:27.849> let<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.290> tell<00:02:29.290> me<00:02:29.349> what<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.739> about

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and let you tell me what you think about

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.009 
and let you tell me what you think about
the<00:02:30.099> difference<00:02:30.400> between<00:02:30.640> them<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.900> all

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
the difference between them that's all

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.390 
the difference between them that's all
the<00:02:32.170> hard<00:02:32.349> information<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.890> have<00:02:33.099> was<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the hard information I have was the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.170 
the hard information I have was the
amperage<00:02:33.849> draw<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.420> flight<00:02:34.629> times<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
amperage draw and the flight times and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.069 
amperage draw and the flight times and
definitely<00:02:37.180> they<00:02:37.269> pcs<00:02:37.569> are<00:02:37.690> just<00:02:37.870> very

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
definitely they pcs are just very

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.710 
definitely they pcs are just very
slightly<00:02:38.379> smoother<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.269> wind<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.480> stuff

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
slightly smoother and wind and stuff

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600 
slightly smoother and wind and stuff
like<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.049> but<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.590> 11<00:02:41.799> by<00:02:41.890> fives<00:02:42.099> perform

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
like that but the 11 by fives perform

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.129 
like that but the 11 by fives perform
extremely<00:02:43.299> well<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:45.099> care
