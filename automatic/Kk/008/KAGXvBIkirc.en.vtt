00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone i'm crazy black critic 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.450
 and I come to bring you a criticism of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.370
 fuck fight channel disney chanel 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 and if you think you 're going to be offended and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 Tell them put and death is how you are 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 well pendejo disney is the best channel of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 the story almost as cool as the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 pokemon of the fifth region ha ha ha ha 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 ha ha ha I have no friends then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.150
 go to a TV whore and act like an idiot 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.789
 to see your channel but while I 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.800
 I say what I think of your god for that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.269
 I have prepared five points of things 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 more than they do test that there may be in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.710
 this channel provision in fact that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.800
 it can be the number 0 reason so 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.379
 say it let's analyze the name disney 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 channel disney is shit and chanel is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.539
 channel if we remove the letter faith to channel 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 we would have this this anal guy and the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.680
 shit comes out of the anus so the channels 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.350
 of disney are shit and the channel would be the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.620
 straight good now yes no more to say 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 let's go with the network are number one 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 disguise why I say it has 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.910
 trash programs because very simple do not give 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 laugh yeah that's right they do not give anything to laugh and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.780
 they want to rescue their jokes by putting 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 laughs recorded every 3 seconds 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500
 and because the truth seriously they want 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 believe that after that joke so 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.090
 anodyne too many people shit on the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.190
 laughter pants go fuck yourself 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 hire better writers if in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 they really want to make me laugh 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 by the way I've noticed and they always have 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.259
 the same writers company for 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.040
 all his series that's the reason for 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 what his jokes look so much fucking 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.110
 reason number god I say two all their 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.259
 series nowadays are simple excuses 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.910
 to attract new singers to the public 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.830
 they take advantage of that children to that 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.750
 old are assholes and are thrilled to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.360
 see that the ccoo penis of that series ends 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 to take out a record and they want to buy it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.590
 that way this guy takes money from 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.450
 both business television and music the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.550
 which makes me a great shit because 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 they sing about pure bullshit and only 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.750
 some that another singer arrives at 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 succeed as they should and if they have many 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.420
 followers but to be honest to me I 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.570
 shit all your songs reason number 3 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.910
 he gets too excited with his 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.800
 products as soon as they see that something is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.410
 hitting too much in front of the audience now 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.920
 they want to use it for anything a 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 example phineas and ferb I will be sincere to me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.610
 I like this series but the fact that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.220
 they want to squeeze the pathetic 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.590
 I do not like an example of this penis 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.780
 example would be disney like any of 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 you will know I had taken a game to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.430
 iphone called where is my fucking 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 water and after a while guess that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.840
 if that's how they changed the game so that 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.330
 be the same but now with our 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.190
 favorite character but now we can 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.080
 go back to buy the game but with 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.569
 different pet and which is more 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.519
 striking but do not worry yet 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.400
 continues in the market for the same price 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.410
 the original game would not surprise me that 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 in a few years the mickey mouse logo 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 disney chanel now was the head of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.690
 phineas or the form of perry reason number 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.370
 4 Then again there Phineas and Ferb 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.730
 something that I thought was true 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.290
 fuckin ' marvel the avengers 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.269
 superheroes very chingones and strong that 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.200
 for a long time each one was 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.690
 growing grace 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.970
 to the fans with comic movies 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.860
 even videogames now happened to have 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.170
 the greatest adventure of their lives 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.540
 now finally what we have expected 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.330
 from the beginning they will finally come out 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.040
 in phineas and ferb wow I can not believe it 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.110
 finally they have what it takes to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.060
 to be able to leave the program without a doubt 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.800
 some all their dignity and image will be 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.260

 that in an interview in this chapter 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.500
 they said hahahaha with this work I think 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.569
 that both companies will benefit x from 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.640

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.500

 plans to continue and keep buying 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.099
 many companies in order to 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.930
 monopolize everything until finally 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.730
 govern the world 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.190
 to tell the truth disney is scary for everything 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.230
