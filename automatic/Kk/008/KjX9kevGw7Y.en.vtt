00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
the pause obviously have a lot of

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.510 
the pause obviously have a lot of
chemicals<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.440> they<00:01:53.650> stripped<00:01:54.130> my<00:01:54.280> hair

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
chemicals in and they stripped my hair

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.100 
chemicals in and they stripped my hair
or<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.909> red<00:01:55.090> because<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.510> had<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.780> special

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
or the red because I had the special

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.830 
or the red because I had the special
effects<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.460> stretched<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.600> a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
effects in and it stretched it to like a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680 
effects in and it stretched it to like a
blonde<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:00.580> think<00:02:00.970> that's<00:02:01.210> what's<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.659> to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
blonde so I think that's what's going to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.480 
blonde so I think that's what's going to
happen<00:02:02.020> because<00:02:02.409> that's<00:02:02.710> what<00:02:02.920> happened

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
happen because that's what happened

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.950 
happen because that's what happened
chemicals<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.390> pool<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:07.299> yeah<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.750> says

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
chemicals in the pool but yeah it says

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.229 
chemicals in the pool but yeah it says
that<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.200> doesn't<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.550> contains<00:02:12.970> no

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
that it doesn't have it contains no

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.350 
that it doesn't have it contains no
bleach<00:02:13.390> or<00:02:13.780> ammonia<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.209> don't

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
bleach or ammonia and so you don't

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
you've got a lot of cold build-up or

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.400 
you've got a lot of cold build-up or
your<00:02:38.470> hair's<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.769> dark<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.459> mines<00:02:39.850> both

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
and this is 12 pounds or 10 pounds I

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.199 
and this is 12 pounds or 10 pounds I
think<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.190> normal<00:02:48.190> one<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.880> social

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
think for the normal one it was social

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.460 
think for the normal one it was social
quite<00:02:49.360> expensive<00:02:49.569> but<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> lot

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
quite expensive but was it's a lot

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.280 
quite expensive but was it's a lot
cheaper<00:02:50.680> than<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:51.450> stylist<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.660> I'm<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.110> gonna

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
cheaper than a stylist so I'm just gonna

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.699 
cheaper than a stylist so I'm just gonna
zoom<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.680> tiny<00:02:53.920> bit<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> color

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
zoom in a tiny bit so this is the color

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.449 
zoom in a tiny bit so this is the color
of<00:02:56.860> my<00:02:56.980> hair<00:02:59.069> okay

of my hair okay
it's<00:03:00.819> kind<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:01.239> an<00:03:01.390> off<00:03:05.459> blood<00:03:06.459> color<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019

it's kind of like an off blood color and
the<00:03:08.620> roots<00:03:08.829> obviously<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> little<00:03:09.519> bit<00:03:09.609> darker

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the roots obviously a little bit darker

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.060

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
and there's a lot of mixture side to

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.759 
and there's a lot of mixture side to
really<00:04:03.790> two<00:04:04.090> packets<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.750> only<00:04:05.560> brought<00:04:05.709> one

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
that's to be expected because you know

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.150 
that's to be expected because you know
it's<00:05:34.130> sort<00:05:34.220> of<00:05:34.310> like<00:05:34.370> years<00:05:34.790> of<00:05:35.030> die<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.660> said

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
burning up so I'm really happy with the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.180 
burning up so I'm really happy with the
result<00:05:38.570> it's<00:05:39.260> turned<00:05:39.470> out<00:05:39.590> really<00:05:39.860> well

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
result it's turned out really well

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.600 
result it's turned out really well
it's<00:05:40.580> fairly<00:05:41.120> even<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.750> mean<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.320> only<00:05:42.590> used<00:05:43.460> it

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
I've never used it before so it was hard

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.930 
I've never used it before so it was hard
to<00:05:46.700> know<00:05:46.820> how<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.120> kind<00:05:47.360> of<00:05:47.419> apply<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:48.940> I'm

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
to know how to kind of apply it I'm

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.580 
to know how to kind of apply it I'm
really<00:05:50.150> happy<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.540> result<00:05:50.840> one<00:05:51.440> thing

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
really happy with the result one thing

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.320 
really happy with the result one thing
that<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.770> would<00:05:51.830> say<00:05:52.100> is<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.280> when<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.150> have

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
that I would say is that when you have

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.420 
that I would say is that when you have
the<00:05:53.510> cap<00:05:53.780> on<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.680> go<00:05:54.890> into<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.220> shower

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
the cap on and you go into the shower

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.159 
the cap on and you go into the shower
when<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.550> wore<00:05:58.940> not<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.180> cap<00:05:59.419> I<00:05:59.570> just<00:05:59.750> put<00:05:59.930> cling

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
when I wore not the cap I just put cling

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.230 
when I wore not the cap I just put cling
firmer<00:06:00.380> on<00:06:00.470> my<00:06:00.590> head<00:06:00.770> I<00:06:00.979> went<00:06:01.220> in<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.490> shower<00:06:01.850> I

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
thought oh and I hasn't worked because

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.070 
thought oh and I hasn't worked because
my<00:06:04.910> hair<00:06:05.060> just<00:06:05.240> look<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:05.510> exact<00:06:05.750> same

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
my hair just look the exact same

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.040 
my hair just look the exact same
but<00:06:06.710> then<00:06:06.830> they<00:06:06.919> give<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.510> buffer<00:06:08.510> which<00:06:09.020> is

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
but then they give you a buffer which is

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.650 
but then they give you a buffer which is
kind<00:06:09.350> of<00:06:09.380> like<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.770> shampoo<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.760> gets<00:06:11.390> rid<00:06:11.630> of

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
kind of like a shampoo that gets rid of

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.950 
kind of like a shampoo that gets rid of
and<00:06:12.520> gets<00:06:13.520> rid<00:06:13.729> of<00:06:13.790> it<00:06:13.940> from<00:06:14.180> your<00:06:14.330> hair<00:06:14.600> so<00:06:14.900> it

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
and gets rid of it from your hair so it

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.540 
and gets rid of it from your hair so it

and you have to first reach your hat for
ten<00:06:19.190> minutes<00:06:19.490> or<00:06:19.729> five<00:06:20.330> if<00:06:20.510> you've<00:06:20.630> got<00:06:20.780> short
