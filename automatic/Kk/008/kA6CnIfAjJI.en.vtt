00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
right here we have some mud moss on it

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
right here we have some mud moss on it
kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> looks<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.610> grass<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> first

bit now lichen is organisms consisting

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.610 
bit now lichen is organisms consisting
of<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.890> fungus<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:22.269> photosynthetic<00:03:22.840> partner

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.250 
of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner
so<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.190> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.430> half<00:03:24.970> plant<00:03:25.420> half<00:03:25.720> mushroom
