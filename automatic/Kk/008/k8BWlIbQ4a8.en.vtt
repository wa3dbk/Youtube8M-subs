 It will be very long about 20 minutes 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.680
 approximately so I dedicate myself to 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.990
 show him everything and I need to do the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.330
 installation things that will also have its 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.580
 time is true so good I hope 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.720
 who understand me and thank you very much and 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 well let's start 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.700
 to begin with is that way training 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.660
 to be able to handle us in still 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 we need these three truth these three 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.940
 it is yellow that will seem normal this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 another and this one 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 each one has its different things by 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.400
 I ask you to look at them in the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.400
 these are the lives 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.960
 these are the minerals true be the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.460
 gasoline extra gasoline are both 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.500
 new hours that are around in 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.320
 our world with which put 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.140
 normal mealy oil pest not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 they laugh on the side 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.530
 in the translation into Spanish and this one the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.869
 crude and oil were made and it was 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.170
 can bite with all the topics there is no 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.909
 there's no problem as you chop it with one of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 these wood that means no 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.490
 I can apply with cold and other 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.760
 so there's no problem, let's go 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.310
 here he wanted the excuses to do the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.320
 trains and more can observe for example 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.110
 these are signs things to do those 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.510
 wagons trains and all that and this I 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.410
 this is not a mistake grouped 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.080
 trains this to see here this serves 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.600
 to make tracks or is this right? 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.180
 you put coal for example 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.540
 obviously I'm too lazy to do it now 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.770
 but I'm going to do it to show them 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.130
 because I did wrong so I need 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.230
 carbon 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.960
 with cook 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.810
 give to me 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 coal and iron and it's done now but 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.780
 I would need things that 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.780
 brother 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.850
 if it can be good I think I'll have to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.840
 break that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.410
 I do not think that this is already this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 wagon I need 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:50.580
 there were different so for example from 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:55.550
 visit this you need 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.550
 this or what puts it of this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.210
 and supposedly will have to go to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.450
 forward but 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.760
 must have a game like that like that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.239
 what he said 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.819
 because I'm going to have to go to the front 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.349
 we go 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.349
 it started with the study 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.940
 this gentleman that good already they will know a signal 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.850
 and trains 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.340
 that tender toy of all that love 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.780
 what worries me about this that what 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.080
 have to do is they are ways as you see 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.120
 but he does not do anything because he seems to be 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.120
 fenced 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.420
 but who knows 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.610
 well I will say with the good tutorial 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.810
 after all the gasoline everything 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.519
 that and well then here in more trains for 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.950
 that they can observe the train to dedicate to 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.280
 train this and what you well could not 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.670
 do in this mode is 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.220
 and intercalate intercalar trains because 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.410
 that's what was needed in this mode if 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.260
 you imagine what a trip has to be 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.599
 on a server with many people but 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.390
 can not be joined can not be joined 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.630
 trains made a garrón because it is 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.440
 terrific that you could measure true 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.150
 so well I hope you have them 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.100
 liked and now I say with the installation 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.800
 until now 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.540
 well before alterations I mean 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.850
 one thing that could achieve this 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.830
 work here below this there is no 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.590
 no other place 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.890
 with this removing everything put the universe 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.630
 in each as much with some spaces also 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.030
 this works underwater works in 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.970
 all parties no more than in this 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.500
 update consumes much more carbon 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
 that before 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.060
 and good just for that as you see here in 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.160
 the water lighting post and good 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.420
 I hope you liked these 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.920
 limited 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.460
 look with a coal all that is 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.510
 doing and also consume iron as 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.710
 you can see earlier so good 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.600
 I hope you liked the 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.940
 installation 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.210
 good to be in the installation of the mod 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.340
 and well what can I say, this is the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.150
 page with the description and also what 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.920
 I will leave another one that is his forum 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.470
 of minecraft for all the postmen that 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.010
 I said earlier that I do not 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.010
 judge please with the acquaintances placed 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.060
 low mode we carry audio bot point 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.150
 exe 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.440
 and we wait 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.330
 and there if they did not pick up a file of 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.390
 installer we pass it to the desk 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.510
 we close in internet we open of beginning 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.200
 run percent app data percent 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.200
 to accept 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:59.089
 point minecraft bean minecraft a point 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.990
 heart open and communicate archives we close 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:03.760
 the minecraft folder 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.130
 clear just doing sculpting on the 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.500
 camping scooter let's go to minecraft 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:13.420
 and we created a folder called mods mods 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:19.090
 have the have it created and if they have it 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:21.280
 it erases nothing inside and nothing 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.080
 they execute it 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.080
 but just as I am doing 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.620
 yes here is such if accept 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.830
 I'm installing as you can not see 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.889
 here because here I'm sure this part that 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.889
 is in Córdoba - medium files fail 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:53.339
 but do not wait a second that you have not 

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.289
 seen accept but run to this mud 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:00.529
 they have not agreed on another bar down here 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.529
 and then I have been the mod 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.400
 well let's wait a while longer than 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.400
 finish story 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.340
 and I say that this is much more 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.380
 easier than 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.139
 what is the installation manuel because there 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.600
 more possibilities than if the faces and 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:21.520
 being the annual that what this is 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.370
 a story that he uses like this 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.860
 new 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.410
 this is in the archives the sounds of 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.740
 the strangers all these are details 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.740
 no more 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.029
 one second 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.850
 and it is install 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.650
 we close everything and I hope that they have 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.630
 liked the video the boat I like 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.110
 favorites we do not see until the next 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.110
 goodbye
