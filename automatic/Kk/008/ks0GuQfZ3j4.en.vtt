soda in your hair it doesn't suds up and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.880 
soda in your hair it doesn't suds up and
you're<00:00:57.750> putting<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.289> hair<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> what

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you're putting it in your hair and what

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
you're putting it in your hair and what
you're<00:00:59.039> doing<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.670> spreading

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
you're doing is you're just spreading

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
you're doing is you're just spreading
the<00:01:00.780> baking<00:01:01.260> soda<00:01:01.469> through<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.250> hair<00:01:02.489> almost

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the baking soda through your hair almost

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.140 
the baking soda through your hair almost
just<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.090> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
just like this you know and it's just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
just like this you know and it's just
moving<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.900> oils<00:01:07.260> around<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.040> not

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
moving the oils around so it's not

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.800 
moving the oils around so it's not
totally<00:01:09.030> getting<00:01:09.270> rid<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.780> just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
totally getting rid of them it's just

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
totally getting rid of them it's just
taking<00:01:10.170> them<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.470> centred<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.130> roots

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
taking them all centred at your roots

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
taking them all centred at your roots
and<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.670> spreading<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.299> through<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.780> hair

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and it's spreading it through your hair

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
and it's spreading it through your hair
so<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> noticed<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.270> hair

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so and I noticed when I did that my hair

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
so and I noticed when I did that my hair
was<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> much<00:01:15.960> better<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> didn't<00:01:17.610> want

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
was so much better so what I didn't want

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.890 
was so much better so what I didn't want
to<00:01:17.850> continue<00:01:18.180> using<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> was

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to continue using it because it was

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
to continue using it because it was
fading<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.290> hair<00:01:19.470> color<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.130> too

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
fading my hair color a little bit too

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
fading my hair color a little bit too
much<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.290> still<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
much so what I do now is I'm still is
I'm<00:01:23.009> using<00:01:23.189> shampoo<00:01:23.670> again<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.180> using<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I'm using shampoo again but I'm using it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'm using shampoo again but I'm using it
in<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.380> same<00:01:25.680> way<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.520> getting<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> same
