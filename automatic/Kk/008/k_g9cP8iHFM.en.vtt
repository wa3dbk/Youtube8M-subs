00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.839 

so<00:04:59.440> more<00:04:59.650> important<00:05:00.130> than<00:05:00.280> actually<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
so more important than actually the

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.790 
so more important than actually the
project<00:05:01.240> itself<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:02.139> it's<00:05:02.229> de<00:05:02.349> partners

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
project itself I think it's de partners

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.740 
project itself I think it's de partners
and<00:05:03.069> I<00:05:03.310> think<00:05:03.520> we're<00:05:03.669> very<00:05:03.940> lucky<00:05:04.150> we<00:05:04.419> found<00:05:04.599> a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
and I think we're very lucky we found a

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.689 
and I think we're very lucky we found a
great<00:05:04.960> partner<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.440> Reid<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:06.400> we<00:05:06.550> can

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
collaborate with to really try to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.439

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
increase the level of education that

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.390
