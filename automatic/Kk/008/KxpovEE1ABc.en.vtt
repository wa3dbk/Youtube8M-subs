00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
let the sea compress it for one of these

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.510 
let the sea compress it for one of these
how<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.850> works<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:41.100> bar<00:00:41.489> right

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
how this works is this little bar right

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.979 
how this works is this little bar right
here<00:00:41.760> loosens<00:00:42.420> up

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.619 

mr.<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.879> goes<00:00:51.089> underneath<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
mr. right this this goes underneath the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
mr. right this this goes underneath the
cylinder<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.920> hold<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.339> bottom<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
cylinder and hold from the bottom of the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.500 
cylinder and hold from the bottom of the
valve<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> marry<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.510> tighten

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
valve you make this marry this tighten

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
valve you make this marry this tighten
it<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.589> when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> tighten<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it back up and then when you tighten it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.450 
it back up and then when you tighten it
it<00:00:59.309> pushes<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.760> valve<00:00:59.909> down<00:01:01.039> all<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.629> I

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
it pushes the valve down all right I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.289 
it pushes the valve down all right I
mean<00:01:05.460> while<00:01:05.640> here's<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.000> we're<00:01:06.090> talking

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
down you're going to put these back on

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.360 
down you're going to put these back on
the<00:03:48.700> barrel<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:53.560> show<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.830> guys<00:03:53.980> how<00:03:54.160> that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
the barrel to show you guys how that

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.180 
the barrel to show you guys how that
works<00:03:54.580> too<00:03:54.790> or<00:03:54.940> close<00:03:58.770> this<00:03:59.770> is<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.040> that

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
works too or close this is all that

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.710 
works too or close this is all that
keeps<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.520> valve<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.970> place<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.420> doesn't

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
keeps the valve in place it doesn't

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.540 
keeps the valve in place it doesn't
matter<00:04:01.870> what<00:04:02.110> manufacturer<00:04:02.860> it's<00:04:03.010> always<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
matter what manufacturer it's always the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.300 
matter what manufacturer it's always the
same<00:04:04.290> mister<00:04:05.290> some<00:04:05.500> weird<00:04:05.710> crap<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.250> don't

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
same mister some weird crap I don't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
same mister some weird crap I don't
never<00:04:06.580> heard<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:07.620> which<00:04:09.000> who<00:04:10.000> knows<00:04:10.030> who

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
never heard of which who knows who

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.180 
never heard of which who knows who
probably<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:14.500> right<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.620> there<00:04:14.980> goes<00:04:15.130> it

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
probably is all right so there goes it

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.330 
probably is all right so there goes it
holds<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.940> like<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.100> got<00:04:18.250> an

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
holds it just like that so you got an

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.710 
holds it just like that so you got an
idea<00:04:18.700> is<00:04:18.760> there's<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.239> Ridge<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.630> it

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
idea is there's a little Ridge and it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.960 
idea is there's a little Ridge and it
catches<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.200> Ridge<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:21.340> what<00:04:21.459> holds<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.880> in

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
catches that Ridge and what holds it in

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.670 
catches that Ridge and what holds it in
tight<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.750> here

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.029 

so<00:04:27.190> basically

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.859 

and<00:04:31.580> my<00:04:31.699> hands<00:04:31.939> are<00:04:32.089> nice<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.389> pretty<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:34.869> know

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:35.869 
and my hands are nice and pretty I know

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:37.359 
and my hands are nice and pretty I know
y'all<00:04:36.169> can't<00:04:36.439> believe<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.800> what<00:04:37.009> I'm<00:04:37.099> really

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:37.369 
y'all can't believe this what I'm really

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:43.839 
y'all can't believe this what I'm really
a<00:04:37.400> beauty<00:04:37.789> queen<00:04:39.759> not<00:04:41.289> forget<00:04:42.289> here<00:04:42.439> we<00:04:42.529> go<00:04:42.849> so

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
a beauty queen not forget here we go so

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.290 
a beauty queen not forget here we go so
basically<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.629> spring<00:04:45.319> is<00:04:46.189> going<00:04:46.339> to<00:04:46.460> be<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
basically that spring is going to be the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.339 
basically that spring is going to be the
compressor<00:04:47.629> is<00:04:47.779> going<00:04:47.809> to<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:48.020> pushing<00:04:48.199> the

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
compressor is going to be pushing the

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.739 
compressor is going to be pushing the
spring<00:04:48.740> down<00:04:48.949> on<00:04:49.069> the<00:04:49.189> head<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:50.449> when<00:04:50.539> you<00:04:50.629> go

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749 
spring down on the head and when you go
