and<00:01:44.229> when<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.070> looked<00:01:45.520> at<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.909> first<00:01:46.180> one

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
and when I looked at it the first one

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.600 
and when I looked at it the first one
was<00:01:46.390> kind<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.659> slow<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.409> was<00:01:48.340> trying<00:01:48.549> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
was kind of slow because I was trying to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.719 
was kind of slow because I was trying to
counter<00:01:48.970> his<00:01:49.060> job<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:51.189> know<00:01:51.310> because<00:01:51.490> he<00:01:51.580> gave

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
counter his job you know because he gave

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.310 
counter his job you know because he gave
me<00:01:51.820> an<00:01:51.909> opening<00:01:52.030> for<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.570> he<00:01:52.840> landed<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.200> few

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
me an opening for and he landed a few

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.719 
me an opening for and he landed a few
times<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:53.680> he<00:01:53.860> wouldn't<00:01:54.040> he<00:01:54.310> wouldn't<00:01:54.400> dare

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
times but he wouldn't he wouldn't dare

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.420 
times but he wouldn't he wouldn't dare
throw<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.170> often<00:01:56.170> by<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.130> thing<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.400> I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
throw it often by one thing that I

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.490 
throw it often by one thing that I
figured<00:01:57.850> out<00:01:58.000> when<00:01:58.150> i<00:01:58.240> jabbed<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:59.170> know<00:01:59.290> or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
figured out when i jabbed you know or

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.740 
figured out when i jabbed you know or
when<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.799> move<00:02:00.070> forward<00:02:00.520> he'll<00:02:01.180> drop<00:02:01.360> his<00:02:01.420> head

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
when I move forward he'll drop his head

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.960 
when I move forward he'll drop his head
like<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.290> like<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.650> total<00:02:02.979> show<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.820> know

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
like like like a total show you know

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.450 
like like like a total show you know
with<00:02:04.180> his<00:02:04.270> body<00:02:04.540> protected<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.770> figured<00:02:06.340> out

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
with his body protected so I figured out

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.830 
with his body protected so I figured out
in<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.579> third<00:02:06.790> round<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.479> move<00:02:07.689> around

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
in the third round that if I move around

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.830 
in the third round that if I move around
him<00:02:08.140> give<00:02:08.320> him<00:02:08.440> angles<00:02:09.000> he'll<00:02:10.000> follow<00:02:10.630> me

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
him give him angles he'll follow me

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.330 
him give him angles he'll follow me
around<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.470> he<00:02:11.560> wouldn't<00:02:11.739> know<00:02:11.920> where<00:02:12.100> I'm<00:02:12.190> at

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
around but he wouldn't know where I'm at

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220 
around but he wouldn't know where I'm at
so<00:02:12.820> that's<00:02:13.060> why<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.209> did<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> move<00:02:13.840> side<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.110> side

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
so that's why I did I move side to side

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.560 
so that's why I did I move side to side
every<00:02:14.650> time<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.799> went<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> left<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.640> would

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
every time I went to the left I would

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.410 
every time I went to the left I would
punch<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.440> go<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.799> right<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:18.970> when<00:02:19.390> I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
punch to go to the right and then when I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.520 
punch to go to the right and then when I
go<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.750> right<00:02:19.900> he<00:02:20.049> would<00:02:20.140> think<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
go to the right he would think that I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800 
go to the right he would think that I
was<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.799> left<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.459> that's<00:02:21.820> vice<00:02:22.269> versa<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
was in the left so that's vice versa you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.700 
was in the left so that's vice versa you
know<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.109> was<00:02:23.139> on<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.380> right

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
know when I was on the right

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.380 
know when I was on the right
he<00:02:24.100> thought<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.490> was<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.760> left<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.150> I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
he thought that I was on the left so I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.970 
he thought that I was on the left so I
figure<00:02:25.930> him<00:02:26.020> out<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.470> every<00:02:26.830> time

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
figure him out that way and every time

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.730 
figure him out that way and every time
that<00:02:27.040> he<00:02:27.250> turned<00:02:27.460> around<00:02:27.550> knowing<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.240> he

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that he turned around knowing that he

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.620 
that he turned around knowing that he
his<00:02:29.740> weight<00:02:29.950> was<00:02:30.190> forward<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.790> would<00:02:31.150> land<00:02:31.480> with

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
his weight was forward I would land with

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.210 
his weight was forward I would land with
the<00:02:31.750> right<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.140> most<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.740> with<00:02:33.070> an

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the right and most of all with an

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.400 
the right and most of all with an
uppercut<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.850> was<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> beautiful<00:02:35.050> left

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
uppercut that was a beautiful left

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.700 
uppercut that was a beautiful left
uppercut<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.860> got<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.030> job<00:02:37.300> done<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:38.020> was
