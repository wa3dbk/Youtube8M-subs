00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
of two components one of them is the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
of two components one of them is the
this<00:00:45.930> vehicle<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> mech

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this vehicle here and then the mech

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
this vehicle here and then the mech
right<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.879> normally<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.449> place<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
right there so normally you can place a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.360 
right there so normally you can place a
mech<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> back<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> vehicle<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:55.370> have

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
mech in the back of the vehicle to have

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.260 
mech in the back of the vehicle to have

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.170 
that's a great compliment who the other
ties<00:02:20.590> fire<00:02:21.010> mech<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.790> level<00:02:22.210> has<00:02:22.360> came<00:02:22.600> out

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
ties fire mech that level has came out

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040 
ties fire mech that level has came out
2013<00:02:25.180> as<00:02:25.450> well<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:28.050> Thunder

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
2013 as well so this is the Thunder

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.390 
2013 as well so this is the Thunder
Raider<00:02:29.640> vehicle<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.940> see<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:32.400> Ellis

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
Raider vehicle you can see that on Ellis

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.890 
Raider vehicle you can see that on Ellis
very<00:02:33.640> well<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.780> front<00:02:35.050> rest<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.900> rather

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
very well and the front rest and rather

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.590 
very well and the front rest and rather
effortlessly<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.920> can

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
effortlessly as you can

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.280 
effortlessly as you can
I<00:02:40.600> guess<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.070> vehicle<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:45.690> see<00:02:46.690> whether

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I guess from the vehicle and see whether

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.310 
I guess from the vehicle and see whether
it's<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.650> carpet<00:02:48.070> or<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.420> poster<00:02:49.420> board<00:02:49.600> that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
it's a carpet or the poster board that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's a carpet or the poster board that
it<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.590> sitting<00:02:50.890> all<00:02:51.010> right<00:02:51.160> now<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.750> model

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
it is sitting all right now so the model

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.820 
it is sitting all right now so the model
transforms<00:02:54.040> into<00:02:54.630> attack<00:02:55.630> mode<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.080> that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
transforms into attack mode and that

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.720 
transforms into attack mode and that
exposes<00:02:57.310> some<00:02:57.640> missiles<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.580> way

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
exposes some missiles here and the way

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.070 
exposes some missiles here and the way
it<00:03:00.880> works<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.510> sliding

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
it works is that just a sliding

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.280 
it works is that just a sliding
mechanism<00:03:05.290> created<00:03:06.250> by<00:03:06.640> tiles<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.450> what<00:03:08.260> I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
mechanism created by tiles and what I

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.470 
mechanism created by tiles and what I
think<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.739> pretty<00:03:08.980> cool<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:10.270> in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
think is pretty cool is that this is in

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.080 
think is pretty cool is that this is in
normally<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> hinge<00:03:11.709> piece<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.880> not

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
normally a hinge piece that is not

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.140 
normally a hinge piece that is not
designed<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.900> couple<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:15.130> clip<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:15.970> in

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
designed to couple with the clip but in

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.050 
designed to couple with the clip but in
this<00:03:16.330> case<00:03:17.130> horizontal<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.250> tight<00:03:18.519> enough<00:03:18.700> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
this case horizontal is tight enough so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.650 
this case horizontal is tight enough so
that<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:20.040> carpet<00:03:21.040> does<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.250> slide<00:03:21.730> down<00:03:21.790> so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
that the carpet does not slide down so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.270 
that the carpet does not slide down so
that's<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.959> great<00:03:23.200> cool<00:03:23.470> connection<00:03:23.769> method

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
that's a great cool connection method

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.850 
that's a great cool connection method
right<00:03:24.459> there<00:03:26.549> okay<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:27.610> on<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:29.110> vehicle<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
right there okay so on this vehicle the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.759 
right there okay so on this vehicle the
only<00:03:30.100> notable<00:03:30.880> parts<00:03:31.330> are<00:03:31.540> these<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.440> frames

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
only notable parts are these a frames

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.740 
only notable parts are these a frames
the<00:03:33.250> modified<00:03:34.140> wedges<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:36.299> they<00:03:37.299> only<00:03:37.480> come

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
the modified wedges and they only come

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.530 
the modified wedges and they only come
in<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:38.019> feeling<00:03:38.440> Dargo<00:03:38.769> sets<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:40.120> lego

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
in a feeling Dargo sets and the lego

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.620 
in a feeling Dargo sets and the lego
movie<00:03:40.630> sets<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:41.860> if<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.850> have<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> use<00:03:43.269> for<00:03:43.480> them
