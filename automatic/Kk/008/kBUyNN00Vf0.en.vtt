00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello and welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.370
 of the lotu program in which we are going to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 start installing our systems 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 operatives in the last tutorial les them 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.200
 teach how to install virtual box 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.759
 you can also use 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.469
 any other virtual machine if 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
 you want or you can install yours 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.859
 operating systems in a new 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 computer the steps to follow are 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.800
 practically the same so over there 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.689
 we go 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 to start we will install windows 8 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.960
 because I have received many questions from 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 people who had problems with the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 installation of windows 8 so what 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.830
 first thing we have to do is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.040
 download the iso image of windows 8 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.680
 for this we go to our browser and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.820
 our preferred search engine in this case 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 crow and google here we will write nothing more 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.829
 windows 8 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 google already offers us windows 8 because 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 many people have sought and entered 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.449
 this link where it puts windows 8 release 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 preview because as you guys know uy 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.989
 we still have not come out completely and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.150
 like the microsoft ones are very nice we 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.860
 offer a preview preview so that 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.080
 we can try on our own 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.750
 computer going down a little we got here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.450
 until try it now and click on it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 here they already offer us iso images that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 I just commented and in this case the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 iso images of windows 8 we download a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 bit more pro low and here we have 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 different languages 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 I suppose very much that you are going to want 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170
 in Spanish but you can also 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 download in English French German Japanese 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 If you know one of these languages, it's not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 it's wrong to try it I do not know what 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 interesting is that we have a version 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.899
 64-bit and a 32-bit version I 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 the truth is that to prove I have 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.190
 downloaded the 32 bit version by the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 simple fact that it is rather more 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.710
 small than the 64- bit version and for 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.330
 to prove the truth is that it does not matter here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 down very important we have the key 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.310
 of the product that we will need when 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.740
 let's install the product 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.329
 it's quite simple you download one of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.490
 these two versions I'm not going to 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.409
 do because I do not have downloaded and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.960
 When you do not have downloaded, we go to 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.909
 next step now well the next 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.189
 step depends on whether you are going to install 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.950
 your operating system in a 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.420
 computer or in the virtual machine let's 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.550
 let's see where we have the image and it's me 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 I have it saved here and as you can see 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.959
 it looks like a weird file a file 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.030
 zip the only thing that ends in iso point like 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 you can imagine to install this in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.080
 another computer on a new computer or 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.180
 as the second operating system in 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 your computer will need a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.549
 external storage device or 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.680
 see a cd or a usb in these tutorials 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.049
 I will not explain how to make a 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.080
 operating system is loaded from a usb 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.150
 to install it on a computer but what 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.819
 What I can tell you is that if 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.250
 you click on the right button and you are going to open 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.900
 with here you have a recorder 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.000
 windows disk images so 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 less in windows 7 and I think in windows 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.260
 seen also the only thing that you have to 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.329
 to do is click here and record your 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.150
 image on a DVD because as you have 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.760
 seen windows 8 has 2.5 or 3 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.829
 gb or something out there depends the version that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.890
 you go down and it will not fit on a cd 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.079
 because a cd is 700 megs then 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.750
 You will need a DVD instead if you 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.879
 you download your point for example you goat 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.439
 on a cd because they are exactly 700 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.269
 you do me good as he just said this 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.400
 depends on the size of your iso image 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.470
 but it does not matter if it's a cd or a dvd 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.269
 because it will work exactly the same 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.709
 and for everyone else that you want 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.349
 install your operating system on 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.909
 a virtual machine over there let's go to 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.799
 move on to our virtual machine and how 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.930
 you see I already have a windows 8 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.639
 installed here we can install so many 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.950
 operating systems as we want and 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.769
 also of the same type so let's 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.450
 click on new and we see a 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.459
 creation assistant the truth is that 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.409
 they are very nice we will have to give you a 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.560
 name what name are we going to give him because I 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.810
 I'm going to give you windows 8 tout for 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.629
 tutorial there's down here we'll have to 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.659
 choosing is a microsoft system 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.970
 windows yes and it is windows 8 already if we put 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.409
 win 8 the system will recognize what 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.659
 we want to install though anyway 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.140
 we can enter here and choose what 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.700
 we want 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.280
 I'm going to leave it like that and I'm going to click on it 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.720
 in next 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.550
 now we move to a point that is the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.069
 ram memory our operating system 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.010
 it needs ram memory as much as memory 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.480
 from our hard drive and for that 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.690
 we have to share what we have 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.519
 physically on our computer with the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.019
 digital operating system that is the one 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.080
 let's install I recommend always 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.760
 stay within this green zone 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.830
 it depends on how much ram you have this area 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.930
 green will be bigger or smaller and what 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.720
 What I usually do is stay more or 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.210
 less around here you can also upload more 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.520
 but the fact is that good I soil it 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.620
 leave here in three more rooms or 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.750
 unless for the moment it's going to be enough 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.480
 memory and what was said against more memory 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.540
 have on your computer more you can 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.160
 share with your operating system 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.810
 let's give the next one in this 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.050
 next point will create a disk 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.150
 Hard will be a virtual hard drive here 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.880
 we have boot hard drive create 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.530
 new virtual hard drive and in my case you 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.210
 we are going to give 25 gigabytes not 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.400
 Worry if team or something else because 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.200
 this point will also depend on the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.390
 hard disk capacity that you have in 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.550
 your computer we go to the next 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.030
 point and now in this next point what 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.400
 what is it 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.130
 asking is what kind of hard drive 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.960
 virtual we want to create, I usually leave 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.640
 always in virtual box discrimen 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.530
 practically because I do not have another 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.030
 virtual machine system installed in 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.070
 my computer means that I'm not going to 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.780
 have to share this virtual system 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.240
 with other machines so I'm going to 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.790
 leave in virtual box this image and go 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.190
 a next apart from the type of hard drive 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.890
 he is also asking us if we want 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.680
 a fixed or dynamically reserved size 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.540
 it means that if we are working with 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.270
 our operating system and we need 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.310
 more than those 25 gigs for our 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.100
 system is going to get more and more 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.840
 gigas if we choose a fixed size when 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.550
 fill our hard drive and we will not go 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.710
 to be able to add anything more like in a 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.420
 normal computer and I'm going to 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.370
 leave in reserved dynamically but 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.590
 you can choose what you want 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.570
 finally asks us where 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.000
 we want to save our system and 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.620
 apart from that it gives us the option to give it 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.230
 more gigas of hard drive to our 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.210
 system if it is that I want it here not 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.710
 I change nothing I leave everything as 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.600
 comes because in this way I know 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.180
 exactly where I have my systems that 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.720
 they're all together and the 25 gigs are 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.420
 more than 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.490
 to try for example windows 8 so 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.870
 that we went to the next one and in this 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.850
 last screen tells us all the 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.650
 points that we have chosen and what we have 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.990
 created and we will have finished with the 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.970
 creation we give you to create and there will be 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.410
 created the operating system and now 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.030
 after creating our system 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.220
 operative will create us a machine 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.050
 virtual to use the system 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.200
 that we just configured we give to 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.330
 create and as you can see here below 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.400
 Windows 8 appears 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.170
 which is the system that we just created 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.490
 and here on the right we have all the 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.560
 properties that we ourselves have 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.390
 chosen good as I see that this tutorial 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.760
 it's getting a little long 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.500
 I'm going to leave it here and we'll continue in 7 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.440
 tutorial booting our machine 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.930
 virtual linking to our image 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.200
 iso to finally be able to configure 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.760
 our windows 8 and be able to try it and a 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.100
 thing else before finishing this tutorial 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.570
 is that you can follow the steps we have 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.600
 followed for any operating system 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.850
 either from windows whether from linux either 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.040
 of mac any operating system that 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.750

 previously and you already have your machine 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.240
