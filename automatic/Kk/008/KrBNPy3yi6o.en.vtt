00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
I mean that's just kind of common sense

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
and that's just how things go but it

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.720 
and that's just how things go but it
definitely<00:04:06.060> does<00:04:06.419> stand<00:04:06.690> true<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> Suarez<00:04:07.260> um

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730

there<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:18.690> he<00:04:18.810> most<00:04:19.019> likely<00:04:19.109> should<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.859> been

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
there so he most likely should have been

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.620 
there so he most likely should have been
able<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> do<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.519> but<00:04:20.940> um<00:04:21.060> he<00:04:21.239> actually<00:04:21.389> shot

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630

which<00:04:23.280> was<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> little<00:04:23.760> puzzling<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.240> me<00:04:24.270> but

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
which was a little puzzling to me but

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.160 
which was a little puzzling to me but
nonetheless<00:04:24.719> I'm<00:04:25.169> you'd<00:04:25.560> figure<00:04:25.860> with

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
nonetheless I'm you'd figure with

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.410 
nonetheless I'm you'd figure with
finishing<00:04:26.830> at<00:04:26.980> 94<00:04:27.580> shooting<00:04:27.940> um<00:04:28.090> you

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
finishing at 94 shooting um you

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.090 
finishing at 94 shooting um you
definitely<00:04:28.660> do<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.080> little<00:04:29.350> bit<00:04:29.530> better<00:04:29.710> but

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
definitely do a little bit better but

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.770 
definitely do a little bit better but
