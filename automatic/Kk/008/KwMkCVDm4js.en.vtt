 duel top automatically adjusts the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.640
 heat output required and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.480
 minimizes consumption to the maximum 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.480
 start winter mode

 the water is now warming to 70 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.689
 degrees and the interior of the vehicle in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 function of your settings but this is

 warms the itop duo as quickly as possible 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.320
 always heats the inside of the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.149
 vehicle 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 only when the inside of the 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.840
 vehicle has reached the temperature 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.600
 desired that the heating power 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 focuses on the water heater in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 function of the outside temperature and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.850
 of the water temperature it can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.740
 it will take more than an hour to heat 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.479
 70 degree water 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.549
 know how is the process of 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.649
 heating let's take a look in the 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.360
 heating is pushed back by the 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.729
 fan is heated in the

 vehicle 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.080
 the water is already starting to heat up in the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.140
 hot water heater that 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 escapes but as soon as the inside of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.939
 vehicle has reached the temperature 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.549
 desired 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.530
 the fan stops and the full 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.960
 heat output heats the water in 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.090
 the water heater to 70 degrees when the water 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.080
 and inside the vehicle or reaches the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.909
 desired temperature 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.220
 the duo hold up automatically maintains 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.640
 this level of heat and you can you 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.640
