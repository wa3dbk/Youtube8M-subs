and of course the unstoppable SC big gun

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.120 
and of course the unstoppable SC big gun
first<00:01:12.840> off<00:01:13.049> I'll<00:01:13.200> show<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> rotation

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
first off I'll show you the rotation

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.330 
first off I'll show you the rotation
followed<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.850> action

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
followed by some action

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
followed by some action
so<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.460> chain<00:01:17.729> grenade<00:01:18.119> launcher<00:01:18.600> clips

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so it's chain grenade launcher clips

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
so it's chain grenade launcher clips
with<00:01:19.350> killer<00:01:19.619> instincts<00:01:20.130> followed<00:01:20.610> by<00:01:20.729> rocket

now the good thing about advanced

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
now the good thing about advanced
mechanics<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.430> new<00:01:38.610> powers<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.210> one

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
mechanics with these new powers is one

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
mechanics with these new powers is one
the<00:01:39.930> rotations<00:01:40.439> nice<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> easy

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the rotations nice and easy

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149 
the rotations nice and easy
-<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:42.090> always<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.570> outstanding<00:01:42.869> damage<00:01:43.470> but
