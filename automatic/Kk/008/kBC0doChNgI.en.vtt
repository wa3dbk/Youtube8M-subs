time to do it and when I am killing

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.250 
time to do it and when I am killing
bandos<00:00:34.120> it's<00:00:34.330> usually<00:00:34.690> maybe<00:00:34.870> one<00:00:35.140> or<00:00:35.230> two

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
bandos it's usually maybe one or two

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.979 
bandos it's usually maybe one or two
trips<00:00:35.620> on<00:00:35.769> stream<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.420> am<00:00:37.540> really<00:00:37.720> cut

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
trips on stream because I am really cut

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.170 
trips on stream because I am really cut
on<00:00:38.170> time<00:00:38.410> which<00:00:38.650> kind<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:38.890> sucks<00:00:39.160> but<00:00:39.489> that's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
on time which kind of sucks but that's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.670 
on time which kind of sucks but that's
basically<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.600> story<00:00:40.870> behind<00:00:41.079> it<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.500> no

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
basically the story behind it and no

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.210 
basically the story behind it and no
it's<00:00:41.949> not<00:00:42.309> 1000<00:00:43.150> video<00:00:43.449> skills<00:00:43.930> it's<00:00:44.350> 1000

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
it's not 1000 video skills it's 1000

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.060 
it's not 1000 video skills it's 1000
bandos<00:00:46.119> kill<00:00:46.570> count<00:00:46.960> okay<00:00:47.500> it's<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.830> kill

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
bandos kill count okay it's the kill

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
bandos kill count okay it's the kill
count<00:00:48.309> which<00:00:48.879> means<00:00:49.180> for<00:00:49.540> kill<00:00:49.780> count<00:00:50.049> per<00:00:50.979> uh

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
count which means for kill count per uh

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.259 
count which means for kill count per uh
/<00:00:52.629> bandos<00:00:53.080> kill<00:00:53.409> so<00:00:54.159> I<00:00:54.189> guess<00:00:54.519> technically<00:00:55.089> it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
/ bandos kill so I guess technically it

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.060 
/ bandos kill so I guess technically it
could<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.510> called<00:00:55.780> looting<00:00:56.170> 250<00:00:56.739> bandeau

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
could be called looting 250 bandeau

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.160 
could be called looting 250 bandeau
skills<00:00:57.369> but<00:00:57.850> it's<00:00:58.000> not<00:00:58.150> it's<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.720> thousand<00:00:59.080> kill

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
skills but it's not it's a thousand kill

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.020 
skills but it's not it's a thousand kill
count<00:00:59.379> so<00:00:59.619> I'm<00:00:59.890> gonna<00:01:00.129> go<00:01:00.280> get<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.549> loot<00:01:00.760> and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
count so I'm gonna go get the loot and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:33.109 
count so I'm gonna go get the loot and
I'll<00:01:01.689> be<00:01:01.780> back

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
now or so thanksgiving break should be

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
now or so thanksgiving break should be
coming<00:04:24.390> up<00:04:24.540> which<00:04:25.350> means<00:04:25.530> we<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.950> lot<00:04:26.250> of

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
coming up which means we have a lot of

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.160 
coming up which means we have a lot of
time<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.670> stream<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.120> i<00:04:27.180> should<00:04:27.390> be<00:04:27.420> doing<00:04:27.600> a

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
time to stream so i should be doing a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.200 
time to stream so i should be doing a
lot<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.920> streaming<00:04:29.340> over<00:04:29.580> thanksgiving<00:04:30.180> break

I<00:04:33.570> actually<00:04:34.050> get<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> unless<00:04:34.800> something<00:04:35.250> you

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
I actually get to unless something you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.580 
I actually get to unless something you
know<00:04:35.850> happens<00:04:36.330> something<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:37.020> know<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.290> get

busy<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:37.890> whatever<00:04:38.160> which<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.820> probably<00:04:39.120> won't

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
busy or whatever which I probably won't

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.910 
busy or whatever which I probably won't
because<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.870> really<00:04:40.260> don't<00:04:40.440> do<00:04:40.590> much<00:04:40.620> with<00:04:40.860> my

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
because I really don't do much with my

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.360 
because I really don't do much with my
life<00:04:41.190> but<00:04:41.900> that's<00:04:42.900> not<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.230> point<00:04:43.470> yesterday

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.990 
i did a video on real world trading a
few<00:04:46.590> people<00:04:46.830> got<00:04:46.920> a<00:04:46.980> little<00:04:47.160> upset<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.790> guess

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
few people got a little upset I guess

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.990 
few people got a little upset I guess
maybe<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.720> didn't<00:04:48.960> explain<00:04:48.990> myself<00:04:49.470> enough<00:04:50.040> it

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
maybe I didn't explain myself enough it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.550 
maybe I didn't explain myself enough it
