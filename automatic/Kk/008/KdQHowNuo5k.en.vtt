00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.589
 they really 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 They have received me with much affection with 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.630
 a lot of kindness talk to us about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.330
 the things that you have to presume that is 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.160
 obviously nairo and other good others 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.180
 great cyclists of the region 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.880
 I think I need to go sit down 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.710
 maybe to eat with then with the people 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 to know a little more, not because 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.580
 I'm just soaking up that of the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.839
 food culture on the way up 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.519
 here thank you very much I was welcomed by the wind 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.960
 and also the height but I think they are 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.640
 part not of the charm that this 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 land for cycling too 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.740
 I think it has been very interesting and 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.420
 also very intense because in a few months 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.240
 the project has been made 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 managed to get the viewers of the 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.780
 international cyclist union and good 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.840
 because that simply tells us that there 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.400
 Many will surely be some 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.680
 things that work in the way is left 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.630
 time but 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.610
 and now that they come for a second 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.260
 review the most likely is that this 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 land can receive that championship the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.560
 world 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.060
 hopefully yes of course simple I come 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.189
 delighted of the life invited for me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.549
 the world championships are also a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.500
 sensational and good event well according 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.970
 Cycling is developing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 Colombian as it gets closer and closer 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 the one of them is left with one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.210
 medal in the route because good and 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 we know that we have had the time 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.679
 and it's been had before so I wish that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.679
 be for when they are at home 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 I see it super super motivated I see it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.430
 in addition in a form of growth in 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.990
 how about your arms to your curve 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.970
 necessarily he would have to get to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.310
 an 80 90 percent in the first week 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.800
 to be able to develop the rest in the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.810
 second and the third I think it has been 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.360
 also very wise the way it is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.100
 has prepared because it is only 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.380
 taking a place of competition before 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.960
 many people take two or three races he 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.850
 They have not had to do that we 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.860
 he showed it in the turn so with the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.350
 return to burgos will be more than enough 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.420
 so that those engines start in 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.160
 action and the second week of the return 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.459
 Spain, we can see it really in 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.459
 fullness 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.880
 Well, I want to wish everyone to follow 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.040
 keeping this city very nice 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.580
 they are very fond of everything 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.070
 do with regard to making it grow 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.990
 Well take care and of course 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
 support your cyclists a lot because they 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.910
 they will bring a lot of pride they already knew 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.920

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.870
