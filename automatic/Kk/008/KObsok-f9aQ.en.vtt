00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.269
 both welcome back and today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 it's about the topic completely wrong 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.270
 Objective of especially trainings 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 beginner paradigm 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.820
 you are just beginning or wanted 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 even start exercising 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 You are slim, but you realize 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.859
 somehow the muscles do not look that way 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 nice out especially on the stomach sixpack 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.090
 is your first thought so if I am 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.420
 Too tight somehow too much fat off 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.489
 what do i have to do a diet why 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.930
 of course you think that was the most 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.210
 people or many students maybe 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 look out say I have one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.510
 made diet I have decreased and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 my abdominal muscles came out 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 the problem of a whole thing is who 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.300
 It's a workout 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 beginner and it is one 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 someone advanced some 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.660
 has trained years and almost 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.109
 that has built up what he defines 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.789
 can 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.920
 you can not compare that with 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.359
 somebody the whole life never trains 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 but only one hand touched and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.100
 maybe a few weeks 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.049
 that is, if you are dieting 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 if you define something from word 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.180
 no matter what it is then it has to be there and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.890
 if I have never trained 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 which train a few weeks and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 I did not build any muscles 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 then define from 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 then there is no reason a diet 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 to make and muscles clear in one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.340
 few weeks on so that portmann over 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 months and years on the one long 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.890
 process is not going so fast 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.259
 maybe start a bit at the beginning 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.189
 faster than with advanced ones though 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.170
 under a year 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.659
 if you might be energetically blessed 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.119
 So is at least one year lasted her 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.640
 nothing great have built what 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 it pays off to define the thinks 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.869
 Whatever your diet will be 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.030
 muscle loss no matter how much protein or 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.159
 how well you train so if 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.570
 I have built a kilo and make 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.920
 the cinema loser again there I am yes 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.340
 right where I started 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.079
 makes zero sense and if I eh 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 slim and then same and then 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.840
 diet is so less to eat and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 train which even slimmer and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 to beat me 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.590
 So it does not make sense to me 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 not athletic or even on 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.150
 So that means we're the wrong one 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.400
 steps skipped the most important 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.100
 steps which need do to her 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.340
 It's not my goal to come 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.030
 You do not see belly muscles where I am 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.310
 has to do diet 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 no, but you have to have a tree 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 this one I do not have any 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 muscular moment no grossarth the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.970
 Great muscles around her too 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.190
 to define the times at all 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 Muscles do not see you only sees them 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.060
 if i save on it too i am right 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.470
 because what do I do first I start 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.680
 to train 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.300
 eat decently nobody said if 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 I am massively behaving which of 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.980
 fat phase do not gnaw 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.300
 but just a little bit eighth 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.890
 need to eat more proteins 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.660
 that can be enough for most people 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.720
 cover as a training start one has 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.610
 always the bus at the same time even if you 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.080
 Muscle also builds fat 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.760
 does not have to work 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.890
 So working means the first thing 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.410
 her power is her catch the first few 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.030
 Murder to properly train it 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.489
 decent and looks how is your body 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.290
 develops so to speak that will be in 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.209
 hall is yes then it will take a year 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 Anna maybe even two years old 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.620
 last and then if he really does 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.570
 I have successfully trained correctly 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.209
 has just ripped the applications for 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.980
 and especially decent 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.269
 then you have eaten on each one 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.019
 If a bit muscles built up 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.810
 to have 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.760
 that will be ten fifteen in any case 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.410
 kilo arrive weight laidback 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.060
 Dont ever be dedicated to being muscles 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.440
 after this 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.660
 and then you can look the mirror 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.220
 and say okay maybe I have one 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.200
 eaten a little too much yes maybe 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.489
 want to have taken too much 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.590
 maybe I can now times a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.180
 who think or to a definition, 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.840
 phase around what we now in the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.950
 worked out again last years 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.079
 to define 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.760
 then you can do it then you can do it 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.780
 but if I do not think 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.650
 then successfully built muscle 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.810
 is the thought of a the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.019
 Definitions diet absolutely weak market 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.820
 So go and make yourself 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.890
 thought about where you are 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.620
 where do you want to go and what do you have to do for it 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.549
 do and what is what is yours 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.880
 starting situation you have at all 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.560
 to define something most 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.270
 nix are beginnings there have not so 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.280
 That's why I can think of you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.740
 Above all, do not be dazzled 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.980
 this whole fitness industry through this 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.230
 all the people in there in front of you 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.400
 with a huge muscle and sixpack 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.190
 and even introduce and present 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.860
 and tell something that's all 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.660
 nice and good but there are still steps 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.550
 far away because you have to go first 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.350
 ever start running 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.770
 You can not say I want one 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.320
 make step and 100 meters in 10 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.670
 seconds 9 seconds run times 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.020
 you are capable of two at a time 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.360
 steps to go if he still 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.410
 stands and says yes I want the victory 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.370
 but sometimes it does 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.530
 started walking 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.240
 So step by step you have to first 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.400
 take the first steps 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.990
 I know since impatient understand that 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.340
 also yes i was also young i had 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.900
 I also started sometime 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.750
 to train yes and I wanted too 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.790
 right on the first day such a breast or 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.370
 so poor or so have a hot belly 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.040
 but unfortunately that works 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.750
 not just because the base is not there 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.490
 is and the base you have to first 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.200
 work out 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.060
 you want to build a beautiful sandcastle 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.520
 but there is no sand so would have 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.440
 first go and sand the clay and that 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.510
 lasts well yes it will certainly be one 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.910
 a few months , even years 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.130
 and then you can think about it 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.190
 if that is necessary at all and how 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.230
 said you do not have to eat your fill 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.640
 it speaks none of them that their fat 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.850
 it should be that here without steadily 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.380
 You should be able to look slow 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.360
 just a little bit more of maybe 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.040
 even extends to what you eat to 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.650
 just that the muscles get better 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.100
 come and as I said everything else is 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.270
 weakly mischievous and just plain 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.770
 A waste of time is the luster 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.540
 waste of time which at the end of this 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.240
 comes out yes if you say someday 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.830
 okay I prefer first mass phase 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.110
 first made me up now 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.150
 Muscle building then becomes concentrated 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.370
 you notice six eight or ten or so 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.840
 maybe even two years with nonsense 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.230
 just disappear on the spot 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.320
 wear because he is easy and self 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.170
 hinders quasi yes because he wants something 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.460
 what indeed has no basis okay, I got it 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.410
 become too long again 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.880
 I 'm a little bit so good 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.200
 drunk yes so a bit 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.330
 understand if we still ask questions 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.900
 under the video post otherwise that was 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.830
 it from me 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.830
 up soon
