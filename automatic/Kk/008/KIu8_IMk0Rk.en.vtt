00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Good day man who 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.830
 I went to this video that I mean my only 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 subscriber well or some kind of person 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.570
 who stumbled upon this video 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.990
 in this video tutorial, I'll tell you how 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 install these launcher in order to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 play some builds 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 any streamers and some 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 ordinary players 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 Well, in general, it does not matter immediately you came 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 to the website and these launcher dot com I just 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 I recommend registering for this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 I donâ€™t know why but personally 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.100
 did immediately I went to the forum 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 so here you need forums and here 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 registered for what 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 registered but now I know for sure 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 what if suddenly what problem will be 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 Launcher is necessary or with the assembly or some kind of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 mod will stop working on the assembly then I 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 just going to this forum not with 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.699
 happy to answer and I know what to answer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.590
 well in general we register 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.320
 can here not look was considered but I 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.090
 just recommend you this one you need 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.570
 find the davlat tab and click it 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 well lower a little lower here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.299
 this is a little cloud written it was appreciate 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 stammering something happened to me not 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 so in general three are suggested here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 options that you can download for 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 his or her operating system 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 file ie installer 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 You can download the operating system 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 that is, if you have a magician you do not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.860
 you will download for windows correctly 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.500
 Well, in general, you can immediately understand 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 count what the snare that is here in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.030
 Generally what updates were with this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.700
 launcher and so on so i'll just be 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 showing I will not show everything Valya 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.840
 download there any garbage I just will 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 show what you did here yourself 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 Launcher opened here you appear 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 Such a console is writing for example 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.020
 when was started at what time at 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.079
 how many seconds one or the other 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 launcher that is the name of the launcher itself 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.380
 its version is your operating system 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.160
 how many will you call a version lick the version 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.470
 java then 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.130
 java directory itself as bit 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.560
 java 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.600
 well in general so on and so forth I 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.970
 I recommend you guys right away if u 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.360
 you have a 4 bit system 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 download java for 64 bit system 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.790
 because the launcher is almost all based 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.280
 on this operating 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.160
 8 more precisely on this exhibition bit system 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.070
 as though here so it so generally you understood 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.500
 but in general, you launched this launcher for you 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.400
 it comes out like a window here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.170
 There are those here here here here here so have 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.950
 I immediately wrote this console 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730
 your fruit 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.480
 see here you can read 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 news about the very beginning is written 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.730
 for example here here is supposedly here almost 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.610

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.760

 You can by the way the name of the assembly itself 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.520
 change to your name then 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.760

 and 3 well, it is clear that it is like 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.850
 the person who shoots this assembly yes 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.660
 that is, you can refer to them 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.460

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.750
 there you can see here you can then tailor the server 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.120
 there you can download with friends here 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.920

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.370
 launcher 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.850
 that is , it will be the name of another 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.260

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.150
 malfunctioning and activated meaning it is like 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.620

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.510
