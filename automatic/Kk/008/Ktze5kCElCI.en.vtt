the<00:00:03.990> beloved<00:00:04.350> IB<00:00:04.680> likes<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.190> spit<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.490> pure<00:00:05.640> at

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the beloved IB likes to spit the pure at

the beloved IB likes to spit the pure at
table<00:00:06.060> up<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.390> four<00:00:06.720> different<00:00:06.990> ways<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.560> let's

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
table up in four different ways so let's

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.419 
table up in four different ways so let's
look<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:07.980> them<00:00:08.069> one<00:00:08.340> by<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:09.030> pretty<00:00:09.179> fast

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
look at them one by one it's pretty fast

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.910 
look at them one by one it's pretty fast
okay<00:00:11.429> that's<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> s-block<00:00:12.650> don't<00:00:13.650> forget<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
okay that's the s-block don't forget the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.630 
okay that's the s-block don't forget the

groups are numbered 1 to 18 and the
groups<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.230> columns<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.150> worry<00:00:30.269> about

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
