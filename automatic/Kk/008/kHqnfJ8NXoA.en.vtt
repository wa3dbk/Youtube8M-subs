00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.320

 this we had a lunch here in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.240
 tabacum 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.500
 really range a little early and not 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.059
 only because we could go through the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.309
 hotel before coming because no 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.660
 We advance about 20 minutes when 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.150
 come to leave he gave me an alert of the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.390
 security of the somewhat serious case of a 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.320
 threat series that we had received 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.850
 specifically the restoration to the channel and 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.460
 a hug to the mayor do not forget 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.610
 save everyone 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.320
 textually says the message that you have 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.140
 thought that let it saved the people 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.070
 be wrong we kill you together with leash and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.079
 you will see it the 16 repeat it the message already 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.780
 You will see it today as many people die 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.490
 today in the park is seen us 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.619
 we did this every day 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.780
 we 're going to be scared by these things the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 problem was that a tracking of the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.860
 number 0 95 94 97 138 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.390
 if the call had been made on a radio 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.250
 500 meters the demonstration is the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.930
 person who sends the messages to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.350
 near the place where the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.750
 event 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 consequently the level of risk went up 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.450
 substantially if this came from guayas 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.270
 but take precautions the presidential 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.030
 He advised me to surprise the activities 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.310
 that they put together in the hotel because I'm going to do 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.320
 several people involved are being 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 doing investigations of the case it 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.220
 located the owner 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.220
 phone is being investigated 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 in fact the calls what they see 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 in fact this number in any case given 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 It is serious 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.360
 especially what 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.730
 the call instead of the event we had 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.250
 that suspend the presence of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.780
 President 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.670
 at lunch so I ask 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.050
 apologies to the hundreds of people who 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.210
 organizations were present 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.100
 neighborhood social organizations 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.640
 peasants of workers and so on 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.580
 excuse the opportunity again 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.230
 to be able to share in moments like this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.209
 we are saddened by the fact that we have not 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.160
 could share lunch against 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.840
 people were there but you have to 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.250
 follow the security protocol and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.080
 Exactly what is 6 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.360
 to exist these to see the whole subject and 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.420
 to thank the security of all 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.490
 alerted and protocol was met in his 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.490
 fullness is practically what 6
