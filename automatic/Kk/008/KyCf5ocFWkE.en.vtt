00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
 hello again I'm dark measure 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.440
 and this is another one of my videos of analyzing comedy counting games 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.170
 well in this video they will see what I was saying when I analyzed the kingdom 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.600
 hearts changas memory because at last I bring you a game of nintendo 64 but this 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.590
 once you have a surprise that before uploading the video I made sure they can 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.210
 stay happy 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.319
 today we are going to analyze the game legend of zelda the ocarina of time 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.979
 damn I do not want to put the video because I would be ruined I walk the 

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.579
 surprise so these minutes are just going to look at the avatar xd xd xd must 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 Obviously anger runs video 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.400
 you have already noticed the surprise 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.670
 so is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.700
 the game I'm showing you is the legend of zelda the ocarina of time 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.850
 playstation 2 version no lie is just a game to restart the game 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 and make it look much better 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.739
 in the description could put in file the file that I take the trouble of 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.550
 climb for you there are certainly the requirements to run the game 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 they are fluidly in the description too 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.100
 good let's start the analysis 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.750
 when we started the game 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 our wording to customize our name 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.450
 something very characteristic of this saga the truth I do not know why I get to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.590
 explain all this if the legend of zelda is obvious that it is a great game 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.969
 but good this video is directed for those who have not played yet let's continue 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.760
 the game is available in several languages 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.600
 but yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.619
 if you are going to use this textures payment I think it is only compatible with the theft that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.140
 it comes inside which means it is in English but good a little English 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 does not harm anyone xdxd must 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.210
 now well and that's it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.430
 also and coinciding times and if they are very well accompanied by solids 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.170
 It is a very good way 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.240
 in fact I think he 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.399
 characters speak or are they mute and say cubillos ecuador did this text 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.520
 for communicating 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520
 xd xd 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.649
 although the original game has good graphics imagine playing it respect 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.089
 used hahahaha 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:26.819
 the scenarios we love being empty there is a lot of color and landscapes are left 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.709
 very well every stage has many sound effects that accompany and 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.439
 animate that environment and the best almost all the objects and characters of the scenario 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.399
 can be used, that is, you can interact with almost everything 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.889
 from reading signs to destroying 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.279
 next to davis you almost killed yourself xd xd xd defense 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:56.399
 well as I mentioned every corner of this game has details color life xd 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.749
 but there are more most of the scenarios are long and extensive so 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.939
 that we will have a lot to explore 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.609
 We can travel to various cities and regions to fulfill missions there 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.969
 for those who say that this is not a role-playing game because for them this is 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.149
 a role play any game in which you represent a character and take your 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.769
 place in that world because I really do not remember who was the one who said in a 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.689
 video that the role-playing games were the ones that were fought by turns xds 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.660
 besides almost all the things we can do in the game gives us absolute 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.109
 freedom you have to think about since the game is full of productions and it's 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.370
 quite long let's put it about five hours to finish it without counting the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.509
 cinematic 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.509
 now I will show you the inventory 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.290
 in the inventory we will find our weapons objects 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.489
 etc. status 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.469
 good in the area of ​​objects we assign an object in this regard 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.709
 these objects can be magic 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.510
 potions and weapons of rank in the area equipment us 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.949
 we choose the costumes 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.139
 swords shields with boots in the map area we see our location and 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.510
 the towns and areas that we discover 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.830
 and in the status or state we see our mission objects the 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:13.580
 songs 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.420
 efe 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.549
 there is another thing here you can not level up but we can level up 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.840
 our life and our magic fulfilling different missions or finding the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.800
 items on the stage 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.009
 I do not know why would that be 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.560
 that I think every new video I make is more lax than the previous one 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.860
 Maybe it's because of the heat it makes here in Argentina xd xd xd must 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.569
 Well now let's see how the battles unfold 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.580
 in them we must think 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.710
 since it is not only to attack we must be agile to block salazar 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.039
 the festival and counterattack the battles with those who have more difficult but 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.199
 they become easier if you know how to educate them 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.479
 during the battles we can change weapons to move magic 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.259
 Feasts fusari 6 and everything to try to defeat them is worth saying that 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.729
 when we defeat an enemy it drops various items 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.909
 although the game follows a plot line, check if we can 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.459
 do optional missions perform the games and all that so that our 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:21.289
 experience in this virtual world be fun the controls are easy the 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.419
 music is good immerses you in it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.449
 the fx sounds are quite realistic and the fun never ends now 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.159
 I do not think there's more to be said about this game so we go to the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.159
 conclusions 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.580
 This game is very good is highly recommended for those who have not played 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.639
 the saga since it is entertaining is one of the best sales there is certainly for 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.199
 those who do not know the protagonist is not called 30x20 the protagonist is called 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:50.810
 link 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.190
 and the princess is called 30 oddly in some games cell does not appear xdxd 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.419
 must in order for this game goes a deserved 9 points 5 because since the 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.550
 nintendo 64 ran out of the final fantasy 7 this game along with others more 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.800
 they make the console good 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.469
 the story is interesting 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.019
 very good music very good graphics and good that's all that 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:19.699
 I have to say right I put a 9 points 5 only because the one that to me 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.569
 more I liked it was the legend of zelda and the mask of improvement that is the game 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.879
 darker and sinister of the saga but that's another matter now left them a 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.379
 minute more with images of this game but retes tourist ado 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.119
 from here Argentina I say goodbye I'm dark medical until next time
