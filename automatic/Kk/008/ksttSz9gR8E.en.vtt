better knives what better steels would
have<00:00:42.000> graphics<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:43.170> detail<00:00:44.420> yeah

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
have graphics with this much detail yeah

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.619 
have graphics with this much detail yeah
there<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> close-up<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.829> well<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:48.510> like

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
there is the close-up I well I was like

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.500 
there is the close-up I well I was like
it<00:00:48.780> says<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.260> Halloween<00:00:49.770> coming<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:51.059> I

guess those are all the the zombies that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
guess those are all the the zombies that
threw<00:00:54.210> through<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> generations<00:00:55.379> have

fallen<00:00:55.800> prey<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:57.180> Karambit<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
fallen prey to a Karambit there is a

fallen prey to a Karambit there is a
close-up<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> blade<00:01:00.570> shape<00:01:00.870> again<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
close-up of the blade shape again the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
close-up of the blade shape again the
monster<00:01:02.280> tip<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.699> far<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.090> how<00:01:03.270> point<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
monster tip as far as how point it is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
monster tip as far as how point it is
very<00:01:04.199> nice<00:01:04.799> blade<00:01:05.129> shape<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.790> could<00:01:06.060> do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
very nice blade shape like I could do

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
very nice blade shape like I could do
without<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.810> combo<00:01:07.439> edge<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> that's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
without the combo edge you know that's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
without the combo edge you know that's
not<00:01:09.030> necessary<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> course<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> actual

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
not necessary and of course the actual

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.030 
not necessary and of course the actual
edge<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.330> fairly<00:01:12.330> dull<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:14.010> about

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
edge is fairly dull but it's all about

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670 
edge is fairly dull but it's all about
the<00:01:14.250> tip<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.630> substantial<00:01:16.049> thumb

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the tip you can see substantial thumb

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.969 
the tip you can see substantial thumb
ramp<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.630> overall<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
ramp on it as well so overall you know a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.749 
ramp on it as well so overall you know a
+4<00:01:20.549> pointedness<00:01:21.830> here's<00:01:22.830> another<00:01:23.159> close-up

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
+4 pointedness here's another close-up

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.450 
+4 pointedness here's another close-up
you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.140> rings<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> double<00:01:26.220> ring

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
give that a D as far as lack of strength

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.219 
give that a D as far as lack of strength
not<00:01:35.189> good

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
not good
