don't use those curl enhancers because

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.629 
don't use those curl enhancers because
what<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.359> do<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.049> use<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.710> bodybuilding

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
all over my hair and then I used a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.460 
all over my hair and then I used a
diffuser<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.390> definitely<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
diffuser so definitely do not put a

diffuser so definitely do not put a
generous<00:01:49.920> amount<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.729> be

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
generous amount because you will be

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
generous amount because you will be
wasting<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.450> money<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:52.829> I

wasting your money just like what I
showed<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:54.000> fine<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
showed you and that will be fine and I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
showed you and that will be fine and I
got<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.829> results<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.549> used<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.939> little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
got good results I used a little bit of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.810 
got good results I used a little bit of
