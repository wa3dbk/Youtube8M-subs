00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
ones only in the sense that you're in a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
okay and that's all right because this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.970 
okay and that's all right because this
is<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> passive<00:00:10.170> wheel<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.530> actually<00:00:10.800> doesn't

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
is a passive wheel it actually doesn't

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
is a passive wheel it actually doesn't
engage<00:00:11.219> or<00:00:12.179> or<00:00:12.389> deal<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.860> turbine<00:00:13.860> at

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
engage or or deal with the turbine at

engage or or deal with the turbine at
all<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.610> little<00:00:15.059> secret<00:00:15.450> though<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> if

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
all a little secret though is is that if

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.710 
all a little secret though is is that if
you<00:00:16.770> chew<00:00:17.039> up<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.550> these<00:00:17.640> wheels<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.570> can

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you chew up one of these wheels you can

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
you chew up one of these wheels you can
actually<00:00:18.869> switch<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> backup

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
actually switch this one out as a backup

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
actually switch this one out as a backup
because<00:00:20.670> again<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.480> open<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:21.960> doesn't

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
because again it's just open and doesn't

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.050 
because again it's just open and doesn't
get<00:00:22.289> chewed<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.590> try<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.580> be

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
get chewed up try not to do that but be

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.970 
get chewed up try not to do that but be
aware<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.750> flip<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.170> place<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
aware they can flip into place and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
aware they can flip into place and
that's<00:00:26.130> why<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.519> has<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.820> teases<00:00:27.119> yeah

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that's why this one has it teases yeah

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
that's why this one has it teases yeah
they<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.109> mole<00:00:28.400> smart<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.910> like

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they just make one mole smart just like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
they just make one mole smart just like
all<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.510> ones<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.960> are<00:00:30.990> replacing<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
all the other ones we are replacing the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.100 
all the other ones we are replacing the
lead<00:00:32.700> available<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:33.719> these<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
lead available but these are the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.350 
lead available but these are the
original<00:00:34.230> parts<00:00:34.770> except<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> brass<00:00:35.969> lock

gonna find in that kid so we're going to
put<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> aside<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.680> started

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
put this aside here and now I started

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.709 
put this aside here and now I started
pre-install<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> notice

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pre-install here you're going to notice

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.190 
pre-install here you're going to notice
under<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:49.020> little

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
under here there is the there are little

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
under here there is the there are little
guides<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:50.100> stop<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:50.760> spinning

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
guides to stop this thing from spinning

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
guides to stop this thing from spinning
so<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> try<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> gently<00:00:52.620> set<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so I'm going to try to gently set it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
so I'm going to try to gently set it
roughly<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.940> place<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.199> been

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
roughly in place here now it has been

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.610 
roughly in place here now it has been

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and we're going to actually take one of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
and we're going to actually take one of
these<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.690> easier

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
these out to make it just a bit easier

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
these out to make it just a bit easier

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
on the install process I'm going to try

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.730 
on the install process I'm going to try
to<00:01:06.689> set<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.260> through<00:01:07.920> oh<00:01:09.260> boy<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.619> go

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.789 
set this through the hole all right now
this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> quite<00:01:16.759> wrong<00:01:17.759> hole<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.619> like<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
