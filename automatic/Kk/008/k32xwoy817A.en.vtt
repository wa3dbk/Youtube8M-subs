00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.970
 My body challenges me 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.759
 [Music] 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.130
 These two girls are Tatiana and Anastasia 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.260
 dogar 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.410

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.480
 chicago in the usa are happy girls e 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.550
 smart what is very unusual 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.280
 considering that they were born together by the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.039
 head 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.189

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.500
 the twins were born in rome italy but 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.110
 their parents brought them to the USA to see 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.290
 to specialists in united twins 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 had just been born it was the first time 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 you saw us 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:47.949
 I was very sick look at my face and its 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.410
 mother and claudia is nurse she knew 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.480
 I expected twins but only found out 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.120
 that they were united when I had almost 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.130
 five months of pregnancy was a day that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 I'll never forget 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:05.090
 almost collapsed I was afraid of what 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.070
 I would come, I was very scared, very scared 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.830
 probably a single pair of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 twins craniopagus in the world per year 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.940
 almost all the twins together like that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.890
 survive the birth is still unknown by 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 what the united twins merge like this 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.240
 in the uterus but for some reason when 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.450
 the embryo begins to separate in 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.969
 Twins can not completely divide 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.759
 Anastasia and Tatiana were born by caesarean 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.490
 successfully and they came into the world 13 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.460
 January 2004 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 they were so small and fragile 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.369
 but I saw them as two girls were my 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.100
 girls their life expectancy was at 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.830
 start 24 hours let me help you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 anastasia look at the now they almost have 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.549
 8 years we go 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.649
 children change their parents' lives 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.630
 but with me it was double for claudia and 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.399
 her husband by taking his family to 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.580
 America meant starting a new 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.580
 lifetime 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.690
 they were determined that their twins 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.620
 will lead a normal and happy childhood 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.620
 [Music] 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.390
 when people observe is because they do not 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.420
 they know how people react 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.120
 they stop and ask and it's okay because 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.110
 it's not something you see every day 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.850
 then it's normal to be curious 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.500
 Anastasia and Tatiana do not get discouraged with 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.960
 all that attention they love the water are 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.540
 very adventurous girls if you tell them that 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.820
 they can not do something they will try it 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.590
 achieve it both have problems 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.810
 doctors Tatiana's legs are 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.910
 develop a little bit so use a harness 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.770
 the anastasia kidneys do not work 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.410
 but tatiana's work for both 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.980
 and they also have bad vision to see them 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.170
 grow 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.920
 see them do things we never think 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.569
 possible 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.650
 [Music] 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.350
 just watch them live 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.750
 it's a miracle that happens every day 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.000
 Anastasio does almost everything but tatiana 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.030
 you need to coordinate with her and help her 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.120
 teamwork 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 [Music] 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.840
 it was very entertaining 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.970
 when the twins were three years old 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.620
 they underwent an operation to 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.049
 start the separation process 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.090
 unfortunately during the 10 hours of 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.190
 surgery blood pressure 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.319
 girls was destabilized their brains 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.879
 they began to swell dangerously 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.930
 so they had to postpone the operation 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.930
 in the end it was impossible to separate them 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.930
 successfully 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.880
 I was very disappointed 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:10.380
 I had to conform and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.750
 saying this is not the end of the world 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.710
 [Music] 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 It was a moment that changed my life 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.440
 tatiana let's do enough 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.870
 however since the great stumbling the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.570
 things have not changed much for this 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.820
 unusual family with strength anastasia 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.820
 well it 's very good 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.089
 this Christmas is the only life that 

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:41.559
 they know is difficult especially 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:44.319
 when they are two people with different 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:47.549
 personalities because sometimes they want 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.549
 do different things 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000
 whatever the future of anastasia and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.650
 tatiana one thing and sure these 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.110
 Lovely girls will continue to strive 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.170
 to overcome whatever life 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.149
 put ahead
