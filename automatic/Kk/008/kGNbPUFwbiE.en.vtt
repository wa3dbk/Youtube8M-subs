00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.480
 of malta 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 Oh 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.530
 the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.710
 it was hell 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 mr 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.340
 May 12th if I'm doing this today 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.860
 video is just for you 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.920
 talk about a phenomenon that is growing 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.460
 more and more in France it's the parent 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 football 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 run barefoot or the minima the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.680
 rescue with shoes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.740
 minimalist 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 for my part I have never tried one of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.759
 those of methane never ran a feet 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.399
 bare or with minimalist shoes 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.190
 wanted to have a little bit of your opinion 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.580
 on these two methods 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 if you've already crossed the road to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.729
 so go from shoes to become 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.700
 normal to minimalist shoes or 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 even if you practice by football 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.270
 running barefoot she wished for 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.250
 you the advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.190
 of these two methods I discussed 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 also with different a little lag 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.069
 is also I chronicled the book of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.770
 frédéric brossard by foot is 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.399
 minimalist covered mutual with each 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.259
 times the different specialists 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.979
 advocate a transition year 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.459
 will not go completely 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.560
 running sneakers with cushioning or in 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.290
 course with the attak paul dalon a race 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.640
 where we run with the technique with the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.890
 foot but duke is so clearly 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.850
 relearn to run on change 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.040
 completely his way of running so 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.100
 the idea is in the beginning so to run 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.420
 a few minutes and then slab housed at 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.400
 the different minutes each of his 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.019
 short 5 minute workouts with 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.740
 minimalist shoes the first time 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.380
 a recovery jog 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.680
 the second time sorry so minutes and 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.530
 so on etc. 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.190
 leave me a little bit your experience by 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.420
 report to this theme 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.100
 so you enjoyed so trying to 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 run with minimalist shoes 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.330
 do you have any injuries what 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.570
 you are frustrated because re 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.000
 learn to run and to a year of 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.830
 transition that can you and shine me 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.740
 I think running barefoot so 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.160
 minimalist it is in my opinion a good 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.680
 thing 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.480
 the big negative point is 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.700
 relearn to run when we had 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.150
 used to run for years 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.260
 to years with running sneakers 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.660
 classic makes obvious me it is not 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.810
 too motivated we relearn to hatch 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 and that means it takes a year to 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.770
 transition to completely pass 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.280
 a method 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.790
 to us from your lived this very interesting 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.910
