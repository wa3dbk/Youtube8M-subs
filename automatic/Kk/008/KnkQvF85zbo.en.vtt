find going for my labs I think mobs and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
find going for my labs I think mobs and
general<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.360> aren't<00:00:54.600> very<00:00:54.770> they're<00:00:55.770> not

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
general just aren't very they're not

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
general just aren't very they're not
useful<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.149> 25<00:00:57.539> gunstreak<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
useful going for that 25 gunstreak is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.010 
useful going for that 25 gunstreak is
not<00:00:58.350> useful<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.820> not<00:00:59.940> entertaining<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
not useful and it's not entertaining a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.399 
not useful and it's not entertaining a
lot<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> mobs<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:02.250> seen<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.049> not<00:01:04.049> because

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
lot of mobs I've seen it's not because

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
lot of mobs I've seen it's not because
the<00:01:04.559> person<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.070> playing<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:05.939> good<00:01:06.090> if

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the person is playing really good if

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
the person is playing really good if
really<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:06.840> besides<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> mark<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> J<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.520> uh

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
really well besides the mark of J but uh

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.100 
really well besides the mark of J but uh
but<00:01:09.030> mostly<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.689> person's<00:01:09.990> plays

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but mostly because the person's plays

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.770 
but mostly because the person's plays
really<00:01:10.290> passive<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> can't<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.340> or

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
really passive and can't be or

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.969 
really passive and can't be or
protecting<00:01:12.780> their<00:01:12.960> spawn<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.500> protecting<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
protecting their spawn or protecting a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.820 
protecting their spawn or protecting a
certain<00:01:14.130> point<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.619> it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
certain point in it so I just think it's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
certain point in it so I just think it's
really<00:01:16.939> really<00:01:17.939> odd<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really really odd because a lot of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.490 
really really odd because a lot of
people<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:21.090> bow<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.600> bow

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.080 
actually today I just want to talk about
the<00:01:44.790> mo<00:01:45.000> lab<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:46.079> thoughts<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
the mo lab and my thoughts about it and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
the mo lab and my thoughts about it and
and<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.509> many<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.799> probably

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and as many of you know you probably

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
and as many of you know you probably
should<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> lab<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> 25

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
should know then the lab is a 25

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.550 
should know then the lab is a 25

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gunstreak kill streak that is a hidden

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
gunstreak kill streak that is a hidden
in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> game<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.369> no<00:01:56.430> challenges<00:01:56.909> for

in the game there's no challenges for

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.420 
in the game there's no challenges for
there's<00:01:57.479> no<00:01:57.630> there's<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.320> no<00:01:58.680> record<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
there's no there's really no record of

there's no there's really no record of
you<00:01:59.640> having<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> once<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> once<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you having it once you get it once you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130 
you having it once you get it once you
called<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.610> goes<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.360> are

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
called in it just goes in and then are

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.859 
called in it just goes in and then are
you<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:05.070> drops<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you it drops down and you don't get to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
you it drops down and you don't get to
see<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.740> combat<00:02:08.009> record

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
see it it's not on your combat record

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
see it it's not on your combat record
it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> challenge<00:02:09.000> snot<00:02:09.179> anywhere<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it's not a challenge snot anywhere and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960 
it's not a challenge snot anywhere and
so<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.770> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> hidden<00:02:11.459> easter<00:02:11.700> egg

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so it's kind of like a hidden easter egg

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.350 
so it's kind of like a hidden easter egg
type<00:02:12.209> deal

you can get a MOAB with less than 25

get it with 24 kills and if you have

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.700 
get it with 24 kills and if you have
hardline<00:02:21.280> pro<00:02:21.460> on<00:02:21.730> Trevor<00:02:22.570> or<00:02:22.870> Tmart<00:02:23.290> got<00:02:23.500> one

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
hardline pro on Trevor or Tmart got one

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.860 
hardline pro on Trevor or Tmart got one
with<00:02:23.890> 22<00:02:24.340> kills<00:02:24.610> I've<00:02:24.850> gotten<00:02:25.120> one<00:02:25.300> with<00:02:25.480> 21

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
with 22 kills I've gotten one with 21

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.800 
with 22 kills I've gotten one with 21
kills<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:27.160> think<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.970> handful<00:02:28.540> people<00:02:28.570> have

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
kills I think a handful people have

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.840 
kills I think a handful people have
gotten<00:02:28.960> number<00:02:29.110> 23<00:02:29.590> kills<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.100> there's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
gotten number 23 kills and so there's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.330 
gotten number 23 kills and so there's
just<00:02:31.060> some<00:02:31.270> weird<00:02:31.750> glitch<00:02:32.260> where<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
just some weird glitch where the the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.660 
just some weird glitch where the the
Moab's<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.110> cysts<00:02:38.560> count<00:02:38.830> towards<00:02:39.250> kills

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
Moab's the the cysts count towards kills

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.510 
Moab's the the cysts count towards kills
but<00:02:40.330> since<00:02:40.660> you're<00:02:41.200> not<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.980> towards<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
but since you're not going towards a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.290 
but since you're not going towards a
killstreak<00:02:42.990> per<00:02:43.990> se<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.910> don't<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.209> don't

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
killstreak per se I don't know I don't

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.610 
killstreak per se I don't know I don't
know<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.540> don't<00:02:46.720> think<00:02:46.959> they<00:02:47.020> tested<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.470> out

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
know I don't think they tested it out

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.199 
know I don't think they tested it out
they<00:02:47.890> didn't<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.280> don't<00:02:48.580> think<00:02:48.730> they<00:02:48.820> knew<00:02:49.000> that

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
they didn't I don't think they knew that

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.390 
they didn't I don't think they knew that
that<00:02:49.390> would<00:02:49.510> happen<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.020> yes<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.190> get<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
that would happen but yes you can get a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.000 
that would happen but yes you can get a
MOAB<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.970> less<00:02:52.180> than<00:02:52.209> 25<00:02:52.930> kills<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.560> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
MOAB with less than 25 kills it is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.420 
MOAB with less than 25 kills it is
