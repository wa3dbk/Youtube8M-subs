sometimes of us here's a stir and I
don't<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.579> hackerspace<00:02:54.060> night

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
don't know I like this hackerspace night

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.860 
don't know I like this hackerspace night
it<00:02:57.239> was<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:58.730> here<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.849> are<00:02:59.940> Tokyo<00:03:00.360> hackerspace

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it was up here we are Tokyo hackerspace

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.440 
it was up here we are Tokyo hackerspace
is<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> safe<00:03:01.379> cast<00:03:01.650> car<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:05.450> that

all just one big happy family we're

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.390 
all just one big happy family we're
building<00:03:29.790> mobile<00:03:30.329> sensors<00:03:31.190> what<00:03:32.190> kind<00:03:32.340> of

excellent<00:03:35.639> primarily<00:03:36.090> we're<00:03:36.269> trying<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.569> find

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
excellent primarily we're trying to find

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.280 
excellent primarily we're trying to find
it<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> novel<00:03:37.680> way<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:38.000> decrease<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> cost<00:03:39.510> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
it a novel way to decrease the cost to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.229 
it a novel way to decrease the cost to
make<00:03:40.620> reasonable<00:03:40.980> food<00:03:41.250> measurements<00:03:41.760> for

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
make reasonable food measurements for

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.210 
make reasonable food measurements for
you<00:03:42.569> know<00:03:42.660> radiation<00:03:43.230> contamination<00:03:43.919> in

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
you know radiation contamination in

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.970 
you know radiation contamination in
common<00:03:45.000> substance<00:03:45.359> especially<00:03:45.660> food<00:03:45.980> but

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
common substance especially food but

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.099 
common substance especially food but
it's<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.760> valuable<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.359> we<00:03:48.569> have<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.840> try<00:03:49.049> and

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
it's so valuable that we have to try and

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.830 
it's so valuable that we have to try and
do<00:03:49.889> something<00:03:50.040> that's<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:51.419> can<00:03:51.599> lisa

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
do something that's that we can lisa

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.740 
do something that's that we can lisa
short<00:03:52.049> people<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.560> it's<00:03:52.799> below<00:03:53.310> some

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
short people that it's below some

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.930 
short people that it's below some
obviously<00:03:54.750> dangerous<00:03:54.930> level<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
obviously dangerous level so this is a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.690 
obviously dangerous level so this is a
lint<00:03:57.750> shielded<00:03:58.200> dead<00:03:59.040> children<00:03:59.250> enclosure

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
lint shielded dead children enclosure

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.699 
lint shielded dead children enclosure
for<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.060> food<00:04:00.209> measurement<00:04:00.660> right<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.530> these

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
for the food measurement right so these

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.159 
for the food measurement right so these
bricks<00:04:02.069> are<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:03.000> low<00:04:03.359> will<00:04:03.480> be<00:04:03.540> sitting<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
bricks are like low will be sitting on a

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.110 
bricks are like low will be sitting on a
bit<00:04:04.430> like<00:04:05.430> top<00:04:06.239> 20<00:04:06.980> 30<00:04:07.980> kilograms<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.760> peace<00:04:08.970> or

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
bit like top 20 30 kilograms of peace or

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.020 
bit like top 20 30 kilograms of peace or
don't<00:04:09.299> think<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:10.109> got<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.319> 50<00:04:10.859> kilograms<00:04:11.549> ingot

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
don't think we got a 50 kilograms ingot

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.229 
don't think we got a 50 kilograms ingot
of<00:04:12.150> lead<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.829> cut<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.190> into<00:04:14.370> smaller<00:04:14.669> pieces<00:04:14.910> to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.770 
of lead to cut it into smaller pieces to
melted<00:04:15.680> okay<00:04:16.680> very<00:04:16.979> very<00:04:17.489> nice<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.599> was<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
melted okay very very nice so that was a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.970 
melted okay very very nice so that was a
bit<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.079> a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
bit of a

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.230 
bit of a

lems to try and break in a piece of

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.430 
lems to try and break in a piece of
small<00:04:21.600> enough<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.810> we<00:04:21.930> could<00:04:22.020> actually<00:04:22.080> put

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
small enough that we could actually put

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.680 
small enough that we could actually put
in<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.590> pot<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:22.830> melt<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.490> cast<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.360> into<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
shape to go around the sensors that's

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.550 
shape to go around the sensors that's
why<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.310> guys<00:04:26.460> were<00:04:26.610> hacking<00:04:27.380> literally<00:04:28.380> an

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
why you guys were hacking literally an

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.100 
why you guys were hacking literally an
axe<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.090> these<00:04:30.090> acts<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.570> actually<00:04:30.840> used

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
axe I these acts that we actually used

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.900 
axe I these acts that we actually used
the<00:04:32.090> couple's<00:04:33.090> hatchet<00:04:33.540> oh<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:34.230> can<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> hammer

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
the couple's hatchet oh I can a hammer

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.980 
the couple's hatchet oh I can a hammer
just<00:04:35.910> driving<00:04:36.270> through<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> lead<00:04:36.600> breaking

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
just driving through the lead breaking

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.470 
just driving through the lead breaking
into<00:04:37.140> pieces<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.560> were<00:04:37.650> about<00:04:38.060> 15<00:04:39.060> kilograms

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
into pieces that were about 15 kilograms

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.970 
into pieces that were about 15 kilograms
of<00:04:39.570> peace<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.020> then<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.380> then<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.620> can<00:04:40.770> smelt

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
of peace and then and then you can smelt
