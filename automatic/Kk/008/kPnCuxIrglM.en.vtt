gatefold German import I was stoked to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.599 
gatefold German import I was stoked to
find<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> didn't<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.369> went

home to go play it and I discovered the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.070 
home to go play it and I discovered the
sad<00:00:20.340> truth<00:00:21.619> it's<00:00:22.619> probably<00:00:23.340> better<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
sad truth it's probably better as a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.210 
sad truth it's probably better as a
skateboard<00:00:25.080> ramp<00:00:25.170> than<00:00:25.619> anything<00:00:25.859> else

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
skateboard ramp than anything else

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because this thing is warped in several

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.679 
because this thing is warped in several
places<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.490> record<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.330> both

technique<00:00:33.149> where<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.420> put<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.899> record

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
technique where you put the record
