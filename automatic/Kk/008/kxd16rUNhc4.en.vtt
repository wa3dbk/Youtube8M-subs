00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.680
 these forests are their last refuge 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.400
 amazon pool takes up considerable 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 part of the north region of south america 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 the area is over half the size 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.990
 Australia is the green heart of big 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.540
 continent 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:40.190
 its forests may be considered lungs of the planet 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.190
 but now the forest is changing 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 and it pose a threat to wild 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.270
 natures amazon 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.270
 adapting and many millions of years 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.980
 the largest and predator sushi jaguar for 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.790
 successful life requires 300 square 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.790
 kilometers of forest 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.800
 scientists want to better study the population 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.820
 jaguars and find out how things are 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.220
 if they manage to establish that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 happens to the top predator they succeed 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.650
 penetrate the essence complex and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.750
 interconnected and the web of forest life 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.260
 if jaguar and flourish means prey 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 a lot that means habitat 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.369
 great but first scientists must catch 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
 jaguar they believe that in the area 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.950
 jungle they are still found but four 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 years only three individuals were caught 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.760
 either jaguar and too careful not 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.330
 either their number is dangerously reduced 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.369
 setting traps 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.369
 scientists are waiting and hoping 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.350
 even in the rainforest is preserved 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.600
 the change of seasons in December are going 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:10.250
 storm clouds foreshadowing beginnings 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.590
 heavy rains for one group of birds this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.130
 last chance to attract the attention of the female 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 until the rains stop mating 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.590
 glittering male feathers red anti other 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.590
 Cyprus and 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.990
 and a whole year 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.990
 i'm so could stop and look 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.910
 about himself must decide who the most vivid 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.890
 feathers and graceful movements only the most 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.720
 beautiful bright will get a chance to breed 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.980
 for the young bella mountain bearded 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.870
 manokin color is less important than dance and he 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 monitors the place of his performance even 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.510
 an extra sheet might be worth his attention 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.099
 he quickly gets rid of it 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.099
 chic 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.040
 but he still failed to produce 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.040
 impression on the female 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.720
 he may not have such a chance 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.720
 this season is not enough time 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.300
 end of December, the rainy season came down in 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.300
 full strength 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.390
 in some areas the level of loss 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.140
 precipitation is three meters per 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.140
 several months 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.849
 animals that live here should 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.849
 adapt or perish 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.880
 melting snow sand and rain from tropical 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.110
 forests bring down over 200 billion 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.110
 tons of water to the valleys 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.420
 even the amazon river the largest 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 the planet's freshwater reservoir cannot 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.890
 hold so much water every year she 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.630
 overflowing 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.630
 increasing 5 times 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.680
 it floods the area around 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.680
 equal area
