00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:13.010
 3rd assembly of the machine 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.490
 we will start with our 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.490
 back 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 and here you are watching 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.810
 we will use a little trick that is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.200
 give a slight bend in our race 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 flex in the middle of the art with your finger 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.329
 causing a slight curvature of people 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 It can not be anything too exaggerated is 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.989
 just so that the tips of our 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 needle stay rent with our toe 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 This will give us more precision in our 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:01:02.700
 checking trace is in the center 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:05.759
 of the nozzle in the middle once it is placed in the tube 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 in the toe we will put in our 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:15.710
 machine carefully so as not to knock 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.689
 should be tight they should not be 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.689
 purple 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:40.819
 once more the free passage to 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.819
 continue tube inlet 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.189
 only one millimeter that should be 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 out with our machine is in 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.490
 operation 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.409
 then put the elastic 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.280
 remembering where he can not 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:25.900
 put great pressure on art 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:27.760
 because you can let out you can jump 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.610
 the end of the batsman during the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.700
 process of tattooing then checking the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.650
 fashion pressure less than distance 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.940
 between the upper ball and the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:49.829
 elastic contact always in the middle of our 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:03:00.640
 it should not be superimposed or 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:03:02.980
 your machine will be a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.299
 simple and easy task but we can not 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.299
 ignore some details that may cause 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.959
 problems for us during the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.310
 tattoo or compromise the operation 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.310
 from our machine 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.079
 now with the machine running 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.790
 we put our fingers at the end of the 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.579
 batsman 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 feeling if she's beating softly 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:51.370
 the constant beat so we will pass 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.370
 for our painting machine 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.299
 reminding you that your needles should be 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.299
 always face down again 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:20.000
 the needle down 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:27.280
 as you can see in the passing rhythm 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.280
 free checking 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:05:02.939
 carefully place in the machine and 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:02.939
 start groove centering well 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.340
 and now we will install it in operation 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.420
 place your finger on the tip of your 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.430
 batsman 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.830
 check how much of your needle is 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:57.820
 getting out of strip as you can see 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:00.280
 in the video hit but it was even when you 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.610
 pull the batter back 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.890
 it must continue to operate at 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:11.520
 machine should not lock it will do its 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:24.070
 The beat then gave a final adjustment 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:27.480
 rosenthal ball perfect conditions for 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.480
 get a good job 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.890
 O
