00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.309
 hi always cristina da suona pianoforte 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.710
 dot com 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.730
 in this video I want to show you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.860
 which are the harmonic turns of the blues and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.160
 how can you put them into practice? 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.420
 in case you like it if this specific 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 topic well here we have an example of 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 you can see four lines that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 they are divided here by the temples and they are 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.720
 numbered 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 we have the right hand and the hand 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.070
 I left as I showed you in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 a previous video 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 below we have only notes to which 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 what agreements correspond to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.540
 I wanted to explain you well is for example that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 what does this 9 mean because it is 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.360
 very important as both blues and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.309
 rock to jazz use chords 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.530
 which are no longer just agreements 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.619
 fundamentals type do mi sol 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 but they add inside theirs 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.710
 harmony add other notes as per 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710
 example 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.050
 here is a typical ninth agreement 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.460
 blues well we see exercise 1 and you it 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.000
 I show directly on the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.570
 keyboard 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.570
 then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.280
 then agreement re m minor has no ti 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.250
 I remember that we are always in the shade 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.790
 of C major is the second degree 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.270
 compared ad hoc and 9 because why re ago 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 there 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.660
 c then 357 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.160
 this is a grandmother because she comes up 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.160
 at the ninth interval 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 then soul ninth 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.690
 and i have 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.439
 what you are seeing now is that who 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.950
 will sound soon called cadences that 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:21.730
 what the cadences are practically 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.790
 a succession of short agreements ie 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.200
 short in the sense of few agreements that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.290
 conclude 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.319
 let's take a second fifth first example 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.209
 it's the classic cadence of blues but also 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.129
 of jazz 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.500
 see second second first again 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.140
 second fifth first second fifth 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.840
 first the one that changes 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.459
 as you can see from exercise 1 to 2 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.810
 at 3 to 4 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.950
 are the chords of the right hand 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.700
 then from our left that is from 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.950
 left we do hours 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.950
 and build upon the ninth agreement 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.950
 ok 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.530
 I put all these agreements in you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.600
 attached in pdf so now you get them 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.590
 I'll show you then you can put them in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.590
 practice yourself 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.290
 exercise between 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.460
 exercise 4
