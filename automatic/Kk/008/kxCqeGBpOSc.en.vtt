long time rival of ours and how did that
go<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.869> felt<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.409> mean<00:01:46.619> period

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
go I felt like I really mean period

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.719

beating<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> child<00:01:49.340> though<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> game<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
beating a child though the game is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.899 
beating a child though the game is
really<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.689> sided<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.500> honestly<00:01:53.310> expected<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really one sided I honestly expected the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
really one sided I honestly expected the
game<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.210> harder<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.049> thought<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
game to be harder like we thought that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.959 
game to be harder like we thought that
game<00:01:56.070> would<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.250> harder<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> one

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
game would be harder than the one

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.490 
game would be harder than the one
playing<00:01:57.210> against<00:01:59.119> which<00:02:00.119> Colin<00:02:00.509> Martin<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.960> lot

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
playing against which Colin Martin a lot

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.420 
playing against which Colin Martin a lot
of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> reason<00:02:01.799> why<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.040> thought<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.340> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
of the reason why I thought would be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
of the reason why I thought would be
harder<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.090> screamed<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.659> seals

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
harder is because we screamed like seals

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.630 
harder is because we screamed like seals
you<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> lot<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:04.920> should<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you a lot so they should know a lot of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.419 
you a lot so they should know a lot of
how<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.509> play<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.200> our<00:02:07.680> play<00:02:07.950> style<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
how we play and like our play style is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.080 
how we play and like our play style is
level<00:02:08.759> one

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
level one

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.249 
level one
they<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.269> lot<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> replays<00:02:09.840> been<00:02:10.019> going

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
they have a lot of replays been going

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
they have a lot of replays been going
through<00:02:10.379> stuff<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.550> what

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
through stuff like that this is what

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
through stuff like that this is what
happens<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:12.030> made<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.750> bad<00:02:12.989> mistake

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
happens they made one really bad mistake

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720 
happens they made one really bad mistake
bottom<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.040> another<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.519> bad

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
bottom and like another really bad

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.059 
bottom and like another really bad
mistake<00:02:14.910> that's<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.650> through<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
mistake that's that like through the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.059 
mistake that's that like through the
whole<00:02:17.340> game<00:02:17.370> away<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.680> did<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.890> think

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
whole game away so what did you think

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.970 
whole game away so what did you think
the<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:21.060> pre-match<00:02:21.450> video<00:02:21.930> obviously<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.920> we

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the the pre-match video obviously as we

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880 
the the pre-match video obviously as we
know<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.819> video<00:02:24.060> shot<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.989> week<00:02:25.530> two

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
know like the video shot like a week two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.460 
know like the video shot like a week two
weeks<00:02:25.920> before<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.610> actual<00:02:26.760> matches<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.569> hot

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
weeks before the actual matches so hot

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.229 
weeks before the actual matches so hot
shot<00:02:28.680> quarters<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> bit<00:02:29.220> one-dimensional<00:02:29.430> he's

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
shot quarters a bit one-dimensional he's

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.820 
shot quarters a bit one-dimensional he's
a<00:02:30.269> friend<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> us<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.049> we<00:02:31.110> won't<00:02:31.230> slay<00:02:31.500> him<00:02:31.650> too

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
a friend of us and we won't slay him too

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.619 
a friend of us and we won't slay him too
badly<00:02:32.069> but<00:02:32.459> did<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.849> spur<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.299> wanna<00:02:33.450> talk

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
badly but did that spur you wanna talk

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.530 
badly but did that spur you wanna talk
oh<00:02:34.580> they<00:02:35.580> didn't<00:02:35.819> already<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.330> Ella

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
oh they didn't already think of Ella

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.589 
oh they didn't already think of Ella
yeah<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.379> mean<00:02:37.549> Odyssey<00:02:38.549> right<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.330> pins

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
yeah I mean Odyssey right kind of pins

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.380 
yeah I mean Odyssey right kind of pins
you<00:02:39.840> into<00:02:40.080> walls<00:02:40.319> sometimes<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:42.239> know

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you into walls sometimes and you know

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.960 
you into walls sometimes and you know
you<00:02:42.599> just<00:02:42.750> cut<00:02:43.019> out<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.260> say<00:02:43.410> stuff<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.880> you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
you just cut out to say stuff but you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.339 
you just cut out to say stuff but you
could<00:02:45.120> say<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.239> with<00:02:45.450> any<00:02:45.569> team<00:02:45.840> honestly

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
could say that with any team honestly

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.130 
could say that with any team honestly
lasing<00:02:47.130> na<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.690> don't<00:02:48.840> think<00:02:48.959> everybody

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
lasing na like I don't think everybody

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.770 
lasing na like I don't think everybody
really<00:02:49.530> does<00:02:49.650> weird<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.760> learn<00:02:51.150> we

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
really does weird like you learn we

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.920 
really does weird like you learn we
know<00:02:52.079> we<00:02:52.349> know<00:02:52.380> heroes<00:02:52.829> Barton<00:02:53.130> plays

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
know we know heroes Barton plays

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.330 
know we know heroes Barton plays
complexity<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.049> GD<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.799> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.129> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
complexity a GD you like if you just I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.009 
complexity a GD you like if you just I
guess<00:02:56.549> jejeje<00:02:57.060> sometimes<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
guess jejeje sometimes it's like the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.259 
guess jejeje sometimes it's like the
most<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:58.950> unbeatable<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.030> had<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
most kind of unbeatable if you had to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.030 
most kind of unbeatable if you had to
say<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.900> wanna<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.230> everything<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.799> pretty

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
say but I wanna see everything is pretty

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.869 
say but I wanna see everything is pretty
has<00:03:02.489> her<00:03:02.700> own<00:03:02.730> kind<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.150> style<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.890> tomorrow

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
has her own kind of style so tomorrow

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.420 
has her own kind of style so tomorrow
gonna<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> break<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.079> then<00:03:07.530> tomorrow<00:03:08.129> we

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
gonna have a break and then tomorrow we

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.059 
gonna have a break and then tomorrow we
got<00:03:08.549> complexity<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.569> we'll<00:03:10.560> come<00:03:10.739> back<00:03:10.950> with

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
got complexity so we'll come back with

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.530 
got complexity so we'll come back with
that<00:03:11.099> but<00:03:11.430> how<00:03:11.849> do<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:11.970> feel<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> about<00:03:12.390> that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
that but how do you feel it about that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240 
that but how do you feel it about that
game<00:03:12.690> after<00:03:13.079> obviously<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> they<00:03:13.829> beat<00:03:13.980> us<00:03:14.069> in

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
game after obviously the they beat us in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.809 
game after obviously the they beat us in
Dallas<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.959> feel<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:17.010> dallas<00:03:17.370> game<00:03:17.459> was

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
Dallas I feel like the dallas game was

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.000 
Dallas I feel like the dallas game was
just<00:03:18.209> our<00:03:18.630> fall<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.290> want<00:03:19.530> every<00:03:19.829> single

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
just our fall and we want every single

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.640 
just our fall and we want every single
lane<00:03:20.310> by<00:03:20.579> ourselves<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.650> threw

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
lane by ourselves and then we threw

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.949 
lane by ourselves and then we threw
bottom<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.880> through<00:03:24.060> top<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.450> lost<00:03:24.720> again

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
bottom but in through top we lost again

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.170 
bottom but in through top we lost again
point<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:25.500> not<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> team<00:03:26.760> public<00:03:27.120> you

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
point it was just not a team public you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.849 
point it was just not a team public you
do<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.510> against<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.109> we<00:03:28.290> did<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.769> was

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
do that against and we did it was

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.890 
do that against and we did it was
horrible<00:03:29.190> i<00:03:29.519> think<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> bastard

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
horrible i think in like a bastard

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.569 
horrible i think in like a bastard
reformat<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:31.980> instance<00:03:32.040> i<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.489> with

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
reformat like for instance i think with

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.360 
reformat like for instance i think with
we<00:03:32.940> would<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.180> came<00:03:33.630> back<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.370> at

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
we would have came back with like at

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.339 
we would have came back with like at
least<00:03:35.519> another<00:03:35.790> way<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.630> but

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
least another way if not to but

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.559 
least another way if not to but
obviously<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.609> best<00:03:38.760> one<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.000> my<00:03:39.239> anything

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
obviously the best one for my anything

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.199 
obviously the best one for my anything
happens<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.230> we're<00:03:40.380> hoping<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.790> time<00:03:42.060> would

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
happens so we're hoping this time would

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.680 
happens so we're hoping this time would
be<00:03:42.269> much<00:03:43.040> much<00:03:46.010> like<00:03:47.010> not<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.549> close<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.120> guess<00:03:48.389> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
be much much like not as close I guess I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.659
