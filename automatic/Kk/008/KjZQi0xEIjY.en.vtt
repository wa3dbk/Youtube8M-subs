first impressions I love the way the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300 
first impressions I love the way the
plot<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.750> set<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> actual<00:01:34.740> place<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
plot was set up in the actual place and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
plot was set up in the actual place and
the<00:01:35.400> atmosphere<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.180> taking<00:01:36.600> place<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the atmosphere this is taking place I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
the atmosphere this is taking place I
mean<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.409> taking<00:01:37.710> place<00:01:37.890> after<00:01:38.070> world<00:01:38.400> war<00:01:38.460> 3

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
mean it's taking place after world war 3

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
mean it's taking place after world war 3
so<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:40.619> form<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so it's actually some form of a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
so it's actually some form of a
futuristic<00:01:41.820> type<00:01:41.970> anime<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> same

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
futuristic type anime but at the same

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
futuristic type anime but at the same
time<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.380> no<00:01:43.500> mechs<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.950> anything<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
episode so what we can see from his

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.510 
episode so what we can see from his
character<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.680> he's<00:02:52.890> very<00:02:52.980> strong

he's very intelligent he's just a very
smart<00:02:56.730> character<00:02:57.210> that's<00:02:57.330> what<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.660> could<00:02:57.780> see

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
smart character that's what we could see

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.230

ones but the sister that his sister is
pretty<00:03:16.830> much<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.100> balloon<00:03:17.310> section<00:03:17.730> but

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
pretty much in the balloon section but

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
pretty much in the balloon section but

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
better group of sites her so most likely

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.330 
better group of sites her so most likely
