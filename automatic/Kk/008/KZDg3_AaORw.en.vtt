what<00:01:02.630> we<00:01:02.780> really<00:01:03.080> do<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.380> create<00:01:03.650> problem

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
what we really do is we create problem

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
to see what this process does they then

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.229 
to see what this process does they then
actually<00:02:43.040> go<00:02:43.129> into<00:02:43.400> depth<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.909> stuff<00:02:44.120> that

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
actually go into depth and stuff that

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.729 
actually go into depth and stuff that
you<00:02:44.330> can't<00:02:44.540> actually<00:02:44.690> find<00:02:45.049> on<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.230> book<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.620> mean

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
you can't actually find on a book I mean

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.680 
you can't actually find on a book I mean
it<00:02:45.890> these<00:02:46.400> teachers<00:02:46.760> actually<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.269> hands-on

behind<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.280> think<00:03:02.239> when<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.569> took<00:03:02.629> my<00:03:02.780> first

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
behind you I think when I took my first

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.479 
behind you I think when I took my first
dynamics<00:03:03.530> class<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:03.950> learned<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.370> you

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
dynamics class and I learned that you

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.610 
dynamics class and I learned that you
know<00:03:04.610> exactly<00:03:05.360> how<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.720> design<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.170> bicycle

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
know exactly how to design a bicycle

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.890 
know exactly how to design a bicycle
properly<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.400> exactly<00:03:07.700> what<00:03:07.909> power<00:03:08.150> was<00:03:08.599> and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
properly and exactly what power was and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.420 
properly and exactly what power was and
it<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.440> got<00:03:09.560> started<00:03:09.859> getting<00:03:10.040> interesting
