00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.210 
is basically the blue bear now the thing
about<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.270> guy<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.840> he<00:02:19.380> likes<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> slide

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
about this guy is that he likes to slide

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.440 
about this guy is that he likes to slide
around<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.300> ice<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:22.620> kind<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> obnoxious

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
around on the ice it's kind of obnoxious

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.940 
around on the ice it's kind of obnoxious
because<00:02:24.450> he's<00:02:24.600> always<00:02:24.750> zipping<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.650> over<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
because he's always zipping all over the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.330 
because he's always zipping all over the
place

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
place

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.700 
place
sliding<00:02:26.700> around<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> his<00:02:28.410> attacks

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
sliding around and a lot of his attacks

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.030 
sliding around and a lot of his attacks
are<00:02:28.860> even<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> too<00:02:29.610> as<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:31.040> he

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
are even like that too as you can see he

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.430 
are even like that too as you can see he
dives<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.120> front<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.510> them<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
dives a lot in front of them so you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.720 
dives a lot in front of them so you
definitely<00:02:37.830> want<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.070> try<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:40.490> roll<00:02:41.490> out<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
definitely want to try to roll out of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.210 
definitely want to try to roll out of
the<00:02:41.910> way<00:02:41.940> right<00:02:42.390> when<00:02:42.510> he's<00:02:42.630> about<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.930> attack

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.940 

so<00:02:47.300> usually<00:02:48.300> what<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.960> take<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.710> couple

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
so usually what I do is I take a couple

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.860 
so usually what I do is I take a couple
hits<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.110> roll<00:02:52.350> out<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> way

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
hits and then just roll out of the way

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.660 
hits and then just roll out of the way
and<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:56.280> usually<00:02:56.430> he'll<00:02:56.910> miss<00:02:57.120> me<00:02:57.410> now<00:02:58.670> he

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
and it usually he'll miss me now he

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
and it usually he'll miss me now he
doesn't<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> couple<00:03:00.330> attacks<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
doesn't have a couple attacks like that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.980 
doesn't have a couple attacks like that
snowball<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.730> instance<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.510> snowball

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
snowball for instance that snowball

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.690 
snowball for instance that snowball
actually<00:03:04.820> hurts<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.940> lot<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.480> will<00:03:07.520> cover<00:03:08.520> you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
actually hurts a lot it will cover you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.340 
actually hurts a lot it will cover you
in<00:03:08.820> snow<00:03:09.120> much<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> bear<00:03:09.900> off<00:03:10.020> covers

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
in snow much like the bear off covers

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.860 
in snow much like the bear off covers
you<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.590> mud<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.840> use<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you in mud and you have to use a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.970 
you in mud and you have to use a
cleanser<00:03:13.140> or<00:03:13.470> something<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:15.590> get<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.709> off<00:03:16.830> you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
cleanser or something to get it off you

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.440 
cleanser or something to get it off you
or<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.280> could<00:03:17.400> roll<00:03:17.610> or<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.970> somebody<00:03:18.270> hit

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
or you could roll or have somebody hit

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.630 
or you could roll or have somebody hit
you<00:03:19.010> he<00:03:20.010> also<00:03:20.160> does<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:21.380> kind<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.530> oh<00:03:22.640> he

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
you he also does that kind of like oh he

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.729 
you he also does that kind of like oh he
bounces<00:03:24.239> backward<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.959> hits<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.500> with<00:03:25.590> his

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
ass no for that move I just kind of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.070 
ass no for that move I just kind of
luckily<00:03:29.280> avoided<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:29.970> usually<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.780> don't<00:03:30.930> see

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
luckily avoided that usually I don't see

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.220 
luckily avoided that usually I don't see
that<00:03:31.200> coming<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:33.060> for<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.540> reason<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:34.050> like

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that coming but for that reason I like

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.900 
that coming but for that reason I like
to<00:03:34.260> stay<00:03:34.530> over<00:03:34.770> towards<00:03:35.100> his<00:03:35.220> side<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:37.910> but

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
