00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.180 
for the right leg and what's cool is
instead<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.510> having<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> four<00:00:52.289> figures

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
instead of just having the four figures

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
instead of just having the four figures
that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> buy<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.329> eight

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that you have to buy there's eight

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
that you have to buy there's eight
figures<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.500> buy<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
figures that you can buy so there's you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.290 
figures that you can buy so there's you
can<00:00:57.840> pick<00:00:58.020> between<00:00:58.280> like<00:00:59.280> Princess<00:00:59.730> Leia<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
can pick between like Princess Leia and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
can pick between like Princess Leia and
knee<00:01:00.690> admin<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.500> however<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> pronounce<00:01:02.070> his

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
knee admin or however you pronounce his

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690 
knee admin or however you pronounce his
name<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> torso<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.309> then<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.610> know

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
name to get the torso and then you know

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.429 
name to get the torso and then you know
like<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.390> there's<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.659> figures<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> torso

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
like so there's two figures of the torso

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.039 
like so there's two figures of the torso
two<00:01:07.890> figures<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> leg<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.720> figures

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
two figures with the leg and two figures

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
two figures with the leg and two figures
with<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> head<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.430> thought<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.880> kind

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
with the head so I thought that was kind

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090 
with the head so I thought that was kind
of<00:01:12.090> cool<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.260> there's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> figure<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of cool so if there's a figure that you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
of cool so if there's a figure that you
don't<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> don't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
don't like you know you don't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't like you know you don't
necessarily<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> pick<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> want

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
necessarily want to pick up but you want

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.210 
necessarily want to pick up but you want
to<00:01:18.420> build<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> droid<00:01:18.930> maybe<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.130> another

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to build the droid maybe there's another

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390 
to build the droid maybe there's another
another<00:01:21.119> option<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.400> find

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
another option for you so you can find

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550 
another option for you so you can find
another<00:01:23.520> figure<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.390> piece<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
another figure to get that piece so I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
another figure to get that piece so I
thought<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.159> cool<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> uh

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

really tiny little knife it's you know
softer<00:02:22.840> rubber<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> didn't<00:02:24.760> want<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> fiddle

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
softer rubber so I didn't want to fiddle

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.340 
softer rubber so I didn't want to fiddle
with<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.510> camera<00:02:25.750> because<00:02:25.960> it's<00:02:26.200> really

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
with it on camera because it's really

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.680 
with it on camera because it's really
hard<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.800> get<00:02:26.920> out<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.210> kind<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.480> hard<00:02:28.660> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
hard to get out and it's kind of hard to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.600 
hard to get out and it's kind of hard to
get<00:02:28.840> back<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.100> kind<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.400> cool<00:02:30.580> that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
get back in but it's kind of cool that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.920 
get back in but it's kind of cool that
it<00:02:31.000> comes<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:33.150> since<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.330> soft<00:02:34.600> rubber

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it comes out so since it's soft rubber

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.760 
it comes out so since it's soft rubber
it<00:02:35.140> doesn't<00:02:35.890> go<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.100> there<00:02:36.250> very<00:02:36.280> easy<00:02:37.770> so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it doesn't go in there very easy so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.120 
it doesn't go in there very easy so
there<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.310> go<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:41.110> very<00:02:41.410> cool<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:42.070> a
