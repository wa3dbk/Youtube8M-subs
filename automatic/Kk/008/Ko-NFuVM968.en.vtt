00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.820
 That's right, I'm here in the lives of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.210
 millions in this video showing how 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.700
 defeat first boss of bank 7 who 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.520
 is geoengineering 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 so let's go to the fight and in this fight and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.140
 two bosses that is the max and treme-treme 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.449
 the max will be playing rockets for 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.130
 the whole struggle bandaged sensations that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.480
 create a red circle on the floor 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 So you have to be one of the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 red circles in step 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 Following 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.239
 these rockets that max shoots too 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 causes a damage in the shakes shakes much chaos 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 damage 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.469
 then the ideal or if they stick together mtl 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:55.410
 Nakano him and expect an ice cream with 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.020
 Landmarks shoot, hit the treme-tremble to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.170
 you watch out to move 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 fast red belt that if you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.949
 is the album you very called 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 damage will probably die 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 so keep an eye on the movement 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 that you see in the red circle below 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 You leave immediately but that's it. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 always near the graveyard of time in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.720
 time he will protect himself in the dark there 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.900
 you have two options one is you absurd 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.640
 a shield to quickly lose it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.100
 the protection and another alternative is you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.009
 Use Your Healing Skills to Heal 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880
 will take the shield of protection for 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.070
 that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 if you do not need healing or can not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.950
 heal you destroy the stopped generator 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.740
 they broke dark 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.009
 and that's it you continue with the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.049
 strategy beating in the shakes always shakes 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.759
 near him by the following achieve and he 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.479
 also 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.140
 and that's it I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.140
