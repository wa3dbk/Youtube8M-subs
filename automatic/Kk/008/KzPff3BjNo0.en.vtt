00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.580 
mean I used to just leave them in the
boxes<00:04:06.819> then<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.030> realized<00:04:07.510> I'd<00:04:08.049> have<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.440> go

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
boxes then I realized I'd have to go

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.830 
boxes then I realized I'd have to go
through<00:04:08.829> every<00:04:09.099> box<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.730> that's<00:04:10.540> kind<00:04:10.750> of

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
through every box and that's kind of

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.220 
through every box and that's kind of
annoying<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:13.000> course<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.510> gets<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.810> bit<00:04:13.840> dusty

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
annoying of course it gets a bit dusty

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.500 
annoying of course it gets a bit dusty
so<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> might<00:04:14.859> put<00:04:15.250> these<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.579> Ziploc<00:04:16.000> bags<00:04:16.269> at
