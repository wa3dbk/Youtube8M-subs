the<00:00:44.910> only<00:00:45.780> reason<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.710> love<00:00:47.010> Inuyasha<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
the only reason that I love Inuyasha is

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
the only reason that I love Inuyasha is
the<00:00:49.739> characters<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.539> really<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the characters I really like the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.819 
the characters I really like the
characters<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.370> had<00:00:54.469> hundreds<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
characters and they had hundreds of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
characters and they had hundreds of
episodes<00:00:56.399> basically<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.250> for<00:01:00.000> forced<00:01:00.570> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
episodes basically to be for forced on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
episodes basically to be for forced on
you<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> didn't<00:01:02.010> feel<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.430> are

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you but I didn't feel that they are

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.270 
you but I didn't feel that they are
necessarily<00:01:03.090> forced<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.650> grew

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
necessarily forced on me they just grew

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
necessarily forced on me they just grew
on<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> came<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:08.720> then

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
on me so what that came down to was then

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
on me so what that came down to was then
being<00:01:10.049> thrown<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:11.010> situations

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
being thrown into all these situations

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.870 
being thrown into all these situations
that<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.299> absolutely<00:01:12.869> pointless<00:01:13.670> when<00:01:14.670> they

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that were absolutely pointless when they

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.039 
that were absolutely pointless when they
really<00:01:15.240> should<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.509> been<00:01:15.689> probably

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
really should have been probably

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
really should have been probably
focusing<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.549> romance<00:01:18.000> comedy<00:01:18.509> thing

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
focusing more on a romance comedy thing

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
focusing more on a romance comedy thing
where<00:01:19.049> they've<00:01:19.200> been<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.619> action

where they've been all this action

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
where they've been all this action
because<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> actors<00:01:20.790> didn't<00:01:21.060> work<00:01:21.560> naraku

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
because the actors didn't work naraku

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.390 
because the actors didn't work naraku
the<00:01:23.100> villain<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:24.090> total<00:01:24.840> shit<00:01:25.140> why<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.369> a
