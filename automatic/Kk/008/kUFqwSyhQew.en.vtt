00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
make this video so that you could be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.729 
make this video so that you could be
aware<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.750> how<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.769> many<00:02:40.120> development

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
aware of how to get as many development

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.500 
aware of how to get as many development
this<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:42.950> way<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.000> go<00:02:44.360> in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
this is the way to do it you just go in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:03:06.569 
this is the way to do it you just go in
there<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.720> stripe<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.319> mess<00:02:45.560> out<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.799> them

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.130 

they're<00:03:07.579> coming<00:03:07.760> into<00:03:08.030> their<00:03:08.239> lawn<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.750> they

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
they're coming into their lawn and they

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.800 
they're coming into their lawn and they
can<00:03:09.320> barely<00:03:09.620> get<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.890> mode<00:03:10.130> or<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.640> company

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.090 

there's<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.900> technique<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.320> stripe<00:03:15.769> there's<00:03:16.040> a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
there's a technique to stripe there's a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.979 
there's a technique to stripe there's a
certain<00:03:16.579> length<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.180> cut<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.810> to

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
certain length of cut you have to

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.949 
certain length of cut you have to
accomplish<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:19.340> stripe<00:03:19.940> lawns<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.870> know

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
accomplish to stripe lawns you know

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.250 
accomplish to stripe lawns you know
there's<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> couple<00:03:21.380> techniques<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.010> use<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
there's a couple techniques I use and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.810 
there's a couple techniques I use and
this<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.560> best<00:03:24.769> way<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.430> no<00:03:25.640> other

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
this is the best way there is no other

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.009 
this is the best way there is no other
to<00:03:26.150> my<00:03:26.600> opinion<00:03:26.989> there's<00:03:27.709> no<00:03:27.890> other<00:03:28.040> way<00:03:28.310> to

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
to my opinion there's no other way to

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.550 
to my opinion there's no other way to
jump<00:03:30.019> up<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.400> really<00:03:31.989> dominate<00:03:32.989> other

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
jump up and and really dominate other
