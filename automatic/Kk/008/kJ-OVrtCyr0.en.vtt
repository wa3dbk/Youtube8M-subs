00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 this is the front hand in other words straight 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.810
 front 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.139
 apply front search front 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.139
 body surface head from a low rack 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.500
 - bed 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.500
 solar plexus liver and spleen and 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 brutal fuck 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 or in the lower abdomen area this is how 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.129
 looks from there in slow motion 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.780
 image look and from the back and 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.320
 chest 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.320
 mirror reflection 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.589
 first phase charging 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:09.200
 but lowering the second phase here is position 3 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.200
 phase and break charge 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:27.820
 rapprochement of defeat atf separately 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 the phases are a mystery 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.560
 pushes for go round turns the body 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.140
 hand turns nails up fist 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.340
 unfolds nails up from lie 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:49.420
 the arm is free 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.910
 the back foot here comes the riddle 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 convergence 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.510
 hands rushes forward to the target and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.290
 note 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.869
 elbow does not rise need not hit i 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.640
 how to raise your hand in the enemy as 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.300
 corkscrew 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 turn and I'm at the expense of the brush 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:20.580
 Here phase defeat pro fighter stands here 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:24.679
 feel such a separation from them 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.679
 [music] 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.970
 Now let's see how it looks in 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.970
 slow motion image 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.880
 like this 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.360
 another phase chickens unscrews for the fighter here 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:49.110
 such a 6 ti na for defeat and detachment club 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 wraps his little finger up the process 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.460
 blow so work arm tarsky shoulders 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460
 so the legs work 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.199
 [music] 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.810
 it is working out on a paw 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.990
 on all three levels 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.990
 [music] 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:21.200
 as you can see very powerful and dangerous topics 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.300
 that the enemy against a spoonful of water knead 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.650
 its started your starts from the periphery 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.160
 visual field almost to the knee although 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.170
 someone is called direct he is something 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.090
 akin to and uppercut remains although common 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.960
 direction of impact from the inside 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.880
 rings cleaning period you see 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.040
 working out at 5 kilograms normal 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:55.460
 otherwise especially effective for abrupt 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:04:03.440
 aggressive people fail especially 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:04.600
 well especially one is called arc 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.270
 out 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.350
 he looks like a Pinocchio but unlike 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.489
 hurricane is applied not to the side of the back not to 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.620
 side from translation as you can see 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.930
 the performer goes again in attacking 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.720
 rack 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.520
 applied to the ear temple area with this 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.450
 Be careful in English 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.800
 possible death in the jaw in 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.490
 general strike is struck first 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.870
 side surface of the head here from there to 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.600
 slow motion image 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.080
 here we are charging 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:47.139
 [music] 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.729
 Now we are closer's defeat 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.669
 hand drawn forward 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.099
 the fighter comes out just such a stand and the gap 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:58.319
 although the gap for this blow is not very 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.319
 characteristic look again 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.820
 [music] 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.620
 notice the reflection in the mirror 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.620
 so it will be easier to understand the blow 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.310
 immediately defeat the fighter is worth such 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.740
 such a cleaning feel just such a rack 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.260
 he comes almost directly 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.470
 before contacting the mix to reverse 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.870
 attention to the movement of the brush I treasure 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:36.370
 compressed crimped only last 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:38.830
 the moment here is a blow divided by pathos here 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:46.919
 charging phase 1 phase 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:46.919
 [music] 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:57.740
 vase rarely goes into a rapprochement 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.740
 notice the brush 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:07.860
 [music] 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:10.289
 from hitting the shortest phase but 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.229
 most responsible 2 for defeat where 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:19.350
 merge and movement of the body and legs and 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:22.560
 hands and finally tearing over here again 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:30.449
 look thing even slow 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:33.419
 I like the image that is common 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.110
 direction of strikes first though 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.990
 sleep side surface important like this 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.100
 running arm shoulders and torso on impact 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.100
 [music] 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.530
 strikes with his front hand like this 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:55.650
 many work 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:59.310
 [music] 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:03.060
 here is working off like here and good 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:06.830
 it is clear that the period is going to be seen as 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.050
 takes the opponent back partner back 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:13.460
 very powerful very hard blow which 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.460
 can finish will 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.260
 here is working on the sword 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.260
 [music] 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:37.620
 strike out slightly relaxed 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.099
 provisions do not need to cry fast before 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.099
 blow
