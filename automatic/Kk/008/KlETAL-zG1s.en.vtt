vaikka<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.659> did<00:00:42.049> some<00:00:42.199> research<00:00:42.379> into<00:00:42.799> what

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
vaikka so I did some research into what

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.430 
vaikka so I did some research into what
bikes<00:00:43.250> were<00:00:43.489> available<00:00:43.820> funeral<00:00:44.420> wise<00:00:44.629> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
bikes were available funeral wise and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.780 
bikes were available funeral wise and
there<00:00:45.589> was<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> guy<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:45.890> started<00:00:46.309> up<00:00:46.640> with

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
there was a guy that started up with

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.579 
there was a guy that started up with
sidecar<00:00:47.269> outfit<00:00:47.629> that's<00:00:48.049> for<00:00:48.199> granny<00:00:48.379> in<00:00:48.559> the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
sidecar outfit that's for granny in the

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.119 
sidecar outfit that's for granny in the
kids<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.790> I<00:00:50.119> built<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.629> try<00:00:50.930> curson<00:00:51.409> trailer<00:00:51.799> but

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
kids so I built a try curson trailer but

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.000 
kids so I built a try curson trailer but
the<00:00:52.909> trailer<00:00:53.269> bounced<00:00:53.629> on<00:00:53.720> a<00:00:53.750> rough<00:00:53.989> road<00:00:54.199> so

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
the trailer bounced on a rough road so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.799 
the trailer bounced on a rough road so
then<00:00:55.159> we<00:00:55.250> thought<00:00:55.280> right<00:00:55.479> let's<00:00:56.479> build<00:00:56.750> a

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
then we thought right let's build a

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.049 
then we thought right let's build a
one-piece<00:00:57.199> bespoke<00:00:57.650> vehicle<00:00:58.100> discovered<00:00:58.970> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
one-piece bespoke vehicle discovered the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.700 
one-piece bespoke vehicle discovered the
triumph<00:00:59.420> rocket<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.839> biggest<00:01:00.170> bike<00:01:00.350> engine

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
triumph rocket the biggest bike engine

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
triumph rocket the biggest bike engine
on<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.920> planet<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.030> off<00:01:02.150> we<00:01:02.180> went

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on the planet and off we went

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
on the planet and off we went
it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.290> powerful<00:01:04.470> machine<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.070> 130

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's a pretty powerful machine at 130

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's a pretty powerful machine at 130
brake<00:01:05.939> horsepower<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> speed

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
brake horsepower what kind of speed

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
brake horsepower what kind of speed
today<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> might<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.400> too<00:01:08.610> well

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
today you think you might get too well

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
today you think you might get too well
it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> record<00:01:09.479> unless<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.259> turn

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it's not a record unless I do the turn

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's not a record unless I do the turn
is<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> ton<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> tongue

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
is it so for a ton to do the tongue

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800 
is it so for a ton to do the tongue
that's<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.530> achievement<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.630> have

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's some achievement now you have

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
that's some achievement now you have
this<00:01:15.960> built<00:01:16.229> locally<00:01:16.409> Pantha<00:01:17.040> trikes<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.610> think

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this built locally Pantha trikes I think

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
this built locally Pantha trikes I think
so<00:01:18.240> tell<00:01:18.720> us<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:18.899> bit<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so tell us a little bit about the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
so tell us a little bit about the
construction<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> creation<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> well

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
construction and the creation of it well

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740 
construction and the creation of it well
basically<00:01:21.720> Joe<00:01:22.590> caught<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> vision<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
basically Joe caught the vision and I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.930 
basically Joe caught the vision and I
let<00:01:25.259> him<00:01:25.320> run<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> provided<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.789> bike

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
let him run with it I provided the bike

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.730 
let him run with it I provided the bike
and<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.539> went<00:01:27.780> ahead<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> designed<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.649> built

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and he went ahead and designed and built

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
and he went ahead and designed and built
it<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.070> basically<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.940> it's<00:01:30.210> still

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it and basically it's it's it's still

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.910 
it and basically it's it's it's still
built<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> quality<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> workmanship

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
built the quality of the workmanship

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
built the quality of the workmanship
spur<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.369> tastic<00:01:32.820> you've<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.570> mile

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
spur on tastic you've got about a mile

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
spur on tastic you've got about a mile
to<00:01:34.320> build<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.619> speed<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.399> get

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to build up speed and then you get

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.859 
to build up speed and then you get
measured<00:01:35.880> through<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.149> trap<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.690> right

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
measured through the trap is that right

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.419 
measured through the trap is that right
yeah<00:01:37.110> we've<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> one-mile<00:01:37.830> camera<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
yeah we've got a one-mile camera and

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.490 
yeah we've got a one-mile camera and
then<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:38.880> point<00:01:39.119> four<00:01:39.390> mile<00:01:39.630> camera<00:01:40.050> so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then at one point four mile camera so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
then at one point four mile camera so
we'll<00:01:40.679> get<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.860> speed<00:01:41.280> measurements<00:01:41.819> gayness

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we'll get to speed measurements gayness

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.899 
we'll get to speed measurements gayness
have<00:01:42.630> stipulated<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:43.890> need<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> recorded

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
have stipulated that we need a recorded

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
have stipulated that we need a recorded
evidence<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.259> over<00:01:46.530> 80<00:01:46.800> miles<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.280> hour<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
evidence of over 80 miles an hour and
