00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that dark-skinned girls could really

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.319 
that dark-skinned girls could really
pull<00:02:17.780> off<00:02:17.930> blush<00:02:18.379> but<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.549> I'm<00:02:19.730> maturing<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
pull off blush but as I'm maturing and

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.520 
pull off blush but as I'm maturing and
older<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.599> feel<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.049> can<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.260> whatever<00:02:21.409> I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.410 
older I feel like I can do whatever I
want<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.799> do<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.189> it<00:02:22.549> does<00:02:22.790> look<00:02:22.969> good<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.269> me

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
