00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 a greeting to all the part of piero g 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.689
 bardot and luca marchegiani 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 xavier what invitation did you make me pro 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.949
 evolution soccer 2013 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 comes the usual terrible challenge 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.289
 autumn really fit with a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 product that attempts to mediate between 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.969
 immediacy and simulation to duty 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.040
 get off the Juventus and Florentine camps 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 in short, many steps forward but also the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 old problems not solved for a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.370
 product that really marks a turning point 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.260
 compared to the past year 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.260
 these routes of choices 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.870
 in short, if you want to know everything about pro 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 evolution soccer 2013 beware of the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.800
 our video review 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.490
 it begins 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.680
 pes and fifa have always represented 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.570
 the two opposites of the football genus col 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.729
 first to identify in the eyes of fans 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 the perfect simulation the second 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 instead of representing a type of game 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.369
 more simplified over the years 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
 things have radically changed the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.520
 transition to the current generation of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.350
 console marked a change of trend 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.450
 who saw luzon soccer 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.789
 slow down and turn towards a vein more 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.799
 arcade without abandoning all those 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.659
 historical flaws that the series is always 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.820
 brought things back fortunately 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.310
 it seems they are changing and already last 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.960
 year with pes 2012 were registered i 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.659
 first positive signs for a breakthrough 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 again simulative and it is from this 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.130
 idea that was born pro evolution soccer 2013 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.569
 an edition that aims to offer one 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 instant play perspective e 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.440
 funny but that does not leave in the background 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.770
 those in search of realism and 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.770
 simulation 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 change everything 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.649
 from 2013 it presents itself with a series of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.220
 contents quite similar to the last 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.020
 edition 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.030
 in particular with regard to the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 game modes as always as you can 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.660
 dispute the leagues more amicably 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.430
 important and its pairs 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 internationals including the much-loved 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.239
 champions league is not lacking even i 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 various tournaments typical of the series ones 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.900
 for the national and the mode becomes 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.730
 a myth that in the football life section 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.739
 is joined by the master league 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.660
 the latter in particular what it is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.700
 the terms have been further adjusted 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.319
 of options in this edition do 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.030
 in fact their appearance the coaches 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.950
 and you can buy and items 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
 specific to enrich the program of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.010
 team training 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.989
 the specific training section 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.519
 allows you to learn all the best 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.620
 novelty of the gameplay through a 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.239
 interesting and complete tutorial while 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.709
 from the extra content page is 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.080
 You can download updated roses 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 even online gaming is conceptually 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.440
 similar to the one seen in the previous one 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.750
 episode of the series with matches 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.370
 classified tournaments and communities 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.319
 the latter embellished by several 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.690
 interface novelties and management 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.100
 but the heart of the menu remains 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 once again the online master league 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.850
 who finally enjoys a system of 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.739
 evolved matchmaking that allows you to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.630
 split players into rankings a 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.130
 depending on their skill level in 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.810
 this way you can create some 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.070
 more balanced meetings based 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.870
 to the experience of each user 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.340
 in short, as regards the game in 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.690
 net the konami series did 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.850
 definitely a big step forward 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.579
 as far as the game itself 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.170
 three key elements of pes 2013 are the 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.940
 pass call control allows the player 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.859
 to have an almost total control of the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.900
 athletes on the field what translates 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.900
 in the ability to perform in a manner 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.340
 completely manual pulls and passes 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.650
 obtaining more natural trajectories and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.420
 credible improvements also for what 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.489
 regards the changes of sudden directions 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.959
 not very fluid but at least not 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.280
 suffer from noticeable delays 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.230
 of the 2012 edition 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.450
 the second novelty is the so-called 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.859
 proactiv veizaj the new intelligence 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.600
 artificial able to make move 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.850
 fellow opponents more 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.500
 credible teams act so 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.269
 different depending on the technical level 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 own players as well as 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.670
 adopted schemes or individual reactions 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.920
 athletes 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.380
 to complete it all there is what 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.060
 developers called haiti player 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.890
 or a system by which i 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.810
 most famous players adopt 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.710
 behaviors more similar to those of the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.040
 real counterparties 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.120
 making every athlete truly unique 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.860
 unfortunately some automatisms remain 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.600
 in certain actions where the computer 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.580
 seems to intrude and pilot 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.930
 certain situations also the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.120
 goalkeeper behavior even though 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.780
 improved sometimes appears strange and little 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 realistic 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.650
 2013 konami has done very well 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.389
 I work in increasing the set of 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.400
 animations of the athletes giving them the 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.199
 movements even more fluid and consistent 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.699
 while the same speech applies to the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.289
 making meshes aimed at the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.520
 players 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.199
 unfortunately there are ups and downs for 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.819
 regarding the stages that are for 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.039
 most just average 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.050
 switching to the sound component yes 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.300
 note improvements in the less fake choirs 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.009
 of the past and much more synchronized 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.569
 with what they have in the field as well as 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.099
 the commentary is very good 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.720
 once again entrusted to Pierluigi 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.820
 pardo and luca marchegiani 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.590
 the rhythm of their comment appears more 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.360
 continuous and dynamic compared to the past 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.979
 especially of course when they are disputing 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.410
 tournaments covered by official licenses 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.220
 cartel matches and inside competitions 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.220
 of famous stadiums 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.509
 year after year konami seems finally 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.460
 being able to create a pro evolution 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.650
 soccer with its own precise identity 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.270
 as for the gameplay it has it 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.710
 made by mixing together elements of 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.050
 simulation gameplay with others 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.330
 decidedly more immediate in a strange one 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.219
 mix that partially returns to the public 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.979
 of enthusiasts a more footballing title 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.509
 however, reasoned and less arcade remain 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.129
 some defects partly derived from 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.590
 this new formula they make appear 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.599
 pro volution soccer 2013 as a title 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.370
 transitional especially if yes 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.319
 consider that the title still limps 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.210
 in terms of upgrade licenses 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:00.580
 complete with roses and an experience 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.580
 online not like the competition
