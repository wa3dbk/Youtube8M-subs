00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
two two and a half hours with my

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.290 
two two and a half hours with my
subscribers<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.460> we<00:04:37.700> were<00:04:37.789> just<00:04:37.820> wrecking

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
subscribers and we were just wrecking

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.839 
subscribers and we were just wrecking
like<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.599> don't<00:04:38.659> think<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:38.990> lost<00:04:39.140> at<00:04:39.800> all

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
like I don't think we lost at all

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.029 
like I don't think we lost at all
and<00:04:41.319> use<00:04:42.319> it<00:04:42.740> was<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.189> blast<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:44.330> say<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.509> least

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
and use it was a blast to say the least

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.559 
and use it was a blast to say the least
and<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:47.569> think<00:04:48.110> this<00:04:48.319> match<00:04:48.589> I<00:04:48.770> was<00:04:48.889> actually

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
and I think this match I was actually

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:56.109 
and I think this match I was actually
lagging<00:04:50.569> a<00:04:50.689> lot<00:04:51.219> so<00:04:52.719> that<00:04:53.719> sucks<00:04:54.199> but<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.189> see

00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:56.119 
lagging a lot so that sucks but I see

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:58.749 
lagging a lot so that sucks but I see
here<00:04:56.389> i<00:04:56.619> think<00:04:57.619> the<00:04:57.889> match<00:04:58.039> is<00:04:58.219> almost<00:04:58.429> over<00:04:58.729> i

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
here i think the match is almost over i

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.179 
here i think the match is almost over i
have<00:04:58.939> my<00:04:59.059> gunship<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.689> this<00:05:00.679> is<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.979> laggy
