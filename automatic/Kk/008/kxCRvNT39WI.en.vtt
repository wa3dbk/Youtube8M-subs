00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that good with the suppressor especially

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
that good with the suppressor especially
especially<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> play<00:00:48.539> ground<00:00:48.870> war<00:00:49.219> 99

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
especially if you play ground war 99
domination<00:00:50.940> you'll<00:00:51.329> need<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:52.100> you'll<00:00:53.100> need

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
domination you'll need about you'll need

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
domination you'll need about you'll need
all<00:00:53.460> those<00:00:53.640> extra<00:00:54.120> damage<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.600> suppressor

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
all those extra damage that suppressor

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
all those extra damage that suppressor
that<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.379> can't<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.039> suppressor<00:00:56.340> takes<00:00:56.610> away

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that it can't the suppressor takes away

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
that it can't the suppressor takes away
some<00:00:57.090> damage<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:57.989> more

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
some damage and a little bit more

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
some damage and a little bit more
accuracy<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> takes<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.550> longer<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
accuracy so it takes a lot longer to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.200 
accuracy so it takes a lot longer to
kill<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.420> suppressor<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.640> downsides

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
kill with suppressor but the downsides

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.399

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
honestly it is not that much at all I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.690

don't<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.369> something

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
don't get what it is it's just something

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
don't get what it is it's just something
about<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> gun<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.439> 33<00:01:49.439> bullets<00:01:49.799> isn't

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.740 
about the gun that 33 bullets isn't
enough<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> kill<00:01:50.610> especially<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> ground

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
enough to kill especially in ground
