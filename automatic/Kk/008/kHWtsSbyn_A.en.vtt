00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.319 
taking them off it kind of just has a
little<00:02:25.200> bit<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.379> pain<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.180> not

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
little bit of pain there and it's not

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.959 
little bit of pain there and it's not
major<00:02:27.719> but<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:29.159> all<00:02:29.280> headphones<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.939> a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
major but as with all headphones it's a

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.399 
major but as with all headphones it's a
very<00:02:30.180> personal<00:02:30.480> thing<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.260> should

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
very personal thing and you should

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.289 
very personal thing and you should
probably<00:02:31.650> give<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.219> try<00:02:32.459> yourself<00:02:32.639> before

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
probably give them a try yourself before

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.530 
probably give them a try yourself before
you<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:34.170> them<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:35.060> received<00:02:36.060> them<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> gift

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you get them I received them as a gift

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.869 
you get them I received them as a gift
so<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.260> didn't<00:02:37.799> really<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.159> luxury

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
so I didn't really have that luxury

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.369 
so I didn't really have that luxury
but<00:02:39.389> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:39.780> headphones<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.230> should

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
but I think with headphones you should

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.809 
but I think with headphones you should
always<00:02:40.500> give<00:02:40.739> them<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.920> try<00:02:41.159> before<00:02:41.219> you<00:02:41.549> buy

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
always give them a try before you buy

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.929 
always give them a try before you buy
them<00:02:43.099> but<00:02:44.099> still<00:02:44.280> they're<00:02:44.549> they're<00:02:44.909> not

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
them but still they're they're not

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.909 
them but still they're they're not
something<00:02:45.599> made<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.500> still

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
something made here and they are still

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.349 
something made here and they are still
very<00:02:47.099> comfortable<00:02:47.340> wearing<00:02:47.879> them<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
very comfortable wearing them like this

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.429 
very comfortable wearing them like this
and<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:49.620> might<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.829> be<00:02:49.980> my<00:02:50.159> ear<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:52.139> they<00:02:52.230> kind

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
and it might just be my ear so they kind

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.170 
and it might just be my ear so they kind
of<00:02:52.470> chill<00:02:52.709> which<00:02:52.919> does<00:02:53.099> help<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.370> when<00:02:54.090> I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
of chill which does help that when I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.550 
of chill which does help that when I
first<00:02:54.419> got<00:02:54.569> them<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.989> didn't<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.409> check

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
first got them I didn't really check

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.750 
first got them I didn't really check
about<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.859> left<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> was<00:02:56.549> wearing

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
about the left and right I was wearing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.729 
about the left and right I was wearing
the<00:02:56.879> backwards<00:02:57.359> and<00:02:57.659> they're<00:02:58.230> pushing<00:02:58.439> even

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
the backwards and they're pushing even

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.220 
the backwards and they're pushing even
harder<00:02:59.010> which<00:02:59.129> was<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> problem<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.019> if<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.109> keep

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
harder which was a problem so if we keep

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.610 
harder which was a problem so if we keep
moving<00:03:01.379> down<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.919> can<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.189> cable<00:03:02.519> here

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
moving down you can see the cable here

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.640 
moving down you can see the cable here
well<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.859> zoom<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.129> on<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.199 

see<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.799> very<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.459> kind<00:03:11.669> of<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.909> thin

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
see it's a very it's kind of like a thin

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.379 
see it's a very it's kind of like a thin
plastic<00:03:12.889> like<00:03:13.889> a<00:03:13.919> flat<00:03:14.489> cable<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.150> very

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
plastic like a flat cable it's very

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.390 
plastic like a flat cable it's very
durable<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:16.409> I've<00:03:16.530> kind<00:03:16.919> of<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.189> it<00:03:17.280> through

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
durable and I've kind of put it through

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.140 
durable and I've kind of put it through
some<00:03:18.530> tests<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.889> very<00:03:20.250> durable<00:03:20.819> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
some tests and it's very durable and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.369 
some tests and it's very durable and
strong<00:03:23.299> it's<00:03:24.299> nice<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.599> it's<00:03:25.019> flat<00:03:25.319> like

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
strong it's nice that it's flat like

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.849 
strong it's nice that it's flat like
this<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.889> makes<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.129> feel<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.609> durable

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.159 

there's<00:03:31.859> just<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.159> design<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.729> side

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
there's just this design on the side

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:39.800 
there's just this design on the side
they<00:03:34.169> look<00:03:34.319> pretty<00:03:34.470> cool<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.979> like<00:03:35.069> them<00:03:38.810> but

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
they look pretty cool I like them but

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.360 
they look pretty cool I like them but
looking<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.260> headphone<00:03:40.590> cable<00:03:40.949> it's<00:03:41.069> nice

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
looking at the headphone cable it's nice

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.749 
looking at the headphone cable it's nice
and<00:03:41.609> then<00:03:41.699> if<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.879> keep<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.090> down<00:03:43.759> here's

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
and then if you keep going down here's

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.469 
and then if you keep going down here's
where<00:03:44.939> they<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.449> into<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.810> one<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:47.479> here's

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
where they go into the one and here's

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.179 
where they go into the one and here's
one<00:03:48.689> of<00:03:48.780> my<00:03:48.840> complaints<00:03:49.139> about<00:03:49.379> it<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
one of my complaints about it the

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.349 
one of my complaints about it the
headphone<00:03:50.579> cable<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.269> think<00:03:51.689> if<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.439> can<00:03:53.359> in

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
headphone cable I think if you can in

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:54.830 
headphone cable I think if you can in
here

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
here

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.429 
here
I<00:03:55.639> just<00:03:56.639> find<00:03:56.879> it<00:03:57.000> far<00:03:57.329> too<00:03:57.629> long<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.259> guess

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
I just find it far too long I guess

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.319 
I just find it far too long I guess
that's<00:03:58.650> good<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:59.009> DJs<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.819> people<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.239> are

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
that's good for DJs and people that are

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.020 
that's good for DJs and people that are
very<00:04:00.599> very<00:04:00.840> very<00:04:01.139> tall<00:04:01.439> and<00:04:02.099> I'm<00:04:02.699> not<00:04:02.879> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
very very very tall and I'm not that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.240 
very very very tall and I'm not that
short<00:04:03.329> I'm<00:04:03.509> a<00:04:03.540> pretty<00:04:03.810> tall<00:04:04.049> person<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> these

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
short I'm a pretty tall person and these

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.550 
short I'm a pretty tall person and these
are<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.939> long<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.509> just<00:04:07.199> think<00:04:07.409> they're<00:04:07.530> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
are really long I just think they're a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
are really long I just think they're a
little<00:04:07.650> bit<00:04:07.859> too<00:04:08.099> long<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.000> that's<00:04:09.180> kind<00:04:09.449> of

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
little bit too long and that's kind of

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.110 
little bit too long and that's kind of
one<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.780> complaints<00:04:10.199> of<00:04:10.290> -<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.680> wish<00:04:10.859> those

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
one of the complaints of - I wish those

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.770 
one of the complaints of - I wish those
shorter<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.419> they're<00:04:12.569> more<00:04:12.720> manageable

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
shorter so that they're more manageable

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.879 
shorter so that they're more manageable
if<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.900> look<00:04:16.019> at<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.199> middle<00:04:16.409> part<00:04:16.560> here<00:04:16.739> it's

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
if you look at the middle part here it's

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.879 
if you look at the middle part here it's
nice<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:18.030> know<00:04:18.060> compact<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.680> then<00:04:19.799> it

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
nice and you know compact and then it

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.860 
nice and you know compact and then it
goes<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.669> basically<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> goes<00:04:21.299> from<00:04:21.509> two

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
goes it's basically it goes from two

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.310
