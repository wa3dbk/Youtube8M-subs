 Door also it I there is a novelty bath here 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:24.300
 And I will also learn something from flat faces 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 me 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 We waited for if we could not find anything like a bathhouse 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:53.770
 We will guide you if you are an experience student 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.820
 There are 3 subjects in 10 specialized courses whether or not this thing will be guided to the bathhouse 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.480
 Consulate 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.950
 Each has a highly specialized curriculum and a full complement of instructors. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.330
 It seems to be 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:12.460
 Oh Maybe 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 There may be a key to solve the mystery of the flat-faced Sword civilization here 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.710
 This is a character design course In this course it seems like a character 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.160
 It is to wear until, of course cg and illustrations technique to learn the design 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.160
 I can do it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.910
 Apparently they are happy 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:37.110
 Now the students are in the process of creating attractive characters by saying Character Design Works 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm learning 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 Flat-faced people draw rice 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.840
 It challenged 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.619
 Investigate by leaving Nyoro to Hirota 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.619
 Is too close 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.200
 This character design 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.480
 I do not care 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 This is so-called delicious 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.180
 se 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 Said cormorant 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.860
 I'm 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.039
 To a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:12.180
 There is a seemingly those between non-natural is drawn something 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.480
 Then here is the eye course for the character 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.940
 The animation work that moves the picture is a wood stick or rose 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.350
 The 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.480
 I can not concentrate on learning the video techniques I have 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.510
 The Shah who also seems to be a painter 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 But different from before 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.550
 Use this ride box 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.810
 I'm changing the video while I'm turning my hair 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:39.500
 What is the mechanism of this glowing box 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.190
 How many slaves are used in this box ? 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.299
 Moreover , I may not have written the same a from a while ago 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.299
 Whether the new method of torture 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.400
 Benny was changing little by little 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.410
 Nice nice nice nice nice nice 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.460

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.670
 It is a good Iiiiiiii Gutchiron 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.819
 Stand we 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:16.359
 I am ashamed of the name of the Romans if I get upset by something like this 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:20.140
 Finally the voice actor talent course The active voice actor becomes a lecturer and the necessary know-how on the spot 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:23.130
 It said that there is no technique and acting ability and heart 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.130
 I will tell you 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.060
 It has eyes on what the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.020
 I'm clearing one item per bell 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.050
 The a 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.569
 What this move is good 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.340
 This is equivalent to occur 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:45.170
 Here is an audio recording studio for recording voices 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.170
 The same environment as a professional site, so full-fledged learning is possible 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.940
 I did it 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:57.360
 With the beginning of the device of the road writer Nia Mia 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.360
 The only thing I understand is that it is only a picture 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.280
 No 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.150
 Is this a voice to the meeting? 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.050
 It looks like the picture is alive 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.900
 And 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.900
 Animation completed by combining the voice and picture recorded by 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.579
 Awesome me 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.740

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.330
 New art increase 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.880
 Here to have a lot of attractive things are not right now in Rome 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.880
 It is a mountain of treasure 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.790
 But what do these people do 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.849
 A lively figure that works hard towards your own dreams 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:48.680
 This is probably supporting a flat subsequent advanced civilization 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:51.919
 All this time I want to take home to Rome was now are more than tired customers 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.970
 For those who have come to visit by post now 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.970
 Do not touch this menu 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.980
 Well What time Cho countries have not seen those of such precise make 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.000
 Is this all right or various? 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.870

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.870

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:23.850
 Feelings do since, such as Boolean Mr. stove top is this or subordinates of What a way
