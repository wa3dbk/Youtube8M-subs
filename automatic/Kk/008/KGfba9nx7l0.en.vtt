mark i weighed in yesterday and i'm

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640 
mark i weighed in yesterday and i'm
happy<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.220> say<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> i<00:00:30.179> am<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:31.080> five<00:00:31.439> more

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
happy to say that i am down five more

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
happy to say that i am down five more
pounds<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.090> makes<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.480> grand<00:00:33.750> total

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
pounds so that makes my grand total

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.170 
pounds so that makes my grand total
weight<00:00:34.260> loss<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.770> four<00:00:34.980> weeks<00:00:35.390> 28<00:00:36.390> pounds<00:00:37.070> its

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
weight loss in four weeks 28 pounds its

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.580 
weight loss in four weeks 28 pounds its
approximate<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.390> i<00:00:39.570> met<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.899> parents<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
approximate because i met my parents and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.639 
approximate because i met my parents and
it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.370> scale<00:00:42.260> they<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> those

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it's a different scale they one of those

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's a different scale they one of those
dials<00:00:44.219> scales<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.210> 10<00:00:45.480> years<00:00:45.690> old<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
dials scales that's like 10 years old so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440 
dials scales that's like 10 years old so
I'm<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> comparing<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I'm just kind of comparing it to the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.709 
I'm just kind of comparing it to the
week<00:00:48.660> before<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.280> tell

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
week before it's really hard to tell

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.119 
week before it's really hard to tell
because<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> move<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.500> scale<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
because when you move on the scale the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
because when you move on the scale the
dial<00:00:53.460> goes<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.809> looks<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
dial goes up and down but it looks like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.760 
dial goes up and down but it looks like
about<00:00:55.289> 5<00:00:55.530> pounds<00:00:55.850> once<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.149> home<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.770> use

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about 5 pounds once i get home and use

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
about 5 pounds once i get home and use
my<00:00:58.949> own<00:00:59.070> scale<00:00:59.399> again<00:00:59.699> i'll<00:00:59.940> probably<00:01:00.329> know

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
my own scale again i'll probably know

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.529 
my own scale again i'll probably know
better<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.270> I'm

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
better if if it's right or not so I'm

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.630 
better if if it's right or not so I'm
going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.809> say<00:01:03.960> five<00:01:04.559> pounds<00:01:04.890> um<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:07.340> am<00:01:08.340> doing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
going to say five pounds um I am doing

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.149
