00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
what you need all of these drums is you

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.790 
what you need all of these drums is you
need<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.300> come<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:04.680> everything

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
need to come in and have everything

need to come in and have everything
where<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.460> want<00:05:05.730> yeah<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.510> said<00:05:06.930> something<00:05:07.200> is

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
where you want yeah I said something is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.650 
where you want yeah I said something is
done<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.670> here<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.480> made<00:05:09.630> a

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
done as you can see here we made a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.240 
done as you can see here we made a
system<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:10.230> goes<00:05:10.350> directly<00:05:10.560> into<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
system that goes directly into the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.070 
system that goes directly into the
rising<00:05:11.670> for<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.120> elaborate<00:05:12.540> so<00:05:12.690> what<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.960> does

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
rising for the elaborate so what it does

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.990 
rising for the elaborate so what it does
is<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.620> eliminates<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:14.190> lot<00:05:14.220> of<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.460> front<00:05:14.730> bars

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
is it eliminates a lot of the front bars

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.790 
is it eliminates a lot of the front bars
here<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.870> know<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.110> mean<00:05:16.260> as<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.500> notice

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
here you know the mean as you notice

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.080 
here you know the mean as you notice
this<00:05:17.100> two<00:05:17.760> different<00:05:17.880> sections<00:05:18.210> right<00:05:18.600> here

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
this two different sections right here

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.990 
this two different sections right here
section<00:05:21.090> here

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
section here

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.020 
section here
intersection<00:05:22.960> here<00:05:23.190> now<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.760> Pole

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
intersection here now this this Pole

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.000 
intersection here now this this Pole
right<00:05:25.060> here<00:05:25.390> pretty<00:05:25.570> much<00:05:25.840> holds<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.800> two

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
right here pretty much holds the two

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.890 
right here pretty much holds the two
floors<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.370> make<00:05:27.520> all<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.330> symbols<00:05:28.630> over<00:05:28.690> the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
floors and make all the symbols over the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.110 
floors and make all the symbols over the
side<00:05:29.310> now<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.340> using<00:05:31.110> less<00:05:32.110> amount<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.620> rat<00:05:33.490> but

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
side now so using less amount of rat but

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:44.460 
side now so using less amount of rat but
just<00:05:34.300> using<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:34.960> in<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.260> very<00:05:35.440> unusual<00:05:36.160> way<00:05:43.470> now

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
just using it in a very unusual way now

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.630 
just using it in a very unusual way now
one<00:05:44.650> thing<00:05:44.800> we<00:05:44.920> didn't<00:05:45.070> talk<00:05:45.130> about<00:05:45.220> with<00:05:45.520> the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
one thing we didn't talk about with the

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.250 
one thing we didn't talk about with the
bass<00:05:45.820> drums<00:05:46.120> over<00:05:46.300> here<00:05:46.510> actually<00:05:46.870> I'm<00:05:47.140> just

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
bass drums over here actually I'm just

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.250 
bass drums over here actually I'm just
noticing<00:05:47.710> you've<00:05:48.370> got<00:05:48.610> your<00:05:48.940> main<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.870> 22

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
noticing you've got your main is it a 22

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.750 
noticing you've got your main is it a 22
ever<00:05:50.590> use<00:05:50.800> one<00:05:50.980> of<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.100> arms<00:05:51.340> what<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.670> you

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
ever use one of the arms what it's you

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.090 
ever use one of the arms what it's you
over<00:05:52.000> there<00:05:52.150> okay<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.810> then<00:05:53.200> off<00:05:53.740> to<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
over there okay and then off to the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.730 
over there okay and then off to the
right<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.640> that<00:05:54.880> is<00:05:55.240> my<00:05:55.510> 20<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.080> got<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.230> 20<00:05:56.620> and

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
right of that is my 20 you got a 20 and

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.280 
right of that is my 20 you got a 20 and
you<00:05:56.830> have<00:05:56.950> that<00:05:57.100> set<00:05:57.400> up<00:05:57.550> with<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.450> double

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
you have that set up with the double

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
you have that set up with the double
pedal<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.780> that's<00:06:02.050> just<00:06:02.320> kinda<00:06:02.680> like<00:06:02.800> it's

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
pedal so that's just kinda like it's

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.100 
pedal so that's just kinda like it's
like<00:06:03.490> right<00:06:03.730> next<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:04.090> your<00:06:04.240> normal<00:06:04.600> bass<00:06:04.900> drum

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
like right next to your normal bass drum

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.820 
like right next to your normal bass drum
pedal<00:06:05.260> right<00:06:05.910> remote<00:06:06.910> side<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:08.230> that<00:06:08.470> I<00:06:08.620> guess

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
pedal right remote side is that I guess

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.590 
pedal right remote side is that I guess
just<00:06:09.280> for<00:06:09.400> another<00:06:09.670> different<00:06:10.240> tone<00:06:10.390> and

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
just for another different tone and

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.240 
just for another different tone and
there's<00:06:10.870> a<00:06:10.990> toll<00:06:11.230> and<00:06:11.590> then<00:06:11.830> on<00:06:11.950> your<00:06:12.070> main

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
there's a toll and then on your main

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.070 
there's a toll and then on your main
kick<00:06:12.520> in<00:06:12.730> front<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.330> kick<00:06:13.540> drum<00:06:13.780> you've

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
kick in front of the kick drum you've

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.310 
kick in front of the kick drum you've
got<00:06:14.320> like<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> resonator<00:06:15.940> cats<00:06:16.240> up<00:06:16.450> disaster

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
got like a resonator cats up disaster

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.430 
got like a resonator cats up disaster
resonator<00:06:18.040> we<00:06:18.370> thought<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.730> is<00:06:18.790> obstacles

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
resonator we thought this is obstacles

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.430 
resonator we thought this is obstacles
you<00:06:20.440> know<00:06:20.590> it's<00:06:20.980> great<00:06:21.250> if<00:06:21.400> you<00:06:21.790> can<00:06:21.820> use<00:06:22.150> it

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
you know it's great if you can use it

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:38.180 
you know it's great if you can use it
