00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.980 

let's<00:02:35.880> risk<00:02:36.150> things<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.830> risk

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
let's risk things because we like risk

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.900 
let's risk things because we like risk
this<00:02:39.990> pays<00:02:40.260> off<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.740> might<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.460> be<00:02:41.700> able<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this pays off we might just be able to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.710 
this pays off we might just be able to
get<00:02:42.030> around<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:46.790> me<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.270> more

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
get around this one so me now get more

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.620 
get around this one so me now get more
actress<00:02:49.080> shut<00:02:49.380> off<00:02:49.560> 25%<00:02:50.100> only

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.750 

all<00:02:53.840> right<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.170> let's<00:02:54.350> go<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.650> grenade<00:02:55.100> sauce

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.900 

start<00:02:58.760> using<00:02:59.150> some<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.390> their<00:02:59.510> color<00:03:06.910> so

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
start using some of their color so

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.360 
start using some of their color so
there's<00:03:08.090> nine<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.900> them<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:10.100> that's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
there's nine of them then I know that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.900 
there's nine of them then I know that's
just<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.610> nod<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.210> eight<00:03:11.360> possibly

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
just a nod to so that eight possibly
