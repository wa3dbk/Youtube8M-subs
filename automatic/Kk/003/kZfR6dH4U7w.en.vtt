conjunction with their helmets usually

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.050 
conjunction with their helmets usually
tend<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.110> make<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> pretty<00:01:08.590> nice<00:01:08.740> fit<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.250> any

wind leakage you might get in around the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.399 
wind leakage you might get in around the
sides<00:01:12.270> might<00:01:13.270> not<00:01:13.450> seem<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.750> important<00:01:14.290> to

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
sides might not seem that important to

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.350 
sides might not seem that important to
you<00:01:14.500> but<00:01:14.740> if<00:01:14.890> it's<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.159> really<00:01:15.460> cold<00:01:15.730> day<00:01:15.820> you're

when you look at it from the inside
you're<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.400> really<00:02:22.610> getting<00:02:22.819> very<00:02:23.150> much<00:02:23.300> more

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
you're not really getting very much more

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.600 
you're not really getting very much more

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
view than any other goggle it's just

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.400

that<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.819> lens<00:02:26.030> actually<00:02:26.330> covers<00:02:26.870> more<00:02:27.350> of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that the lens actually covers more of

that the lens actually covers more of
the<00:02:27.560> form<00:02:27.860> surface<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:29.750> did<00:02:29.900> try<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:30.110> climb

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the form surface we did try these climb

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.980 
the form surface we did try these climb
radius<00:02:30.860> goggles<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.760> figured<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.240> had<00:02:32.510> an

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
radius goggles but we figured we had an

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.660 
radius goggles but we figured we had an
early<00:02:33.380> model<00:02:33.620> because<00:02:34.040> these<00:02:34.220> lenses

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
early model because these lenses

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.490 
early model because these lenses
actually<00:02:34.819> fogged<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.750> between<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> lenses

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
actually fogged up in between the lenses

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.410 
actually fogged up in between the lenses
we<00:02:36.980> had<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.160> split<00:02:37.280> them<00:02:37.459> apart<00:02:37.520> dry<00:02:38.180> them<00:02:38.360> out

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
we had to split them apart dry them out

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.850 
we had to split them apart dry them out
with<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.600> hairdryer<00:02:39.020> then<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.620> were<00:02:39.680> back<00:02:39.830> on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
with a hairdryer then we were back on

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.199 
with a hairdryer then we were back on
the<00:02:40.100> trail<00:02:40.280> again<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.670> next<00:02:40.850> day<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.120> we

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the trail again the next day and we

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.460 
the trail again the next day and we
really<00:02:41.300> didn't<00:02:41.569> have<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> problem<00:02:42.080> after<00:02:42.200> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
really didn't have a problem after that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.229 
really didn't have a problem after that
we<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.040> went<00:02:43.160> around<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.580> squeezed<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.030> seal

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
we just went around we squeezed the seal

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.330 
we just went around we squeezed the seal
all<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.450> way<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.930> then<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:45.920> didn't<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.250> an

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
all the way and then we didn't have an

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220 
all the way and then we didn't have an
issue<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:46.940> we've<00:02:47.450> been<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.750> contact<00:02:47.959> with

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
issue but we've been in contact with

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.960 
issue but we've been in contact with
climb<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.800> they're<00:02:49.340> gonna<00:02:49.459> replace<00:02:49.760> these

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
climb and they're gonna replace these

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
climb and they're gonna replace these
lenses<00:02:50.330> for<00:02:50.540> us<00:02:50.660> because<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.989> think<00:02:51.170> maybe<00:02:51.500> they

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
lenses for us because I think maybe they

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
lenses for us because I think maybe they
had<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.800> bad<00:02:52.010> batch<00:02:52.360> very<00:02:53.360> well-constructed

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
had a bad batch very well-constructed

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560 
had a bad batch very well-constructed
