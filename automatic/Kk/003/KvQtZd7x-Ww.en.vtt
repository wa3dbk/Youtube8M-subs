00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.200 

barks<00:00:59.770> is<00:00:59.920> way<00:01:00.070> more<00:01:00.219> in<00:01:00.370> there

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
barks is way more in there

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.689 
barks is way more in there
alright<00:01:02.930> let's<00:01:03.290> hope<00:01:03.530> we're<00:01:03.829> near<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.220> now<00:01:04.369> I

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
alright let's hope we're near it now I

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.969 
alright let's hope we're near it now I
keep<00:01:05.449> thinking<00:01:05.510> we're<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.260> close<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.830> but

keep thinking we're so close to it but
then<00:01:07.070> we<00:01:07.159> end<00:01:07.280> up<00:01:07.369> not<00:01:07.520> being<00:01:07.760> anywhere<00:01:08.270> close

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
then we end up not being anywhere close

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:18.880
