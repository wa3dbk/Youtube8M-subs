hey guys welcome back to project Cummins

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.100 
hey guys welcome back to project Cummins
so<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> got<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.300> ask<00:00:09.390> the<00:00:09.600> question<00:00:09.930> the<00:00:10.020> other

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
day how do I know my block heaters

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.999 
day how do I know my block heaters
working<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.710> it's

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
working how do I know it's

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.089 
working how do I know it's
the<00:00:15.940> guys<00:00:16.119> said<00:00:16.539> or<00:00:16.930> he<00:00:17.050> told<00:00:17.289> me<00:00:17.439> at<00:00:17.560> least<00:00:17.680> he

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
the guys said or he told me at least he

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.760 
the guys said or he told me at least he
started<00:00:18.490> up<00:00:18.580> his<00:00:18.760> truck<00:00:19.170> after<00:00:20.170> leaving<00:00:20.590> I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
started up his truck after leaving I

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.220 
started up his truck after leaving I
plugged<00:00:21.009> in<00:00:21.189> for<00:00:21.430> about<00:00:21.580> two<00:00:21.820> hours<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.390> the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
plugged in for about two hours and the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.839 
plugged in for about two hours and the
needle<00:00:23.529> hadn't<00:00:23.890> moved<00:00:24.009> at<00:00:24.220> all<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.669> oil

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
needle hadn't moved at all the oil

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.529 
needle hadn't moved at all the oil
wasn't<00:00:25.150> very<00:00:25.449> hot<00:00:25.810> that<00:00:26.110> he<00:00:26.140> could<00:00:26.439> tell<00:00:26.680> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
wasn't very hot that he could tell and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.890 
wasn't very hot that he could tell and
it<00:00:28.539> didn't<00:00:28.869> start<00:00:29.050> up<00:00:29.199> any<00:00:29.380> easier<00:00:29.860> okay<00:00:30.550> so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it didn't start up any easier okay so

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.119 
it didn't start up any easier okay so
this<00:00:31.900> tells<00:00:32.199> me<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.619> we<00:00:32.710> need<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:32.920> go<00:00:33.100> over

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
this tells me that we need to go over

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.000 
this tells me that we need to go over
block<00:00:33.460> heaters<00:00:33.790> for<00:00:33.970> just<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.269> minute<00:00:34.420> here<00:00:34.750> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
block heaters for just a minute here a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.890 
block heaters for just a minute here a
block<00:00:36.010> heater<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.640> coil<00:00:36.970> about<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.570> size<00:00:37.780> of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
block heater is a coil about the size of

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.140 
block heater is a coil about the size of
my<00:00:37.960> palm<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:39.370> goes<00:00:39.519> in<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.820> side<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.030> your

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
my palm and it goes in the side of your

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.950 
my palm and it goes in the side of your
engine<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:41.530> where<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.769> oil<00:00:41.949> is<00:00:42.129> at<00:00:42.960> you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
engine and to where the oil is at you

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.790 
engine and to where the oil is at you
plug<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.379> into<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.680> wall<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:47.289> uses

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
plug it into the wall and it uses

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.430 
plug it into the wall and it uses
anywhere<00:00:48.430> from<00:00:48.670> 700<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.629> thousand<00:00:50.260> maybe

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
anywhere from 700 to a thousand maybe

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.020 
anywhere from 700 to a thousand maybe
sometimes<00:00:51.039> even<00:00:51.340> more<00:00:51.460> depending<00:00:51.789> on<00:00:51.850> how

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
sometimes even more depending on how

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.740 
sometimes even more depending on how
cold<00:00:52.780> your<00:00:53.020> region<00:00:53.289> is<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.680> watts<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:55.390> heat<00:00:55.600> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
cold your region is of watts to heat the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.119 
cold your region is of watts to heat the
oil<00:00:55.780> within<00:00:56.170> your<00:00:56.410> engine<00:00:56.710> while<00:00:56.859> it's<00:00:57.010> not

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
oil within your engine while it's not

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.319 
oil within your engine while it's not
running<00:00:57.840> okay<00:00:59.430> before<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:00.760> get<00:01:00.850> into<00:01:01.149> how<00:01:01.300> to

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
running okay before we get into how to

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.660 
running okay before we get into how to
how<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:01.750> we<00:01:01.870> know<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.320> working<00:01:02.609> why<00:01:03.609> do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
how do we know that it's working why do

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.770 
how do we know that it's working why do
we<00:01:03.969> have<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.500> why<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.860> have<00:01:06.070> lock<00:01:06.340> heaters

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
we have this why do we have lock heaters

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.029 
we have this why do we have lock heaters
because<00:01:07.780> when<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.200> get<00:01:08.320> in<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.500> truck

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
because when you get in the truck

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.240 
because when you get in the truck
you<00:01:09.820> can<00:01:10.000> turn<00:01:10.149> your<00:01:10.330> key<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.250> accessory

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
you can turn your key to the accessory

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.389 
you can turn your key to the accessory
and<00:01:12.539> then<00:01:13.539> your<00:01:14.440> glow<00:01:14.619> plugs<00:01:14.920> heat<00:01:15.160> up<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
and then your glow plugs heat up the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.389 
and then your glow plugs heat up the
truck<00:01:15.720> well<00:01:16.720> that's<00:01:17.140> apples<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.009> oranges

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
truck well that's apples and oranges

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.699 
truck well that's apples and oranges
really<00:01:18.759> because<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.509> glow<00:01:19.990> plugs<00:01:20.410> are

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
really because the glow plugs are

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.650 
really because the glow plugs are
heating<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.369> air<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.090> ambient<00:01:22.509> air

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
heating up the air the ambient air

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.850 
heating up the air the ambient air
around<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.530> piston<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.860> thermodynamics

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
around the piston so that thermodynamics

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.260 
around the piston so that thermodynamics
can<00:01:26.979> kick<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.399> when<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.729> start<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.060> crank

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
can kick in when you start the crank

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.499 
can kick in when you start the crank
over<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.599> engine<00:01:28.959> and<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.819> heat<00:01:30.819> up<00:01:30.849> the<00:01:31.149> fuel

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
over the engine and can heat up the fuel

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.889 
over the engine and can heat up the fuel
and<00:01:31.660> air<00:01:31.780> mixture<00:01:31.929> enough<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:32.670> explodes<00:01:33.899> so

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
and air mixture enough to explodes so

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.389 
and air mixture enough to explodes so
we're<00:01:35.080> talking<00:01:35.229> apples<00:01:35.709> and<00:01:35.860> oranges<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.310> at

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
we're talking apples and oranges here at

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.870 
we're talking apples and oranges here at
the<00:01:36.489> minute<00:01:36.729> this<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:37.989> block<00:01:38.289> heater<00:01:38.880> heats

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the minute this this block heater heats

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.339 
the minute this this block heater heats
up<00:01:40.119> your<00:01:40.330> oil<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:42.009> entire<00:01:42.310> engine<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.899> to

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
up your oil and the entire engine now to

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.540 
up your oil and the entire engine now to
do<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.929> makes<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.110> lot<00:01:47.289> easier<00:01:47.800> on<00:01:48.160> your

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
do that it makes a lot easier on your

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.660 
do that it makes a lot easier on your
engine<00:01:48.959> so<00:01:49.959> plugging<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:50.890> for<00:01:51.130> two<00:01:51.310> hours

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670

question what you need to do is go and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.380 
question what you need to do is go and
find<00:02:50.140> your<00:02:50.710> electric<00:02:51.370> meter<00:02:51.550> reader<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
find your electric meter reader for the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.430 
find your electric meter reader for the
house<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.860> need<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.190> look<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.640> here<00:02:55.440> for

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
house and you need to look in here for

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.990 
house and you need to look in here for
that<00:02:56.560> spinning<00:02:56.980> disk<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.370> see<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.640> this

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
that spinning disk you see that this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.530 
that spinning disk you see that this
spinning<00:02:58.980> okay<00:02:59.980> what<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.060> need<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.420> is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
spinning okay what you need to do is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.050 
spinning okay what you need to do is
memorize<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.530> rates<00:03:02.860> or<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.370> speed

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
memorize the kind of rates or the speed

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.949 
memorize the kind of rates or the speed
at<00:03:04.090> which<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.600> rotates<00:03:04.990> right<00:03:05.620> now<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.959> go

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
at which it rotates right now then go

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.710 
at which it rotates right now then go
back<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.800> plug<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.430> truck<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.940> we'll

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
back and plug in your truck and we'll

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.180 
back and plug in your truck and we'll
see<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.020> some<00:03:11.290> time<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.500> plug<00:03:11.770> in<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> truck

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
see you some time to plug in the truck

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.670 
see you some time to plug in the truck
and<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:12.760> what<00:03:12.880> goes<00:03:13.300> on<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.500> I'm

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
and see just what goes on for this I'm

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.330 
and see just what goes on for this I'm
using<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:15.160> lot<00:03:15.490> heavier<00:03:16.180> duty<00:03:16.630> cord<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.830> can't

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
using a lot heavier duty cord I can't

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.250 
using a lot heavier duty cord I can't
remember<00:03:18.459> exactly<00:03:18.580> what<00:03:19.060> gauge<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.630> but

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
remember exactly what gauge it is but

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.990 
remember exactly what gauge it is but
the<00:03:20.320> reason<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.650> bought<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.830> heavier<00:03:21.160> Duty<00:03:21.370> r1<00:03:21.820> is

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
the reason I bought a heavier Duty r1 is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060 
the reason I bought a heavier Duty r1 is
because<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.780> will<00:03:22.990> draw<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> lot<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.590> amperage

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
because this will draw a lot of amperage

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.140 
because this will draw a lot of amperage
and<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:25.000> light<00:03:25.900> duty<00:03:26.350> orange<00:03:26.709> ones<00:03:27.150> really

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and the light duty orange ones really

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.110 
and the light duty orange ones really
are<00:03:28.360> not<00:03:28.450> made<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:28.930> high<00:03:29.110> amperage<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.660> yeah

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
are not made for high amperage so yeah

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.229 
are not made for high amperage so yeah
go<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.410> go<00:03:35.640> alright<00:03:36.640> now<00:03:37.000> we<00:03:37.060> got

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
go in there you go alright now we got

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.509 
go in there you go alright now we got
the<00:03:37.360> truck<00:03:37.570> plugged<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:38.050> we<00:03:38.620> can<00:03:38.739> go<00:03:38.920> back<00:03:39.220> to

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
the truck plugged in we can go back to

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.150 
the truck plugged in we can go back to
the<00:03:39.700> meter<00:03:39.970> reading<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.560> how<00:03:41.680> that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
the meter reading and see just how that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.560 
the meter reading and see just how that
wheel<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.489> turning<00:03:42.700> remember<00:03:43.120> how<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.390> was

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
wheel is turning remember how it was

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.449 
wheel is turning remember how it was
before<00:03:43.780> let's<00:03:44.350> take<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> look<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.190> here<00:03:47.459> wait

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
before let's take a look in here wait

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.780 
before let's take a look in here wait
for<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.850> bar<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.600> come<00:03:49.780> by<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.459> can

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
for that bar to come by now I can

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.610 
for that bar to come by now I can
already<00:03:51.940> tell<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.269> is<00:03:52.570> spinning<00:03:52.959> much

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
already tell this is spinning much

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.880 
already tell this is spinning much
faster<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.690> for<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.140> better<00:03:56.290> understand

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
faster but for you to better understand

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.500 
faster but for you to better understand
we'll<00:03:57.220> wait<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.580> bar<00:03:57.790> comes<00:03:58.000> by<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.420> see

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
we'll wait to the bar comes by and see

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:10.470 
we'll wait to the bar comes by and see
how<00:03:58.660> fast<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:59.110> just<00:03:59.170> whiz<00:03:59.620> by<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.010> thing<00:04:09.480> okay

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
how fast it just whiz by this thing okay

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.300 
how fast it just whiz by this thing okay
no<00:04:10.660> it's<00:04:10.900> not<00:04:10.989> that<00:04:11.320> fast<00:04:11.680> but<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:12.130> can

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
no it's not that fast but you can

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.490 
no it's not that fast but you can
definitely<00:04:12.850> tell<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.660> by<00:04:13.690> looking<00:04:13.780> at<00:04:14.320> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
definitely tell just by looking at it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.250 
definitely tell just by looking at it
it's<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.250> lot<00:04:15.489> faster<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.180> it's<00:04:16.330> drawing<00:04:16.660> much

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
it's a lot faster so it's drawing much

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.469 
it's a lot faster so it's drawing much
more<00:04:17.650> electricity<00:04:18.400> out<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.060> household

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
more electricity out of your household

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.360 
more electricity out of your household
now<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.470> it's<00:04:20.590> drawing<00:04:20.859> all<00:04:21.220> the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
now that it's drawing all the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.950 
now that it's drawing all the
electricity<00:04:21.820> or<00:04:21.940> household<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.810> be

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
electricity or household you can be

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.560 
electricity or household you can be
certain<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.880> electricity<00:04:25.390> is<00:04:25.450> going

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
certain that the electricity is going

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.960 
certain that the electricity is going
into<00:04:26.440> your<00:04:26.560> oil<00:04:26.740> heated<00:04:27.280> up<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.520> heat<00:04:27.700> up<00:04:27.729> that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
into your oil heated up to heat up that

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.040 
into your oil heated up to heat up that
coil<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.740> said<00:04:29.950> before<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.450> want<00:04:31.479> to<00:04:31.840> use

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
coil like I said before you want to use

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.600 
coil like I said before you want to use
this<00:04:32.200> six<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.650> eight<00:04:32.770> hours<00:04:33.130> before<00:04:33.340> you

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
this six to eight hours before you

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.170 
this six to eight hours before you
intend<00:04:33.910> on<00:04:34.030> driving<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.419> truck<00:04:35.880> now<00:04:36.880> why<00:04:37.030> do<00:04:37.090> I

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
intend on driving the truck now why do I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.360 
intend on driving the truck now why do I
say<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.690> well<00:04:38.320> because<00:04:38.349> in<00:04:38.860> my<00:04:38.979> easel

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
say that well because in my easel

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.300 
say that well because in my easel
electricity

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
electricity

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.510 
electricity
but<00:04:40.970> it's<00:04:41.120> not<00:04:41.330> very<00:04:41.480> efficient<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:43.010> plug

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
but it's not very efficient the plug

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.520 
but it's not very efficient the plug
heaters<00:04:44.090> are<00:04:44.300> really<00:04:44.570> nice<00:04:44.750> they're<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.290> not

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
heaters are really nice they're just not

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.890 
heaters are really nice they're just not
very<00:04:45.590> efficient<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:48.640> yeah<00:04:49.640> another<00:04:50.630> way<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
very efficient so yeah another way you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.200 
very efficient so yeah another way you
could<00:04:51.110> do<00:04:51.290> this<00:04:51.500> is<00:04:51.770> if<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.940> one<00:04:53.180> of

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
could do this is if you have one of

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.240 
could do this is if you have one of
those<00:04:53.360> meters<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.140> could<00:04:54.380> plug<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:54.980> and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
those meters that you could plug in and

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.190 
those meters that you could plug in and
it<00:04:55.580> can<00:04:55.700> tell<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.240> exact<00:04:56.630> wattage<00:04:57.170> that

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
it can tell you the exact wattage that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.440 
it can tell you the exact wattage that
you're<00:04:57.530> reading<00:04:57.890> but<00:04:58.700> why<00:04:58.910> waste<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.360> money

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
you're reading but why waste the money

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.940 
you're reading but why waste the money
and<00:04:59.780> buy<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.140> when<00:05:00.290> you<00:05:00.410> can<00:05:00.500> just<00:05:00.650> go<00:05:00.830> in

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
and buy that when you can just go in

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.470 
and buy that when you can just go in
your<00:05:01.070> house<00:05:01.220> or<00:05:01.520> outside<00:05:02.060> your<00:05:02.180> house<00:05:02.330> or

your house or outside your house or

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.720 
your house or outside your house or
wherever<00:05:02.570> your<00:05:02.900> meter<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.770> at<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.340> look

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
wherever your meter is at and just look

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.290 
wherever your meter is at and just look
and<00:05:05.030> see<00:05:05.420> for<00:05:05.450> yourself<00:05:05.930> if<00:05:06.170> more<00:05:07.300> electricity

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
and see for yourself if more electricity

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.260 
and see for yourself if more electricity
is<00:05:08.360> being<00:05:08.570> used<00:05:08.870> or<00:05:09.140> not<00:05:09.790> so<00:05:10.790> save<00:05:11.150> yourself

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
is being used or not so save yourself

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.210 
is being used or not so save yourself
some<00:05:11.600> money<00:05:11.810> make<00:05:12.140> sure<00:05:12.320> that's<00:05:12.500> working<00:05:12.770> and

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
you want to make sure that it's working

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.630 
you want to make sure that it's working
before<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.230> winter<00:05:15.410> comes<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:16.340> know<00:05:16.460> for

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
before the winter comes you know for

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.460 
before the winter comes you know for
people<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.030> use<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.230> go<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
people that use it you can go to the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.110 
people that use it you can go to the
whole<00:05:18.710> winter<00:05:19.010> as<00:05:19.340> long<00:05:19.550> as<00:05:19.670> your<00:05:19.790> batteries

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
whole winter as long as your batteries

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.450 
whole winter as long as your batteries
are<00:05:20.150> good<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:21.110> can<00:05:21.140> go<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.470> whole<00:05:21.500> winter<00:05:21.890> and

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460

are good you can go the whole winter and
never<00:05:22.880> have<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.180> use<00:05:23.450> another<00:05:23.600> question<00:05:24.260> was

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
never have to use another question was

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.460 
never have to use another question was
is<00:05:24.710> how<00:05:24.890> do<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:25.070> make<00:05:25.310> sure<00:05:26.140> that<00:05:27.140> it's<00:05:27.320> getting

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
is how do I make sure that it's getting

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.990 
is how do I make sure that it's getting
the<00:05:27.980> eight<00:05:28.190> hours<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:30.370> no<00:05:31.370> more<00:05:31.640> or<00:05:31.850> no<00:05:31.970> less

the eight hours and no more or no less

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.800 
the eight hours and no more or no less
because<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.720> thousand<00:05:33.470> watts<00:05:33.680> or<00:05:33.920> more<00:05:34.570> an<00:05:35.570> hour

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
because a thousand watts or more an hour

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.850 
because a thousand watts or more an hour
is<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:37.340> lot<00:05:37.670> of<00:05:37.850> money<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.410> mean<00:05:39.410> depending<00:05:39.770> on

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
is a lot of money I mean depending on

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.770 
is a lot of money I mean depending on
where<00:05:40.040> you<00:05:40.190> live<00:05:40.430> some<00:05:40.790> places<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.240> have<00:05:41.420> you

where you live some places that have you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.840 
where you live some places that have you
know<00:05:41.810> 12<00:05:42.200> cents<00:05:42.470> kilowatt<00:05:42.920> you<00:05:43.550> know<00:05:43.670> that

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
know 12 cents kilowatt you know that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.970 
know 12 cents kilowatt you know that
could<00:05:44.000> add<00:05:44.810> up<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:45.080> a<00:05:45.260> lot<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.470> money<00:05:45.650> at<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
could add up to a lot of money at the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.710 
could add up to a lot of money at the
end<00:05:46.070> of<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.250> month<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.640> at<00:05:46.790> the<00:05:47.420> end<00:05:47.570> of<00:05:47.660> the

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
end of the month and at the end of the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.190 
end of the month and at the end of the
winter<00:05:48.190> it's<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.220> nice<00:05:49.370> whole<00:05:49.550> chunk<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.880> change

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
winter it's a nice whole chunk of change

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.270 
winter it's a nice whole chunk of change
so<00:05:51.200> how<00:05:51.350> do<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.500> make<00:05:51.620> sure<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:51.950> you're<00:05:52.130> not

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
so how do you make sure that you're not

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.980 
so how do you make sure that you're not
using<00:05:52.490> any<00:05:52.730> more<00:05:52.850> electricity<00:05:53.270> than<00:05:53.450> you<00:05:53.750> need

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
using any more electricity than you need

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.670 
using any more electricity than you need
to<00:05:54.230> to<00:05:54.350> get<00:05:54.470> your<00:05:54.620> engine<00:05:54.920> warm<00:05:55.450> well<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:57.470> put

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
to to get your engine warm well you put
