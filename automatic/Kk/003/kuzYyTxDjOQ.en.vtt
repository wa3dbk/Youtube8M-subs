is<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.890> until<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.460> actually

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
is a lot of time until I actually

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.700 
is a lot of time until I actually
started<00:01:05.939> doing<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.000 

okay<00:01:15.400> don't<00:01:15.850> really<00:01:16.120> have<00:01:16.240> time<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:17.010> perfect

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010

anything

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:44.550 

and<00:01:34.900> we're<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:35.710> halfway<00:01:36.040> through

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.789 

this<00:01:45.549> looks<00:01:45.790> pretty<00:01:46.030> bad<00:01:49.590> eyelash<00:01:50.590> curler<00:01:51.460> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:04.340 
cannot walk out of the house without
having<00:01:55.450> my<00:01:55.720> eyelashes<00:01:56.259> girls<00:01:56.530> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:23.380 

Scarah<00:02:06.720> wait<00:02:07.720> 30<00:02:08.080> seconds<00:02:08.560> left

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:45.520 

how<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.810> gonna<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:44.090> guess<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.269> done

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
how I'm gonna do this I guess I'm done

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
how I'm gonna do this I guess I'm done
so<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:47.159> only<00:02:47.310> had<00:02:47.519> two<00:02:47.819> minutes<00:02:48.000> this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
so because I only had two minutes this

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
so because I only had two minutes this
is<00:02:48.719> the<00:02:48.780> look<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.709> had<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.549> very

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is the look that I had it's just very

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110 
is the look that I had it's just very
natural<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.889> obviously<00:02:52.889> pretty<00:02:53.280> rushed<00:02:53.639> but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
natural and obviously pretty rushed but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.270 
natural and obviously pretty rushed but
if<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.599> had<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:54.959> more<00:02:55.109> time<00:02:55.169> I<00:02:55.379> probably<00:02:55.829> would

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
if I had some more time I probably would

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.179 
if I had some more time I probably would
have<00:02:56.370> added<00:02:56.549> some<00:02:56.970> eyeliner<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.709> powder

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
have added some eyeliner and some powder

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.170 
have added some eyeliner and some powder
if<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.139> do<00:03:01.139> end<00:03:01.409> up<00:03:01.530> doing<00:03:01.919> a<00:03:01.950> look<00:03:02.519> like<00:03:02.909> this

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
if you do end up doing a look like this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.640 
if you do end up doing a look like this
or<00:03:03.450> you're<00:03:03.599> being<00:03:03.780> rushed<00:03:04.019> out<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.230> door<00:03:04.319> I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
or you're being rushed out the door I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.099 
or you're being rushed out the door I
would<00:03:05.489> suggest<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:06.269> least<00:03:06.329> putting<00:03:06.659> on<00:03:06.840> some

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
would suggest at least putting on some

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.559 
would suggest at least putting on some
powder<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.730> avoid<00:03:08.849> shine

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
powder so that you avoid shine

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.500 
powder so that you avoid shine
throughout<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.319> day<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.730> only<00:03:12.180> had<00:03:12.329> two

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
throughout the day but I only had two

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.780 
throughout the day but I only had two
minutes<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.590> worked<00:03:13.829> with<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.340> time<00:03:14.519> that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
minutes and I worked with the time that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240 
minutes and I worked with the time that
I<00:03:14.819> had<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.419> feel<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.469> this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.769> kind<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.159> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
I had I feel like this is kind of a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.589 
I had I feel like this is kind of a
useful<00:03:17.519> tag<00:03:17.969> as<00:03:18.209> well<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> fun<00:03:19.169> tag<00:03:19.950> because

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
useful tag as well as a fun tag because

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.539 
useful tag as well as a fun tag because
