00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.610
 ah 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.650
 what is the amazonian tropical forest 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.829
 the forests constitute one of the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.449
 most valuable ecosystems in the world 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.710
 contain more than 60% of the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.710
 biodiversity of the planet 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.510
 that in addition to its intrinsic value has 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 other multiple social values ​​and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.350
 economic from the important 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 ecological functions of the forest in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.809
 terms of soil protection and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.879
 the basins up to the economic value 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 pecuniary and non - pecuniary of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.239
 numerous products that can be extracted 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.239
 forest 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 Peru is the second country with the highest 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.520
 extension of forests in Latin America and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 the ninth in the world that is to say owns more 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.580
 60% of the territory with vocation 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 forestry is also known as a country 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.570
 forestry forest wealth of Peru to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.160
 just like many other parts of the world 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.800
 it has a profound lag when it 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.960
 compares its ecological value with its contribution 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.660
 to the economy and this also gets 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 evidence when a review of 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.369
 the way the resource is administered 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.300
 in the last four decades and that have 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.009
 led to create greater resentment and 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.430
 distrust of the rural population that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.520
 live from the resource 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.090
 the Amazonian forests are a system 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.680
 very important for the life of the planet 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.150
 they house a lot of resources 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.420
 ranging from very large trees lianas 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 herbaceous shrub fauna and microfauna 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.259
 tropical forests provide 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.890
 millions of people 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.530
 raw material in the form of food 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.720
 fuel building materials and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 they provide ecological services that are 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.750
 vital for all inhabitants of the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 planet such as water regulation 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.370
 erosion control and fixing 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.860
 carbon 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.840
 in recent years due to various 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.150
 anthropic activities that find 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.659
 its roots in a complex of realities 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.360
 social environmental policies and 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.900
 institutions is producing a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.280
 accelerated process of deforestation 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 causing the change of use and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.799
 forest degradation that threatens 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.829
 biodiversity and releases gases from 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.840
 greenhouse effect favoring 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.840
 increase in global climate change 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.160
 this negative situation was noticed in 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.650
 the fourth evaluation report of 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.140
 intergovernmental panel on change 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.480
 climatic that presented evidence 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.360
 incontrovertible in the sense that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.790
 the global climate is changing due 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 mainly to human activities 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.530
 Peru has a forest reserve of 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.710
 more than 78 million hectares of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.810
 natural forests becoming a 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.810
 important potential to sustain the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.170
 sustainable development of the country of 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.580
 which more than 74 million are 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.580
 in the jungle region 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.690
 tropical forests give us the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 following benefits first 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.420
 the companies contribute the resources 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.890
 of different degrees according to the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.640
 level of development of it 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.330
 among them we have hardwoods 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.090
 raw material for wood industries 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.920
 for construction wood pulp 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.350
 for paper making paints 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.760
 textile materials materials for 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:30.910
 chemical products medicines and so on 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:34.590
 gums resins oils fruits fuel 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.590
 firewood and charcoal 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.550
 as a second benefit is 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.930
 among them the genetic reserve 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.640
 important in the world 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.730
 contribute to the biosphere in their 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.300
 Basic processes capture solar energy 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.240
 and joining it to the nutrients that its 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.270
 vegetation by its roots transform it 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.670
 in organic matter and perform the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.540
 recycling around the carbon planet 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.440
 nitrogen and oxygen that's why they are 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.080
 consider the lungs of the planet 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.700
 they influence the elements of climate 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.030
 regulates the temperature with its shadow 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.180
 decrease the ground temperature and 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.160
 favor rainfall more than half 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.480
 of the rainfall are returned to 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.260
 the atmosphere by 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.260
 evapotranspiration 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.840
 the amazonian forest for example is the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.080
 greater concentration of forest 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.780
 world could be said to be one of the 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.440
 lungs of the planet that more oxygen 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.280
 expelled and what else has been and is 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.280
 keep destroying 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.259
 and as a third benefit they avoid processes 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.259
 erosive 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.170
 their glasses intercept the rains and 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.170
 soften its impact on the ground 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.180
 to this effect it is called effect 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.470
 sponge its roots interweave on the ground 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.470
 and holds it 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.020
 All this 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.180
 no no 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.750
 do not 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.850
 peru progress for all
