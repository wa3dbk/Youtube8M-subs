hey<00:00:00.240> Steve<00:00:00.659> Fisher<00:00:01.260> California<00:00:01.800> trying<00:00:02.010> to

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey Steve Fisher California trying to

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.770 
hey Steve Fisher California trying to
talk<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.550> them<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:02.760> speed<00:00:03.240> out<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.570> bar

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
talk to them about speed out of the bar

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.360 
talk to them about speed out of the bar
in<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.259> Queen<00:00:04.529> so<00:00:04.799> how<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> transition

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
in the Queen so how to transition

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.070 
in the Queen so how to transition
quickly<00:00:05.700> into<00:00:06.120> Mars<00:00:06.330> where<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.690> questions

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
quickly into Mars where the questions

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.400 
quickly into Mars where the questions
are<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.379> get<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> lot<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:09.110> we're<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> talk

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
are we get a lot so we're going to talk

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.860 
are we get a lot so we're going to talk
about<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.340> couple<00:00:12.059> exercises<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.840> can

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
about is a couple exercises that you can

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.330 
about is a couple exercises that you can
do<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.139> improve<00:00:13.259> speed<00:00:13.679> under<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.950> bar<00:00:14.099> but

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
do to improve speed under the bar but

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.320 
do to improve speed under the bar but
really<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.849> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> think<00:00:15.179> about

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
really what you want to think about

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
really what you want to think about
while<00:00:16.320> you're<00:00:16.740> trying<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.340> move<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:18.000> more

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
while you're trying to move with more

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.050 
while you're trying to move with more
speed<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.109> first<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.160> speed<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> generated

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
speed so first of all speed is generated

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.349 
speed so first of all speed is generated
under<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> bar<00:00:21.890> primarily<00:00:22.890> through

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
under the bar primarily through

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.269 
under the bar primarily through
executing<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.630> pole<00:00:24.930> correctly<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
executing the top pole correctly so the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.740 
executing the top pole correctly so the
reverse<00:00:26.519> threat<00:00:26.820> shortening<00:00:27.180> cycle<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.689> we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
reverse threat shortening cycle that we

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.019 
reverse threat shortening cycle that we
get<00:00:27.900> through<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> hip<00:00:28.320> flexor<00:00:28.740> combined<00:00:29.730> with

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
get through the hip flexor combined with

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
get through the hip flexor combined with
the<00:00:30.480> active<00:00:30.990> armhole<00:00:31.560> underneath<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> bar<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the active armhole underneath the bar is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
the active armhole underneath the bar is
where<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> speed<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.780> generated

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
where the speed is going to be generated

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.229 
where the speed is going to be generated
so<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> best<00:00:35.309> ways<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so one of the best ways to do that is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
so one of the best ways to do that is
just<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.840> start<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> carceral<00:00:37.800> range

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
just to start from the carceral range

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
just to start from the carceral range
movement<00:00:38.520> at<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.450> hip<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.260> call

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
movement at the hip what we call

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.520 
movement at the hip what we call
position<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> power<00:00:42.809> position

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
position one so from the power position

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.270 
position one so from the power position
jumping<00:00:44.129> catch<00:00:45.469> what<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.559> want<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> achieve<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
jumping catch what we want to achieve is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
jumping catch what we want to achieve is
the<00:00:47.309> feet<00:00:47.640> come<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.390> exact<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.870> time

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the feet come down the exact same time

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.350 
the feet come down the exact same time
the<00:00:49.320> elbows<00:00:49.620> complete<00:00:49.950> their<00:00:50.100> rotation<00:00:50.610> hips

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the elbows complete their rotation hips

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
the elbows complete their rotation hips
come<00:00:51.629> through<00:00:51.899> through<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> top<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> pole

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
come through through the top of the pole

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.830 
come through through the top of the pole
its<00:00:54.270> retreat<00:00:56.030> another<00:00:57.030> great<00:00:57.300> exercise<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
its retreat another great exercise that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.090 
its retreat another great exercise that
you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> improve<00:00:58.440> speed<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> bar

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
you can do to improve speed in the bar

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
you can do to improve speed in the bar
is<00:00:59.579> start<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.780> static<00:01:01.260> position<00:01:01.770> off

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
is start from a static position off

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.810 
is start from a static position off
blocks<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:04.260> particularly<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.549> start

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
blocks so I like particularly to start

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
blocks so I like particularly to start
with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> bar<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> knees<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.950> below

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
with the bar at the knees or just below

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.460 
with the bar at the knees or just below
the<00:01:08.430> knees<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> athlete

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the knees so that we can get the athlete

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
the knees so that we can get the athlete
in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> position<00:01:11.130> where<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.430> feel<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
in the position where they feel a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.380 
in the position where they feel a
stretch<00:01:12.630> reflex<00:01:13.490> starting<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.610> develop<00:01:14.760> or

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
stretch reflex starting to develop or

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
stretch reflex starting to develop or
stretch<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:15.869> their<00:01:16.049> hamstrings<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
stretch through their hamstrings so that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
stretch through their hamstrings so that
stretch<00:01:17.430> reflex<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.119> develop<00:01:18.509> through

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
stretch reflex that we develop through

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
stretch reflex that we develop through
the<00:01:19.290> pull<00:01:19.650> allows<00:01:20.430> us<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.360> accelerate<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> bar

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the pull allows us to accelerate the bar

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
the pull allows us to accelerate the bar
into<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> power<00:01:22.470> position<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.820> all

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
into the power position so from here all

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
into the power position so from here all
Rob's<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.689> about<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.049> pulling

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
Rob's going to think about is pulling

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.120 
Rob's going to think about is pulling
his<00:01:25.470> chest<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> power<00:01:26.520> position<00:01:28.130> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
his chest up into the power position and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.170 
his chest up into the power position and
moving<00:01:29.369> through<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> top<00:01:30.689> cushion

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
moving through the top cushion

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
moving through the top cushion
under<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> bar<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:34.079> speed<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.560> can

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
under the bar much speed as he can

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
under the bar much speed as he can
generate<00:01:34.979> again<00:01:35.430> feet<00:01:35.909> come<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> same

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
generate again feet come down the same

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
generate again feet come down the same
time<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> elbows<00:01:37.409> complete<00:01:37.740> their

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
time that the elbows complete their

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
time that the elbows complete their
rotation<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> static<00:01:39.329> start<00:01:39.780> he's<00:01:40.590> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
rotation from a static start he's just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.080 
rotation from a static start he's just
going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> pull<00:01:41.070> his<00:01:41.159> chest<00:01:41.369> up

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.850 

keep<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> accelerating<00:01:45.689> under<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> bar<00:01:46.140> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
keep you accelerating under the bar just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.200 
keep you accelerating under the bar just
to<00:01:47.009> extend<00:01:47.369> through<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> top<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> the
