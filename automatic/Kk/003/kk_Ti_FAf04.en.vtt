00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.480
 Good afternoon, how are you? 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.469
 I bought a rhizome-style rearview mirror with 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.469
 You can come here. 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.150
 I was breaking my head like 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.730
 Mount 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.410
 so mine and missing some screws 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 as you can see three types of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.420
 screw one each gauge and two 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.270
 shape boys I was breaking the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.500
 head like mount and motorcycle rear view mirror 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 as my family doubt can be 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.480
 someone doubt anyone else well 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:55.800
 rear view mirror is the simple side as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 can see the sport is like the screw 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 I did not know how it was done after 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 to search the Internet for what was 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.079
 the spindle 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.450
 So, how do we do it? 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.450
 this part of the support 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:20.020
 puts along with the cell phone is complicated 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.730
 we put it here we think it's going to stay 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730
 like this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:43.260
 Okay, we'll get you to the kitchen. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:47.280
 this little one misses this piece 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:54.990
 here to fix the screw that places 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:57.560
 here to give the finish also looks 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 how they stand 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.430
 Are not you here waiting for a boy? 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.810
 here are the three malls besides we use 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.810
 one to tighten the screw in place 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.330
 when you can see it stays like this 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.880
 right has this cover up here this 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 cover that we take as I'm going to take 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:58.769
 now the cops are here 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.849
 now who enters the screw that lacks a 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.849
 missing screw 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:21.909
 is placed here on the top so 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.269
 and this bottom to do is going to be 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.180
 screwed onto the bike and screwed and 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.370
 then the cap is placed on top 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.780
 How much longer is a screw than my head? 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.170
 I'm going to have to get a screw in 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 box or have tea or tea ready 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.190
 it's simple to assemble 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.170
 if you have not missed some simple pieces right 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.560
 galley earned thanks for attention with the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.560
 arm
