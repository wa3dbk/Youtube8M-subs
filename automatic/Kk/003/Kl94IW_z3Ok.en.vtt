00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
way to print a lot so I found this this

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.750 
way to print a lot so I found this this
is<00:00:35.130> called<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.520> continuous<00:00:36.000> ink<00:00:36.660> system<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
is called a continuous ink system the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040 
is called a continuous ink system the
way<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:38.969> works<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.719> these

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
way it works is you have these

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
way it works is you have these
reservoirs<00:00:41.329> of<00:00:42.329> course<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.780> your

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
reservoirs of course you got your

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.400 
reservoirs of course you got your
magenta<00:00:43.530> black<00:00:44.629> yellow<00:00:45.629> black<00:00:46.260> cyan<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
magenta black yellow black cyan and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.439 
magenta black yellow black cyan and
instead<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> having<00:00:49.710> ink<00:00:50.039> tanks<00:00:50.579> inside<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
instead of having ink tanks inside your

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.799 
instead of having ink tanks inside your
printer<00:00:51.890> these<00:00:52.890> reservoirs<00:00:53.340> hooked<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.030> with

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
printer these reservoirs hooked up with

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.319 
printer these reservoirs hooked up with
these<00:00:55.079> leads<00:00:56.149> these<00:00:57.149> lines<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.230> into

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
these leads these lines that go into

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.349 
these leads these lines that go into
these<00:01:00.329> fake<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:01.109> cartridges<00:01:02.090> inside<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
these fake little cartridges inside the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.510 
these fake little cartridges inside the
printer<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:05.390> when<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> print<00:01:06.780> something<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
printer and when you print something it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
printer and when you print something it
of<00:01:08.520> course<00:01:08.760> goes<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> way

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of course goes from there all the way

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.969 
of course goes from there all the way
over<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:15.979> good
