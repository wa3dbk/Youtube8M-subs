00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.540 
you're going to call everything I and
it's<00:00:27.000> running<00:00:27.270> much<00:00:28.010> slower<00:00:29.010> than<00:00:29.310> usual

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's running much slower than usual

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.340

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
will be very very fast going around but
