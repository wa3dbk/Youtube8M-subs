for picture and they could measure

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140 
for picture and they could measure
things<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> very<00:02:23.430> cumbersome

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

didn't actually matter much

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.979 
didn't actually matter much
it<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.870> end

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
it was just what you did at the end

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.590 
it was just what you did at the end
after<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.280> had<00:02:32.489> something<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.000> sounded

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
after you had something that sounded

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.440 
after you had something that sounded
good<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> intended<00:02:35.040> purpose<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:36.239> they

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
good for the intended purpose so they

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.920 
good for the intended purpose so they
would<00:02:36.660> listen<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.890> guitar<00:02:38.310> voice<00:02:38.930> with

flute<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.590> piano<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.459> they'd<00:02:42.269> get<00:02:42.480> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
flute and piano and they'd get a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.360 
flute and piano and they'd get a
microphone<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.470> point<00:02:43.709> where<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.040> liked

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
microphone to the point where they liked

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
microphone to the point where they liked
how<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.760> sounded<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.080> they'd<00:02:46.260> take<00:02:46.530> off

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
how it sounded and then they'd take off

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
how it sounded and then they'd take off
from<00:02:47.580> Princeton<00:02:48.090> labs<00:02:48.620> up<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.070> hour<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
from Princeton labs up the hour on the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.800 
from Princeton labs up the hour on the
train<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:52.110> New<00:02:53.010> York<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.519> put<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.360> up<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.660> front

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
train to New York and put it up in front

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.110 
train to New York and put it up in front
of<00:02:55.019> symphony<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> air<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.160> when<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of symphony of the air and when it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.660 
of symphony of the air and when it
sounded<00:02:57.570> good<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.140> those<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:59.070> microphone

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
sounded good on all those one microphone

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.180 
sounded good on all those one microphone
for<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.150> purposes<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.830> was<00:03:01.980> worth

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
for all purposes then it was worth

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.790 
for all purposes then it was worth
measuring<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.959> approach<00:03:04.470> that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
measuring and that's the approach that

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.699 
measuring and that's the approach that
ata<00:03:05.310> has<00:03:05.550> gone<00:03:05.820> back<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.989> their<00:03:07.290> design

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
ata has gone back to in their design

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
ata has gone back to in their design
work<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:09.110> specifically<00:03:10.160> has<00:03:11.160> used<00:03:11.610> with<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
work and specifically has used with the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.620 
work and specifically has used with the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
feedback from the beta testers so it was

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.840 
feedback from the beta testers so it was
really<00:03:31.170> good<00:03:31.380> because<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:32.100> had<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> chance<00:03:32.700> to

in those applications and find different

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.190 
in those applications and find different
places<00:03:47.519> where<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.209> know<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.570> really<00:03:48.750> shined

in that aspect it very much has that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.300 
in that aspect it very much has that
characteristic<00:03:52.739> ribbon<00:03:53.489> flavor<00:03:54.360> but<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:54.930> a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
characteristic ribbon flavor but it's a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.560 
characteristic ribbon flavor but it's a
distinctly<00:03:56.310> different<00:03:56.400> sounding<00:03:57.060> microphone

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
distinctly different sounding microphone

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.050 
distinctly different sounding microphone
to<00:03:57.870> every<00:03:58.290> other<00:03:58.410> ribbon<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.280> own<00:03:59.609> or<00:03:59.970> that
