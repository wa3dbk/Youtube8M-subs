 Arithmetic time would have been fine 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.670
 What's in my head 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.570
 There is no rhythm pattern called 12/8 so I can not talk about the rhythm pattern 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.549
 That's why 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:30.090

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.020
 I will do 3 rounds 4 times a night 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.110
 so 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.400
 It is 12 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.650
 Easy to understand at first 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.959

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:16.430
 Yes, next to by adding the Basudamu and snare drum 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.700
