 after which we continue to cook a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 moderate heat for about 15 20 minutes 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.490

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:56.180
 about 15 minutes and after 15 minutes precise 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.090

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.610
 look at our condensed milk and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.980

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.010
 this condensed milk has nothing to 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.960
 envy to what you find the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.750
 supermarket because so to speak 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.600
 what you all surely know 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.360

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.350
 I invite you if you want to use a 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.680

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.580
 what it was like for here if you want 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.070
 keep it longer 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.700

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.320
 jar 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.900
 so when it's still hot like 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.700

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.100
