00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
the whole family atmosphere and that's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.859 
the whole family atmosphere and that's
what<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:27.979> try<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.219> keep<00:01:28.429> around<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.270> it's

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
what we try to keep around here and it's

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.940 
what we try to keep around here and it's
like<00:01:29.960> when<00:01:30.109> anybody<00:01:30.409> that<00:01:30.500> comes<00:01:30.619> here<00:01:30.829> is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
like when anybody that comes here is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.929 
like when anybody that comes here is
like<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.189> know<00:01:31.250> we're<00:01:31.460> all<00:01:31.549> brothers<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
like you know we're all brothers and

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.910 
like you know we're all brothers and
that's<00:01:32.240> pretty<00:01:32.479> much<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.929> mindset<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.770> we

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
that's pretty much the mindset that we

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.859 
that's pretty much the mindset that we
have<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.579> you<00:01:34.640> know<00:01:34.789> to<00:01:34.939> be<00:01:35.270> stepped<00:01:35.659> into

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
have and so you know to be stepped into

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.090 
have and so you know to be stepped into
the<00:01:36.020> family<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.530> know<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.679> never<00:01:36.770> would<00:01:37.070> have

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the family you know I never would have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.239 
the family you know I never would have
thought<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.340> would<00:01:37.579> be<00:01:37.700> possible<00:01:38.770> out<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:40.100> my

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
thought that would be possible out in my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:41.380 
thought that would be possible out in my
head<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.490> was<00:01:40.729> kind<00:01:40.909> of<00:01:40.939> thinking<00:01:40.999> about<00:01:41.179> this

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
head I was kind of thinking about this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.340 
head I was kind of thinking about this
is<00:01:41.570> probably<00:01:41.780> first<00:01:42.380> um<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.880> know<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.350> goal

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
is probably first um you know the goal

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.139 
is probably first um you know the goal
that<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.619> scored<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.189> last<00:01:46.340> goal<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
that I scored the last goal in the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.330 
that I scored the last goal in the
Cotton<00:01:47.450> Bowl<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:48.679> think<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.069> last

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
Cotton Bowl and I think it was a last

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
Cotton Bowl and I think it was a last
call<00:01:49.490> everybody<00:01:49.819> dials<00:01:50.600> player<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.929> think

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
call everybody dials player I think

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.860 
call everybody dials player I think
that's<00:01:51.439> one<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:51.979> really<00:01:52.130> stands<00:01:52.429> out<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:52.759> me

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870
