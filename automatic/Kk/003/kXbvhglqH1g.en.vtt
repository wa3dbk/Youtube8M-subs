background<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.390> let's<00:00:51.600> open<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.050> tune<00:00:52.350> wiki<00:00:52.530> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
background so let's open up tune wiki so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
background so let's open up tune wiki so
to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> wiki<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> basically<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> radio

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to the wiki is basically a radio

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
to the wiki is basically a radio
application<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.850> iphone<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> ipod

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
application for the iphone and ipod

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
application for the iphone and ipod
touch<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:59.600> that's<00:01:00.600> basically<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:02.120> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
touch and that's basically what it is so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.710 
touch and that's basically what it is so
we'll<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.629> wait<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.080> 2<00:01:04.379> Rickey<00:01:04.589> too<00:01:05.010> old<00:01:05.720> ok

we'll just wait for 2 Rickey too old ok

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
we'll just wait for 2 Rickey too old ok
so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.810> radio<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so you have a radio you can use the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
so you have a radio you can use the
radio<00:01:11.549> copy<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.659> Rose<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:15.830> let's<00:01:16.830> say<00:01:17.159> hip<00:01:17.939> hop

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
radio copy on Rose and let's say hip hop

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
radio copy on Rose and let's say hip hop
and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> says<00:01:20.400> loading<00:01:20.640> stations<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and then it says loading stations and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
and then it says loading stations and
then<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.909> play<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.860> getting<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then it will play go just be getting the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
then it will play go just be getting the
street<00:01:27.259> okay<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.130> simple<00:01:30.979> okay

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
street okay so that's a very simple okay

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
street okay so that's a very simple okay
so<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.700> probably<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> says
