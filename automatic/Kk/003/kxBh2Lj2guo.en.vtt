00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
think it's about here on her maybe or

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.440 
think it's about here on her maybe or
shorter<00:04:12.530> i'm<00:04:12.650> not<00:04:12.799> sure<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:13.040> probably<00:04:14.000> about

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
shorter i'm not sure but probably about

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.509 
shorter i'm not sure but probably about
there<00:04:14.720> when<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.620> take<00:04:15.829> your<00:04:15.859> hair<00:04:16.010> out<00:04:16.160> it

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
there when you take your hair out it

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.599 
there when you take your hair out it
will<00:04:16.700> be<00:04:16.849> on<00:04:16.970> even<00:04:17.359> it'll<00:04:17.690> be<00:04:17.810> kind<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.079> like

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
will be on even it'll be kind of like

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.759 
will be on even it'll be kind of like
like<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:20.299> it'll<00:04:20.720> go<00:04:20.840> like

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
like this like it'll go like

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.029 
like this like it'll go like
this<00:04:22.759> because<00:04:23.419> when<00:04:24.169> they<00:04:24.319> put<00:04:24.530> their<00:04:24.710> hair<00:04:24.919> in

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
this because when they put their hair in

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.680 
this because when they put their hair in
the<00:04:25.160> braid<00:04:25.370> they<00:04:25.610> cut<00:04:25.819> it<00:04:25.849> at<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> end<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.569> that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
the braid they cut it at the end so that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.900 
the braid they cut it at the end so that
it's<00:04:26.840> even<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:28.069> when<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.280> take<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.580> out<00:04:28.669> it's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
it's even but when you take it out it's

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.550 
it's even but when you take it out it's
not<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.479> doesn't<00:04:29.750> look<00:04:29.870> even<00:04:30.199> anymore

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
not that it doesn't look even anymore

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.409 
not that it doesn't look even anymore
but<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.099> still<00:04:31.370> rehearse<00:04:31.699> hair<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.150> still

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
but it's still rehearse hair is still

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.670 
but it's still rehearse hair is still
really<00:04:32.539> fun<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.900> play<00:04:33.050> with<00:04:33.199> because<00:04:33.409> she

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
really fun to play with because she

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.200 
really fun to play with because she
doesn't<00:04:33.830> have<00:04:33.949> a<00:04:34.069> part<00:04:34.370> which<00:04:34.849> makes<00:04:35.090> it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
doesn't have a part which makes it

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.490 
doesn't have a part which makes it
easier<00:04:35.569> to<00:04:35.629> do<00:04:35.870> lots<00:04:36.199> of<00:04:36.349> different

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
easier to do lots of different

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.850 
easier to do lots of different
