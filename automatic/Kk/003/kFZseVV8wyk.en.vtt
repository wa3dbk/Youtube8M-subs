00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.680
 who opposes the axé but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.139
 czapnik mertian that mike to cerium his 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 jokes 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.839
 better people it's fatma 91 hd 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 I hope you are well then at 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.900
 day meet up for a pleyel review 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.090
 that of yaya turned the middle 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.439
 recuperator of manchester city you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.070
 see that placing them in a boat the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.750
 1st league 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.520
 I was asked in the review of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.110
 falcao so in the duke falcao review 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.270
 there were 2-3 comments asking me 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.390
 yaya touré including a comment with 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.770
 several sprout blue sprouts on it and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.420
 so just frozen does especially 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.829
 that in addition yesterday I was asked to do 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.300
 erosion a little bit on media 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 field story to change scorers 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
 so here's the magazine dieye in turn and there 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.640
 you have the statins iem that scrolls to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.749
 note that as it is the review of a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 recovery medium 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.359
 do not expect clips from 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 madness it's mostly phases 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.409
 defensive and recovery phases 1 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.329
 to illustrate the pass quality 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.370
 there are still some assists he 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.659
 there are one or two goals I did not like to score 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.039
 a lot with him because level of 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.469
 angles I get them right 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.699
 with this player there so that's it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.309
 just about everything I had to say 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.659
 on yaya touré I'll start already in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.010
 explaining that the yaya turned me I the 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.409
 do in recovery medium like you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 could see I think in the middle 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 central in a 4-3-3 so still 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 I think the player is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 much more I think the player 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 will be a lot more offensive than there 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 because that's true it's 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 really the last the last rampart 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.830
 even if they do not show me bad finally 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.570
 I find that finally when you play in a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 two with whom he climbs he rides he does not hesitate 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 not to ride and he can bring 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 Besides, he even has stats at the level 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.680
 pass quality etc 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 for me you can even play it in 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.790
 offensive midfielder he might be good 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.260
 but I prefer to play it in 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.550
 middle center for the friendly in the middle 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.440
 defensive for the simple and good reason 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.870
 that he is tall he is good of the head and 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.580
 he is very strong so for me it's 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.770
 really the control tower in front of the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.450
 defense as first receiver 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.160
 so yaya touré what can we say 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.660
 of him is that already he has a very 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.110
 good head game as I say they 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.310
 closed of 87 1 m 88 I believe he has a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
 very good stat of the head it's true 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 that he does not have a huge manceau stat 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.800
 but the advantage is like it's big 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.660
 bath he's not he did not jump he did not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.980
 not jumped too high for 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.530
 recover balloons from the head 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.700
 he has a really good pass quality 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 very impressive 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.020
 I think it's the best receiver 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.540
 May 2 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.130
 team the vidal marchisio for me he 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.660
 is above as a pass 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.590
 yet it's heavy in and then 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.120
 Besides, it's not wanting 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.770
 recuperators but it is as 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630
 comparison in high-level 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.110
 environments 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.790
 for me he's also good at because a 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.350
 moutinho holds moutinho not the boost 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.820
 but only a bit of normal signals 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.220
 it's still saying the quality of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.780
 recovery that is quite exceptional at 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.790
 level of taste tackles tackles 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.290
 slipped it is good then that with the state 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.760
 slip and I did not put it because 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.220
 I do not hear that much with the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.510
 way I defend I do not throw myself 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.370
 do not throw me a lot I do not tackle 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 many me it's mostly tackles 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.390
 standing is based on anticipation he has 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.400
 a good stat in anticipation precisely 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.050
 in tackle of goulaine good stats to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 the shoulder he really holds very very 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.740
 well the quality of pass so as I have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.120
 said she is very good anyway allows 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.840
 to make nice openings that this 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 either in the air or at the ground level 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.600
 I make him draw the corners I find 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.240
 that the corner he really stretches very 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.740
 well after that it's true that bass and you 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.900
 lose someone of size in the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.980
 repair surface but I have some 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.240
 wrong to find it in the surface 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.860
 precisely because low as you have 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 could see the team I have very good 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 leading players in this team I have 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.050
 hoods I have bags gd diaby 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.410
 so usually it's safer than 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.660
 go on will drop the ball and there is round 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.280
 he has a little trouble with a little bit of trouble in 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.930
 repair surfaces on the corner 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.070
 so I prefer him to withdraw because 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.250
 he has a very good pass quality 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.780
 on corner you could see that my 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.070
 hitting power the power of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.120
 strike and there he is very big stats 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.510
 in striking power 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.740
 in languedoc in 74 something like 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.060
 so I did not put them in the most 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.250
 but hey you see that the power of 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.470
 strike makes the ball go very very 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.490
 very very strong in front of the cages he is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.690
 not bad in front of the cages 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.010
 good I have not had the opportunity to be 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.030
 a lot of times you across goal 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.260
 could see I was once before 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.540
 the cages that made it all the same but that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.030
 did it it was at the beginning of the review 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 but here is the point level 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.230
 negatives if we can say about the points 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.280
 negatives of yaya touré it's its price 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.200
 it's true that its price is still 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.209
 quite high even though for me this is the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.530
 best middle recoverer of the game I 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.000
 go explain to me i did other bpl 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.670
 because in fact he redeemed for the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.440
 review but I did other bpl when 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.000
 I had sold yaya touré without yaya 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.889
 round middle recuperator I never 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.780
 found the equivalent I find that 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.000
 he puts too much serenity too 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.650
 in a midfield and I have not 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 found of equivalent barclays this first 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.440
 league even in the game it's for me 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.880
 the best recovery medium of the game 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.650
 so for me it's worth it but it 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.030
 with its price here is ilaha illa 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.350
 exceeded it has more than one hundred thousand credit 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.580
 I think I let go of your games to redeem them 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.710
 7000 traders credit something 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.120
 like that so it's true it's not 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.540
 given to anyone it's not given to 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.940
 everybody 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.260
 and that's after we agility the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.699
 balance I find he has stats 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.169
 pretty weak it's with it's really 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.720
 woody is really power 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.910
 it's a buffalo is then a thing that c 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.810
 is rather signed but I have not 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.280
 that's why he has a 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.479
 old stats in a free kick he was born 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.600
 stats in free kick just disgusting 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.800
 rela 66 something like that he marks 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.690
 it's him who gets the free kicks 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.220
 with manchester city and he has marked 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.720
 already two or three this season or 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.250
 more 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.020
 why why did you do that 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.400
 is thus launched we finish with the ball 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.070
 last clip of this review so a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.590
 corner shot by yaya touré on assaidi 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.970
 and we see the little flyback on 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.710
 small control followed by the recovery of 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.139
 volley gave us a decisive pass and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.760
 it's a rather nice clip you 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.680
 see seen slowed again 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.210
 yaya touré who is who raps control 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.690
 of a flick of foot left foot in 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.610
 the skylight 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.470
 So the balance of what yaya touré 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.479
 that can be said of him so low the strength 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.800
 in the most his strength as I said 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.580
 here he is really very very powerful 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.979
 he has more than 95 in strength his vision of 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.110
 game it's like I explained it here and 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.510
 best raiser I've seen for 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.160
 the moment and it has the quality of pass 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.650
 truly exceptional and acts of 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.789
 caviars from elsewhere so the corner 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.780
 I put them in the most because I 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.010
 not want to include kicking 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.870
 stopped precisely because of the blows 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.490
 francs his speed I find he's 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.410
 rather it has a pretty decent speed 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.970
 these ball controls his responsiveness his 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.169
 headset aggression then 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.210
 aggressiveness I did not talk about it but 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.830
 it's a pit bull 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.350
 he is really very very very very 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.669
 aggressive on the ball carrier 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.169
 interception tackle slipped tackle mud 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.150
 4 stars bad foot it has the advantage 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.800
 to have the four shots the four 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.030
 trap anything what benefit 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.370
 to have both feet so that's true 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.780
 that it can be used to get out of 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.639
 certain delicate situations 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.169
 its quality passes its power of 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.840
 strikes and so in the east - I put his 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.310
 price his agility his statue in balance 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.810
 and the free kicks I did not understand 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.430
 this stat in a free kick which is rather 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.810
 bad and so I put the rating of 20 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.759
 on 20 because it's the best 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.009
 recovering middle of the game that's despite 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.419
 that he still has more and more 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.400
 less than they are a little bit 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.330
 problematic to say the price does it 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.599
 that they are not accessible to all 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.820
 world 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.650
 agility balance it does not really 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.300
 worry because bassa stats in force 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.690
 actually doing that is really good 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.039
 His legs 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.570
 and so here I have not put any 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.009
 statistics with because we do not care 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.240
 a little bit of the number of goals 2 assists 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.050
 decisive with him since it's a 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.880
 recovery medium 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.470
 so that's all for this review 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.909
 it is this review you liked think to 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.650
 put a thumb to a small 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.300
 comment is apt subscribers if it's 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.740
 not already done and so well it was late 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.479
 match 80 hd i'll tell you next 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.569
 people take care of you by all the 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.569
 world
