00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
well will we see a sequel I mean that

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.300 
well will we see a sequel I mean that
remains<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.290> unknown<00:03:17.499> at<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:17.829> point<00:03:17.920> on

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
remains to be unknown at this point on

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.979 
remains to be unknown at this point on
even<00:03:18.999> though<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> first<00:03:19.390> game<00:03:19.599> hasn't<00:03:19.810> even

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
even though the first game hasn't even

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.630 
even though the first game hasn't even
been<00:03:20.200> released<00:03:20.379> yet<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:20.769> overall<00:03:21.219> guys<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
been released yet but overall guys I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.970 
been released yet but overall guys I
think<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> game<00:03:22.480> will<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.140> very<00:03:23.409> good<00:03:23.650> I'm

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
think the game will be very good I'm

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.729 
think the game will be very good I'm
just<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.400> little<00:03:24.519> worried<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.499> replay<00:03:26.499> value

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
just a little worried on replay value

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.280 
just a little worried on replay value
for<00:03:27.129> example<00:03:27.579> if<00:03:28.329> you<00:03:28.540> go<00:03:28.659> back<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.870> play<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
for example if you go back and play the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.349 
for example if you go back and play the
game<00:03:29.319> multiple<00:03:29.799> times<00:03:30.040> will<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.879> have<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
game multiple times will you have the

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.170 
game multiple times will you have the
same<00:03:31.599> experience<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.890> feel<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:33.640> if<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.999> game

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
same experience I feel like if the game

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.119 
same experience I feel like if the game
has<00:03:34.390> different<00:03:34.810> experiences<00:03:35.469> every<00:03:35.829> single

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
has different experiences every single

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.459 
has different experiences every single
time<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.340> play<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.120> would<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:38.109> much

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
time you play it it would be that much

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.369 
time you play it it would be that much
better<00:03:38.920> um<00:03:39.480> personally<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.659> me<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:41.019> that

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
better um personally for me I think that

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.809 
better um personally for me I think that
that's<00:03:41.499> what<00:03:41.709> separates<00:03:42.129> good<00:03:42.430> games<00:03:42.700> from

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
that's what separates good games from

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.000 
that's what separates good games from
bad<00:03:43.090> games<00:03:43.359> replay<00:03:43.689> value<00:03:44.019> how<00:03:44.620> many<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.889> you

guys get bored after you beat a certain
video<00:03:46.959> game<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.650> play<00:03:47.859> it<00:03:47.980> once<00:03:48.159> you<00:03:48.310> play<00:03:48.489> it

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
video game you play it once you play it

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.789 
video game you play it once you play it
twice<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.120> that's<00:03:49.299> pretty<00:03:49.480> much<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.719> on<00:03:50.109> the

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
twice and that's pretty much it on the

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.349 
twice and that's pretty much it on the
