00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.690
 so here I saw my cultural pot this world power 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.659
 times 5,865 euros in infancy and -1 5 me that appears 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.419
 while the jsmb already have this young that 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.119
 the world finals here when I came here 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.619
 she denounces 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.659
 power less than three years 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.659
 I know that the exhibitors there is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 if the exhibitors have nothing to lose 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.220
 I know that this one will only be 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.010
 negative 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 so I'm going out I'm negative that is to say that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 for having rolled down 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.440
 the same number alone 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 since precisely when you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.730
 I can very well write 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.520
 12 hours 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 time 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.060
 in support of its launch on the 3rd 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.310
 so then let's think about at least one ground 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 by taking an interest in -21 it's less three times that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 so I'll do it in writing 6-3 however this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420
 squared 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 so why are we simplified 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.110
 things here I've never 1003 this world power 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 times fifth world power 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.120
 the least five points are at stake the drop 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.840
 multiply per year 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.040
 a week ago the sims 3 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 multiplied by two - 3 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.670
 more and more buses that were not bending 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 this speech in ce2 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 then investors the following - 38 seats 3 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 but we do not take anymore we wonder what I'm going to do with the exhibitors 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.840
 subtract them this time 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 - 3 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.099
 is 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.559
 only Swiss in the running 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.909
 - to say it 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.169
 and that's more and more of his job 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.629
 - the cairo - two this power or six 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.679
 this one is unheard of and only power - 3 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.389
 - jaya - at least 303 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
 this one 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.019
 - worldwide 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 I think we're here 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.129
 so above - we were successful 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.659
 in fact I am the first to be assigned 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.369
 the signal - 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.639
 a growing number of 3 to 3 see 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.169
 at the meaning of this world if the citizen 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.249
 its opposite
