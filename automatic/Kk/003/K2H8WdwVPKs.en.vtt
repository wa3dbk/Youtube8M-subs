00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
cleaning them um they they are basically
the<00:01:36.299> enemies<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.750> they're<00:01:37.049> exactly<00:01:37.320> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the enemies and they're exactly what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.569 
the enemies and they're exactly what
your<00:01:37.710> attacks<00:01:38.070> exist<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.710> they<00:01:40.710> tend<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> not

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
your attacks exist for they tend to not

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
your attacks exist for they tend to not
really<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> much<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.479> challenge<00:01:42.869> because

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
really be much of a challenge because

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
really be much of a challenge because
they're<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.070> part<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> puzzle

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
they're really more part of a puzzle

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.130 
they're really more part of a puzzle
than<00:01:45.030> anything<00:01:45.329> else<00:01:45.479> trying<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> figure<00:01:45.990> out

than anything else trying to figure out
how<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> work<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.549> quick<00:01:48.000> fight<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.540> an

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
how to work in this quick fight with an

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.069 
how to work in this quick fight with an
enemy<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.770> still<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.759> away<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.540> with

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
enemy and and still get away it with

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.160 
enemy and and still get away it with
enough<00:01:52.380> time<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.460> beat<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.700> time

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
enough time to of to beat your time

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.300 
enough time to of to beat your time
because<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.470> can't<00:01:55.680> ignore<00:01:55.890> enemies

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
because you can't ignore enemies

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
because you can't ignore enemies
basically<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> finish<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> level<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
basically when you finish a level it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.990 
basically when you finish a level it
degrades<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.649> things<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
degrades you on two things the the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
degrades you on two things the the
completion<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> finesse<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.680> on

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
completion and the finesse is you see on

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
completion and the finesse is you see on
the<00:02:01.829> screen<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.820> I've<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.390> s

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the screen here and here I've got an s

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.800 
the screen here and here I've got an s
on<00:02:04.020> both<00:02:04.320> finesse<00:02:04.950> regards<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:06.329> getting<00:02:06.659> hit

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
on both finesse regards not getting hit

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
on both finesse regards not getting hit
by<00:02:06.840> enemies<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.530> believe<00:02:08.099> building<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.520> your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
by enemies I believe building up your

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
by enemies I believe building up your
combo<00:02:09.090> how<00:02:09.270> much<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> took<00:02:09.959> stuff<00:02:10.229> like

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
combo how much time you took stuff like

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.400 
combo how much time you took stuff like
that<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.220> completion<00:02:11.790> is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
that and then completion is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.530 
that and then completion is
making<00:02:12.980> sure<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.460> clean<00:02:14.030> off<00:02:14.210> every

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
making sure that you clean off every

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.200 
making sure that you clean off every
enemy<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.080> every<00:02:15.470> surface<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.820> miss<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
enemy and every surface you can miss a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.420 
enemy and every surface you can miss a
tiny<00:02:17.570> bit<00:02:17.930> amount<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.320> stuff<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.770> still<00:02:19.280> get

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
tiny bit amount of stuff and still get

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.610 
tiny bit amount of stuff and still get
an<00:02:19.520> S<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.700> completion<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:20.570> it's<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.380> can't

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
an S and completion but it's you can't

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.890 
an S and completion but it's you can't
miss<00:02:21.800> much<00:02:21.980> at<00:02:22.130> all<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.060> dustforce<00:02:23.570> was

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
miss much at all so dustforce was

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.140 
miss much at all so dustforce was
developed<00:02:24.380> by<00:02:24.560> an<00:02:24.860> indie<00:02:25.160> team<00:02:25.400> called<00:02:25.760> hitbox

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
developed by an indie team called hitbox

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150 
developed by an indie team called hitbox
team<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.290> believe<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:27.980> their<00:02:28.130> first

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
team and I believe this is their first

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.650 
team and I believe this is their first
game<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:28.820> not<00:02:29.000> it's<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.210> first<00:02:29.450> I've<00:02:29.630> heard

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
game if not it's the first I've heard

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.630 
game if not it's the first I've heard
from<00:02:29.990> them<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.320> they<00:02:30.440> did<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.680> fantastic<00:02:30.920> job

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
from them and they did a fantastic job

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.610 
from them and they did a fantastic job
with<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.150> as<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.900> can<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:33.170> here<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> art

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
with it as you can see here the art

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.520 
with it as you can see here the art

fantastic to me the music is great the
music<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.120> probably<00:02:41.420> what<00:02:41.570> stands<00:02:41.840> out<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.080> me

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
music is probably what stands out to me

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.950 
music is probably what stands out to me
most<00:02:42.650> about<00:02:42.800> those<00:02:43.130> came<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:44.150> lot<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
most about those came a lot of it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.410 
most about those came a lot of it
reminds<00:02:45.380> me<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.800> an<00:02:46.220> equal<00:02:46.460> story<00:02:46.790> now

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
maplestory out really I don't really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.630 
maplestory out really I don't really
particularly<00:02:50.180> care<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:50.540> maplestory<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
particularly care for maplestory but the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.770 
particularly care for maplestory but the
soundtrack<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.150> always<00:02:53.360> thought<00:02:53.480> was<00:02:53.600> very

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
soundtrack I always thought was very

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.480 
soundtrack I always thought was very
good<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.620> there<00:02:55.010> are<00:02:55.040> absolutely<00:02:55.220> no

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
good so there are absolutely no

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.250 
good so there are absolutely no
complaints<00:02:55.850> for<00:02:56.090> me<00:02:56.180> there<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.690> also<00:02:56.840> reminds
