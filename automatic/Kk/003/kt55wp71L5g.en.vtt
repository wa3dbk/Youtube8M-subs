00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
you're stopping on this leg and you're

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.140 
you're stopping on this leg and you're
using<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.290> as<00:03:59.500> your<00:03:59.560> controller<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.400> lot<00:04:01.030> of

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
using this as your controller a lot of

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.600 
using this as your controller a lot of
guys<00:04:01.300> try<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.660> use<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:02.890> as<00:04:03.070> a<00:04:03.100> control<00:04:03.580> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
guys try to use this as a control and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.460 
guys try to use this as a control and
stopping<00:04:04.150> they<00:04:04.240> wander<00:04:04.630> being<00:04:04.840> off<00:04:05.020> balance

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
stopping they wander being off balance

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.320 
stopping they wander being off balance
now<00:04:05.680> just<00:04:06.370> elevate<00:04:06.760> straight<00:04:07.030> up<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.270> air

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
now just elevate straight up in the air

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.900 
now just elevate straight up in the air
and<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.660> elevate<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.230> finish<00:04:08.500> over<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.740> top

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
and I elevate and I finish over the top

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.370 
and I elevate and I finish over the top
so<00:04:09.910> now<00:04:10.090> he<00:04:10.150> really<00:04:10.450> doesn't<00:04:10.600> know<00:04:10.780> what<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.990> do

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
so now he really doesn't know what to do

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.960 
so now he really doesn't know what to do
as<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.709> defender<00:04:12.160> doesn't<00:04:12.370> know<00:04:12.520> if<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:12.670> will<00:04:12.820> go

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
as a defender doesn't know if I will go

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.699 
as a defender doesn't know if I will go
