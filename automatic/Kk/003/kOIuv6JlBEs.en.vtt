00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.020
 Here is my reference that I up to the height 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.480
 the blind already worked in 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.809
 in the middle I will chain 27 stitches 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.250
 three stitches on the right and left, which I did 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.620
 stand around the aperture later 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 incorporate 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.410
 But first I have to go with you 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.410
 working aperture 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.160
 I have a provisional one here 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.710
 mesh stop worked and 29 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.890
 mesh added remember the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.090
 air masses chain out of the stitches 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.070
 be worked out for 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.659
 I have a provisional stop 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.220
 worked tutorial 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.740
 I'm going to fade in the link right now 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.530
 strictly six stitches right smooth 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.080
 then comes a row in the two of me 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.540
 mesh right together and one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.220
 envelope work two stitches again 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.970
 right then an envelope 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.800
 That's how the cinemas are made. I'm fading right away 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.950
 the link to tutorial 1 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.420
 when her piece strictly then flips 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.340
 arise these little pieks you have to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.440
 on the other side so if you have the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660
 Knitted holes again has six rows 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.700
 knit the iris the same amount of time 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.490
 Here you will see that again in the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.679
 single six rows knitted down 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.140
 then the hole row and then six 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.649
 stretched over it again if I did 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 that then fold up the little ones 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.890
 cinemas 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.170
 Now I read the auxiliary thread on 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.700
 the side that is not the knot and 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.410
 take the stitches I pull now 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.770
 the orange helpful venturing out and 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.170
 Remember the single stitch 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.480
 I showed you that in one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.360
 tutorial I hide the link for this 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.970
 again a mesh for mesh 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.660
 I take on this way 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.660
 my needle 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.040
 Now I am at the last mission 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.370
 reached 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.110
 Orange have helpful rides equals 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.540
 the last stitches are out of the way 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.709
 always a bit harder because of the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.709
 meshes disappear so easily 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.440
 so now I have it right 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.650
 still and now I can thread the addition 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.650
 pull 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.760
 Now I push the stitches on mine 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.650
 Needles and now I have on the front 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.110
 and on the back or under and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.380
 top like you want the stitches 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.070
 I am now in a row together 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.770
 route 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:12.890
 I take the mesh on one 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:15.140
 Needle and knit a round over it too 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.650
 this again the link to the tutorial 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 to work on coco here I have now 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.830
 my finished dazzling which I now in 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.200
 my hot water bottle cover one i work for 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.709
 take the first three wash 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.910
 then I would have 27 stitches around then 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.910
 I knit the round to the end 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.459
 I now knit three stitches 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 and then I start with the decrease and 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.510
 Although as I always the back mesh 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.519
 over the front mesh goal here sting 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.610
 from left to right in the stitches and 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.690
 There is also a tutorial on this topic 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.860
 how to knit it off I'll be the one 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.930
 Show link immediately 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.380
 Overall, I would now 27 stitches 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.479
 she knits one goal over the next 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.979
 then I knit a stitch again and 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.660
 The next one again about this mesh 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.760
 so now I am right at the end of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:34.350
 a decrease you see here forms 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:38.490
 the supportive and then I stretch the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.889
 last three stitches of these dogs and 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.460
 I knit the rest of the round too 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.910
 The End 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.160
 until I'm back at the beginning of my ab 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:52.470
 Kat row I am now taking my blind 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.030
 put you in the right position and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.580
 defends them incorporate 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.660
 I have it on my needlepoint 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.979
 I prefer it and now I knit it 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.410
 first two stitch together and 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.960
 I simply knit the entire blind 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.530
 on my nail with smooth right 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.150
 mesh 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.310
 so you always have to look at them 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.870
 pull the beginning a bit tighter 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.870
 so that no hole is created 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.739
 so now I am right at the end of the 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.339
 dazzling and must be the last 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:35.709
 mesh now incorporated log 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:38.559
 I'm knitting a bit big now 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:43.779
 the last stitch of the blind and the 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:48.479
 first round and round together 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:48.479
