00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.030
 and now we are in the style stand 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.670
 institute I have been told that you can 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.460
 tell me what are the colors that 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.680
 I feel better 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 well we did a test 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.869
 temperature to predict if we are warm 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.180
 or cold this depends on the temperature 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.890
 of our 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.930
 it does not really have much to do with 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.430
 the color of the skin but with the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.830
 temperature of our blood that 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.810
 determines if we are warm or cold that 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.790
 we can know it through a very 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.790
 simple with these two candles that are called 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.520
 the time a golden and a silver the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.030
 silver represents cold tones and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.770
 golden the pale ones means that I 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 science dance is that I am hot 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.190
 or cold 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.609
 of albacete 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.160
 interesting and that's personality of 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.730
 this good but also has to 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.730
 see with some 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.360
 basically surroundings 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.020
 well at this moment Peru is due 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.050
 find out if caruso is warm or 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.050
 cold 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.979
 ah 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 then this shows that you will 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.800
 break is when we place from 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 then by discarding we know that you are 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.590
 cold cold temperature 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.670
 I am a cold man 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.210
 like to be hot 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210
 reality 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.299
 this trade mark 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 ah 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.600
 we have the alternative to know how 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.540
 dress ourselves already without 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.710
 need for more advice discovering 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.310
 what is our color palette for 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.189
 the part 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.349
 to the body but these colors are your 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.150

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.250
 where are you trying to use them in the area 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.040
