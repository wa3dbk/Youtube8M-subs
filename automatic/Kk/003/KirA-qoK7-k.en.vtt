00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.889
 so here's down I just resign for three years for me is with issy 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.669
 the moulineaux 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.059
 so because we have a longer-term percent project that I liked 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.529
 so with the recruits with all this and and their high-level projects do not 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.439
 so that's why I know for three years with this team 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.519
 we have the season is not over yet but there we are still 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.319
 nearly 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.729
 it's true that down in the optics of the progression down to pro b it's 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.289
 not necessarily afp 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100
 it's not one could say that it's not necessarily the best thing but I 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.360
 think the longer term it can be paid 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.250
 that's what amf 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.270
 Roman big rookie to try to go back in proa directly to the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 next 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.330
 and behind the high school of 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.829
 in a hurry to keep up and to design something in the longer term 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.430
 jonquiÃ¨re 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 in the conduit 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 10 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260
 studies 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 victor video 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 with you wrong 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 28 years old 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 in France as soon as possible 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 people 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.020
 there the current season for what it is 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 will not bury being completely finished yet but it's true that my for 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.990
 me it's a change since 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.070
 it was my first time playing pro 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.220
 and even in europe for the two young people who play with me percent 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.590
 he led 3 but what holds also another Chinese m 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730
 it is also the first time that the good weather and their acts 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.660
 and so bayonne we discovered a little bit that we had a little bit what 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.010
 this riddle to the axa pe masters was obvious 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.050
 risk he knew we were the weakest team mayor 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.190
 when we are young we were torn apart we tried to win the maximum of matches 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.720
 no 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 very good 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.689
 nowadays here - 300 people downstairs I'm here I go back to my goals 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:22.149
 not that I had set myself to win with a lot of majora so know that the 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.589
 thing before turns 2 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.259
 47 48% 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.569
 so that the goals are apathetic for abstention in paris still remains 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.819
 market case 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.079
 and we are trying to fight for% the baron what we are trying to yield between 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.549
 us to try to win the most matches and 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.019
 take what is there to take 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.499
 there it is sure that it plays a lot of morale of the team because 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.879
 Well, of course, when we do not play, I think we do not always win 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.869
 I mean my aunt was counting on daring to clip 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.879
 it's really hard to win at albi madiba 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.549
 it's true that sometimes in the meantime it's a little bit there 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.449
 to see senegal still has not four to go up the team and for 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.129
 try to fight as we say we are young we knew it at the beginning of the season 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.109
 that it was going to be like this 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.229
 and we are here to pull out for trial to take the maximum of 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.199
 matches and even if we do not play the top of the table and we keep his steps 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.589
 it's not a problem the goal is true it's won for me it's still 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.289
 to gain experience especially for years to follow
