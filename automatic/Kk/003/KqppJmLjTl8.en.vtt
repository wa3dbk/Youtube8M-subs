00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 and we are going to introduce a new module of 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.930
 content that we have not yet seen the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.430
 Image module with text basically 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.800
 This module offers us a 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.440
 combination of the image module itself 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.750
 along with the entire text module 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.680
 content that we enter with respect 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.990
 The text will appear directly in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.270
 page as we saw earlier 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.669
 and the image we will be able to edit it from the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.010
 same way as you see the image is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.629
 aligned in this case in a way 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.130
 default to the left of the text 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.070
 but it is something that we can change 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.950
 and also like the rest of the images 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.530
 we could link for it we carry the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.410
 mouse to the link button we click on 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.060
 him and we have two possibilities of 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.520
 establish an internal link or 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.840
 establish an external link or a 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.880
 email address in this case 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.760
 we could enter a url 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.130
 complete and it would take us 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.809
 external to that page simply 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.600
 we will have to click on insert 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.420
 link however we are going to link that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.300
 image internally to the store 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.740
 online we click on insert link and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.590
 we click on save we have 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.979
 edited the text and image module with 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.869
 A link to our online store from 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.910
 that image that we have introduced what 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's do it 's the same process let's 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.850
 to duplicate it and enter it in 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 rest of columns
