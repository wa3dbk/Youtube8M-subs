00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.149
 a few days ago I published on my page that 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.919
 if you would like the idea that I went up 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.509
 is a series of trivia about halo 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.250
 it seems that they really supported the idea and 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.080
 therefore I will do it and it serves that with 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 I keep this cemetery alive 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.430
 343 cataron we call today I will speak 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.260
 of a little-known weapon in the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.060
 halo universe and is the hammer of 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 tartan is the weapon actually called 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.010
 fist of rock by the way the word rock 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.260
 means blood in Sanskrit a language 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.880
 indicated the weapon originally belonged 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.800
 the old bruce leader who 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.270
 it was just before tartars this brut 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.220
 it was called me that views but it was 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.200
 killed in combat by his nephew the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.450
 already mentioned Tartars using this 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.160
 special hammer to demolish his skull 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.050
 since then this health became 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.150
 in leader for the arrived to bruce 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.070
 using the rock fist as a weapon 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.690
 ceremonial but it was not just a stick with 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.850
 a stone like lights but a weapon 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.920
 quite versatile the weapon is capable of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.930
 play almost impenetrable shields 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.090
 attract objects and launch them activate 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
 camouflage and shoot different types of 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.140
 laser in addition to all this its strength 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.970
 gravitational can basically kill 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.770
 any one of an impact in a way 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.350
 much stronger than uma 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.270
 gravitational the last characteristic of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.490
 use for this weapon is that your radio is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.380
 very high even though the carrier 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.390
 fail hit by several meters of 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.430
 distance is the gravitational force that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 the rock fist produces is capable of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.270
 send you to fly an amount 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 considerably dangerous meters 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.530
 Extra details is the interesting 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.260
 obsession of the bronzes towards this weapon 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.380
 it's not exactly known why but 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.440
 the skull is activated and the grones 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 will give many mentions of said weapon 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.259
 especially when they are asleep and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.150
 they will light your name in signs of fear 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.700
 and respect as if it were a used weapon 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.560
 to punish ground and with the ability 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.290
 of damage of the weapon with punishing 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.119
 it probably means killing without 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.950
 However there is a small error in everything 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.630
 this when a great can see full 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.040
 view to the master chief using a hammer 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.320
 of gravity of wit 3 looks 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.300
 comments on the demon carrying the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.399
 fist road now this is understandable 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 originally the gravity hammer did not 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.880
 was going to exist all the brutes almost that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.649
 leave lotteries they would use guns called 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.540
 fist of the road that would be like the version 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.050
 of so much light but less strong this was 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.850
 trimmed at the end and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 for what we know today as the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.900
 gravitational hammer but the dialogues 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 of the drones apparently were 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.920
 forgotten to be removed when not 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.110
 However a good excuse is that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 drones have never been very bright and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 probably they tended to confuse 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 common hammer with this hammer 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.460
 special at the end in the death of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.990
 tartars the whereabouts of the rock fist 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.210
 of is unknown but most likely 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.280
 was picked up and confiscated in custody 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.810
 by the inquisitor's troops who 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.880
 they were in charge of the death of this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 same anyway and this was all 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.690
 I will try to convert this from curiosities 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.220
 of ice in a series of videos in his 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.750
 own playlist 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.700
 if you like how it's going it would help me 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.990
 very much giving me what they liked they liked 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.030
 the video in general you can give me 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 like or something that's all and we'll see 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.650
 until next time thank you very much provide 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.650
 of drones 343 outside
