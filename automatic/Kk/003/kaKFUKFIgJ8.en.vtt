samples of sub loops now I always like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.410 
samples of sub loops now I always like
to<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:51.199> reverse<00:00:52.199> symbol<00:00:53.149> see<00:00:54.149> when

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to get a good reverse symbol see when

kick<00:01:03.350> not<00:01:04.350> spelled<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:06.560> like<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kick not spelled like that I like this

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.780 
kick not spelled like that I like this
deadmau5<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> also<00:01:10.790> nice<00:01:11.930> snare<00:01:13.790> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
deadmau5 one then also nice snare so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
deadmau5 one then also nice snare so
like<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.479> too<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.159> all

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
like this one too so then you have all

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
like this one too so then you have all
your<00:01:17.430> samples<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> way<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
your samples in here now the way this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640 
your samples in here now the way this
works<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.479> banks<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> these

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
works is you have these banks and these

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
works is you have these banks and these
patterns<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.270> works<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
patterns and the way that works is it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.969 
patterns and the way that works is it
when<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> go<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.590> i'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> add

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
when you go down here i'm going to add

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
when you go down here i'm going to add
in<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> drums<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.780> pattern<00:01:28.140> track<00:01:28.409> instead

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
in the drums and a pattern track instead

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.359 
in the drums and a pattern track instead
of<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.890> note<00:01:29.040> track<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> let's<00:01:31.890> say<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.100> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
of a note track so let's say we will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.940 
of a note track so let's say we will
tell<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tell make it in right here so this is a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
tell make it in right here so this is a
kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.369> corresponding<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> a-1<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
kind of corresponding to a-1 which is a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
kind of corresponding to a-1 which is a
want<00:01:37.890> obviously<00:01:38.240> okay<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.299> let's<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.380> let's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
want obviously okay so let's see let's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
want obviously okay so let's see let's
put<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.610> instead<00:01:41.939> let's<00:01:42.630> come

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
put a one right here instead let's come

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.179 
put a one right here instead let's come
in<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> reverse<00:01:43.259> crash<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> just

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in with a reverse crash so you just

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
in with a reverse crash so you just
click<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.119> start<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
click that to start right there the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
click that to start right there the
reason<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.950> no<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> put<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.759> there

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
reason I like no to put it right there

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
reason I like no to put it right there
is<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.290> takes<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.619> entire<00:01:49.829> measure<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is because it takes an entire measure to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
is because it takes an entire measure to
build<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.570> start<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> crash

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
build up so you just start the crash

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
build up so you just start the crash
right<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.250> should<00:01:53.490> hit<00:01:53.670> right<00:01:53.970> at<00:01:54.090> nine

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
right there it should hit right at nine

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
right there it should hit right at nine
so<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.200> we're<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.189> based<00:01:56.399> off

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
so then we're see here it's based off

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:05.110 
so then we're see here it's based off
the<00:01:56.759> first<00:01:56.969> tutorial<00:01:57.090> Stoke

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.460 

all<00:02:06.120> right<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.690> go<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.870> heard<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.230> I

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
all right there you go you heard that I

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.920 
all right there you go you heard that I
also<00:02:07.980> also<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:08.820> always<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.840> my

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
also also like to always on think my

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.780 
also also like to always on think my
samples<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.500> turn<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.710> level<00:02:11.040> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.490> way

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
samples and turn the level all the way

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
samples and turn the level all the way
up<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.750> some<00:02:12.900> reason<00:02:12.930> they<00:02:13.290> always

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
up because for some reason they always

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
up because for some reason they always
seem<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.710> be<00:02:13.770> too<00:02:13.920> quiet<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:15.240> let's<00:02:15.420> try<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.660> one

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
seem to be too quiet so let's try it one

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
seem to be too quiet so let's try it one
more<00:02:15.870> time<00:02:15.960> see<00:02:16.260> how<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.470> sounds<00:02:20.060> perfect

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
more time see how that sounds perfect

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
more time see how that sounds perfect
all<00:02:21.660> right<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.350> after<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.430> can't

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
all right and so after that you can't

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.910 
all right and so after that you can't
use<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.480> again<00:02:24.780> unless<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.320> because<00:02:25.710> it'll

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
use a one again unless you because it'll

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.710 
use a one again unless you because it'll
mess<00:02:26.070> up<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.240> two<00:02:27.300> or

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
mess up this so you go to like a two or

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.220 
mess up this so you go to like a two or
let's<00:02:28.680> work<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:28.860> B<00:02:29.100> instead<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.580> b1<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> we

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
let's work with B instead of b1 so we

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.230 
let's work with B instead of b1 so we
use<00:02:31.350> some<00:02:31.560> kind<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.370> regular<00:02:32.550> old<00:02:32.760> drum

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
use some kind of just regular old drum

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.220 
use some kind of just regular old drum
pattern<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.830> put<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> kick<00:02:35.460> there<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.230> mean

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
pattern so just put a kick there I mean

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.170 
pattern so just put a kick there I mean
this<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:37.830> entirely<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.030> what
