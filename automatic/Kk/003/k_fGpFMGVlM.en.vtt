00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
chop off a little int like the ends of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.370 
chop off a little int like the ends of
the<00:01:36.869> curls<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.900> deep

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the curls you know and do a deep

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
the curls you know and do a deep
conditioner<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> end<00:01:45.630> will

look a little better but I still don't

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960

think<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> con<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.850> even<00:01:50.850> with

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the hair looks like after now the curl

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.229 
the hair looks like after now the curl
pattern<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.860> me<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.340> changed<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.880> little<00:03:13.940> bit

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
pattern for me it changed a little bit

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.210 
pattern for me it changed a little bit
but<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.720> didn't<00:03:14.930> change<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.350> bad<00:03:15.530> way<00:03:15.709> if

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
but it didn't change in a bad way if

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.680 
but it didn't change in a bad way if
you've<00:03:17.090> seen<00:03:17.420> my<00:03:17.600> original<00:03:18.410> video<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you've seen my original video of the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.320 
you've seen my original video of the
initial<00:03:21.049> install<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:22.100> curl<00:03:22.400> pack<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.910> curls

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
initial install the curl pack the curls

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.240 
initial install the curl pack the curls
were<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:24.080> think<00:03:24.440> they<00:03:24.650> were<00:03:24.709> more<00:03:24.920> like<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.160> a

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
were I think they were more like of a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.370 
were I think they were more like of a
spiral<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.000> for<00:03:26.150> me<00:03:26.269> these<00:03:26.510> these<00:03:26.989> are<00:03:27.170> more

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
spiral and for me these these are more

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.970 
spiral and for me these these are more
of<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:28.310> deep<00:03:29.000> wave<00:03:29.299> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.500> they<00:03:30.650> blew

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
of a deep wave kind of but they blew

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.960 
of a deep wave kind of but they blew
sinned<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.430> little<00:03:31.850> bit<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:34.549> don't<00:03:34.670> mind

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
sinned a little bit and I don't mind

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.990 
sinned a little bit and I don't mind
that<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.870> feel<00:03:36.799> like<00:03:37.010> people<00:03:37.580> who<00:03:37.880> have

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that I feel like people who have

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.350 
that I feel like people who have
naturally<00:03:38.450> curly<00:03:38.720> hair<00:03:39.400> their<00:03:40.400> hair<00:03:40.670> gets<00:03:40.970> up

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
naturally curly hair their hair gets up

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.590 
naturally curly hair their hair gets up
it<00:03:41.660> gets<00:03:41.959> frizzy<00:03:42.489> not<00:03:43.489> all<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.850> curls<00:03:44.150> are<00:03:44.390> the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
it gets frizzy not all the curls are the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.270 
it gets frizzy not all the curls are the
exact<00:03:44.900> same<00:03:44.989> someone<00:03:45.680> who's<00:03:45.860> there<00:03:46.040> somewhere

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
exact same someone who's there somewhere

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
exact same someone who's there somewhere
a<00:03:46.310> little<00:03:46.370> tighter<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.690> for<00:03:48.140> me<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.350> just

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
a little tighter it just for me it just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.509 
a little tighter it just for me it just
kind<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.709> looks<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.920> little<00:03:49.040> bit<00:03:49.250> more<00:03:49.400> natural

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
kind of looks a little bit more natural

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.610 
kind of looks a little bit more natural
so<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.239> don't<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.750> don't<00:03:50.900> mind<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.140> curl<00:03:51.320> pattern

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
so I don't I don't mind the curl pattern

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.479 
so I don't I don't mind the curl pattern
like<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.799> at<00:03:52.190> all

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
like this at all

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.729 
like this at all
I<00:03:52.790> probably<00:03:53.630> wouldn't<00:03:54.079> straighten<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.500> again

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
I probably wouldn't straighten it again

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.090 
I probably wouldn't straighten it again
only<00:03:54.890> because<00:03:55.280> although<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.390> was<00:03:56.570> not<00:03:57.019> hard<00:03:57.709> to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
only because although it was not hard to

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.550 
only because although it was not hard to
manage<00:03:58.600> with<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.720> curling<00:04:00.049> wand<00:04:00.260> with<00:04:01.160> the

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.170 
my hair because like I said I'm natural
and<00:04:23.780> I've<00:04:23.900> had<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:25.430> two<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> half

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and I've had this in for two and a half

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.879 
and I've had this in for two and a half
months

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
months

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.740 
months
and<00:04:27.009> it<00:04:27.159> is<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> full<00:04:27.580> Sun<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.270> don't<00:04:28.449> have<00:04:28.539> I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and it is a full Sun so I don't have I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.550 
and it is a full Sun so I don't have I
didn't<00:04:28.930> have<00:04:29.050> any<00:04:29.199> edges<00:04:30.099> left<00:04:30.219> out<00:04:30.599> but<00:04:31.599> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
didn't have any edges left out but the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.379 
didn't have any edges left out but the
closer<00:04:32.830> it's<00:04:33.189> a<00:04:33.250> little<00:04:33.520> harder<00:04:33.879> to<00:04:33.909> blend<00:04:34.150> now

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
closer it's a little harder to blend now

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.369 
closer it's a little harder to blend now
because<00:04:34.750> my<00:04:34.930> part<00:04:35.289> is<00:04:35.469> just<00:04:35.710> non-existent<00:04:36.090> and

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
because my part is just non-existent and

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.629 
because my part is just non-existent and
I<00:04:38.379> started<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:40.750> not<00:04:40.960> like<00:04:41.400> it

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
I started it's not like it

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.390 
I started it's not like it
well<00:04:43.360> braids<00:04:43.629> started<00:04:44.139> up<00:04:44.319> here<00:04:44.740> when<00:04:45.039> Irish

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
well braids started up here when Irish

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.390 
well braids started up here when Irish
initially<00:04:46.270> in<00:04:47.199> summer<00:04:47.710> Solon<00:04:48.129> and<00:04:48.280> now

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
initially in summer Solon and now

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.450 
initially in summer Solon and now
they're<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.729> way<00:04:49.120> back<00:04:49.599> here<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.199> I<00:04:50.469> have<00:04:51.099> a

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
they're like way back here so I have a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.459 
they're like way back here so I have a
ton<00:04:51.969> of<00:04:52.030> new<00:04:52.180> girls<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.840> it's<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.080> little<00:04:53.319> bit

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
ton of new girls so it's a little bit

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.119 
ton of new girls so it's a little bit
more<00:04:54.270> difficult<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.500> find<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.710> part<00:04:56.979> right

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
more difficult to find the part right

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:04.920 
more difficult to find the part right
here<00:04:57.840> but<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:59.469> know<00:04:59.590> the<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:02.819> closure<00:05:03.930> did

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
here but you know the the closure did

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.830 
here but you know the the closure did
not<00:05:05.110> shed<00:05:05.529> any<00:05:05.979> more<00:05:06.189> or<00:05:06.340> less<00:05:06.520> or<00:05:07.000> tangle<00:05:07.659> any

not shed any more or less or tangle any

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.080 
not shed any more or less or tangle any
more<00:05:08.020> or<00:05:08.080> less<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.349> rest<00:05:08.500> of<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.680> hair<00:05:09.090> if

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
more or less and the rest of the hair if

styling the hair and whatnot it went the
curl<00:05:23.110> pattern<00:05:23.139> still<00:05:23.830> matches<00:05:24.250> exactly<00:05:24.430> to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
curl pattern still matches exactly to

washing it the curl pattern never was

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.170 
washing it the curl pattern never was
any<00:05:32.919> looser<00:05:33.279> or<00:05:33.310> tighter<00:05:33.430> than<00:05:33.819> rest<00:05:34.000> of<00:05:34.120> the

hair it still blends perfectly now the

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.249 
hair it still blends perfectly now the
closure<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.719> will<00:05:37.990> say<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.719> is<00:05:40.779> I<00:05:41.020> mean<00:05:41.139> I

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
closure I will say and this is I mean I

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.439 
closure I will say and this is I mean I
know<00:05:41.319> there's<00:05:41.560> ways<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:41.770> can<00:05:42.009> fix<00:05:42.279> it<00:05:42.490> if<00:05:42.669> you

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
know there's ways you can fix it if you

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.760 
know there's ways you can fix it if you
know<00:05:43.599> you<00:05:43.659> are<00:05:44.849> familiar<00:05:45.849> with<00:05:46.060> closures<00:05:46.990> but

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
know you are familiar with closures but

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.490 
know you are familiar with closures but
I<00:05:48.129> think<00:05:48.400> she<00:05:48.639> over<00:05:49.089> bleached<00:05:49.449> the<00:05:49.870> nuts<00:05:50.110> and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
I think she over bleached the nuts and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.990 
I think she over bleached the nuts and
so<00:05:51.370> I<00:05:52.830> don't<00:05:53.830> know<00:05:54.009> I<00:05:54.069> could<00:05:54.460> have<00:05:54.550> just<00:05:54.699> died

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
so I don't know I could have just died

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.170 
so I don't know I could have just died
the<00:05:55.449> hair<00:05:55.689> that<00:05:56.339> the<00:05:57.339> bleached<00:05:57.610> touch<00:05:57.909> you

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
the hair that the bleached touch you

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.839 
the hair that the bleached touch you
know<00:05:58.360> or<00:05:58.650> darken<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.800> closure<00:06:00.039> but<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.520> did<00:06:00.729> and

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
know or darken the closure but I did and

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.429 
know or darken the closure but I did and
I<00:06:00.879> was<00:06:01.000> like<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.330> don't<00:06:01.539> think<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.080> want<00:06:02.259> to<00:06:02.289> deal

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
I was like I don't think I want to deal

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.510 
I was like I don't think I want to deal
with<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:02.740> it<00:06:02.979> looks<00:06:03.129> fine<00:06:03.370> for<00:06:03.520> now<00:06:03.669> so<00:06:05.250> yeah<00:06:06.250> I

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
just dealt with it but that's the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.619 
just dealt with it but that's the
closure<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.719> this<00:06:10.960> is<00:06:11.139> the<00:06:11.259> hair<00:06:11.529> after<00:06:12.629> two
