tonight's match USA 2 in Zeeland 0
I<00:01:32.050> was<00:01:33.050> pleased<00:01:33.350> obviously<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.010> get<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
I was pleased obviously to get the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.620 
I was pleased obviously to get the
result<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:34.790> needed<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.090> get<00:01:35.330> today<00:01:35.600> I

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
result that we needed to get today I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300 
result that we needed to get today I
think<00:01:35.870> going<00:01:36.200> into<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.590> third<00:01:36.830> game<00:01:37.040> leading

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
think going into the third game leading

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.760 
think going into the third game leading
the<00:01:37.520> group<00:01:37.700> was<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.940> priority<00:01:38.240> for<00:01:38.690> us<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:39.050> think

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the group was a priority for us I think

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.830 
the group was a priority for us I think
we<00:01:39.980> faced<00:01:40.730> a<00:01:40.880> team<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.300> was<00:01:41.420> really<00:01:41.570> well

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
we faced a team that was really well

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.840 
we faced a team that was really well
organized<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.740> were<00:01:43.130> good<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.550> counter

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
organized they were good on the counter

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.460 
organized they were good on the counter
and<00:01:43.940> they<00:01:44.030> had<00:01:44.150> some<00:01:44.330> good<00:01:44.479> athletes<00:01:44.990> they

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and they had some good athletes they

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.260 
and they had some good athletes they
worked<00:01:45.710> their<00:01:45.979> tails<00:01:46.280> off<00:01:46.550> for<00:01:46.610> 90<00:01:47.120> minutes

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
worked their tails off for 90 minutes

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.630 
worked their tails off for 90 minutes
really<00:01:48.080> difficult<00:01:48.590> team<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.950> break<00:01:49.130> down<00:01:49.340> I

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
really difficult team to break down I

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.370 
really difficult team to break down I
think<00:01:50.060> in<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.210> first<00:01:50.390> half<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:50.870> struggled<00:01:51.350> a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
think in the first half we struggled a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.830 
think in the first half we struggled a
little<00:01:51.500> bit<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:52.520> identify<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> spaces<00:01:53.810> that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
little bit to identify the spaces that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.450 
little bit to identify the spaces that
we<00:01:54.050> need<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.410> do<00:01:54.560> attack<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.100> think<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.370> were

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
we need to do attack I think we were

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.130 
we need to do attack I think we were
trying<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.729> jam<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.090> ball<00:01:56.270> up<00:01:56.570> we're<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> little

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
trying to jam the ball up we're a little

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.660 
trying to jam the ball up we're a little
narrow<00:01:57.440> in<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.710> first<00:01:57.950> half<00:01:58.190> once<00:01:58.460> we<00:01:58.550> were

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
narrow in the first half once we were

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.950 
narrow in the first half once we were
able<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.940> find<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.300> width<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.600> little<00:01:59.630> bit

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
able to find the width a little bit

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.240 
able to find the width a little bit
towards<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.290> end<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.590> first<00:02:00.800> step<00:02:01.040> and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
towards the end on the first step and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.560 
towards the end on the first step and
then<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.580> second<00:02:01.880> half<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.180> think<00:02:02.210> things

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
then in the second half I think things

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.800 
then in the second half I think things
started<00:02:02.900> open<00:02:03.259> up<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:04.270> little<00:02:05.270> better<00:02:05.479> so

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
started open up a little better so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.690 
started open up a little better so
overall<00:02:06.440> obviously<00:02:06.979> very<00:02:07.190> pleased<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
overall obviously very pleased with the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.730 
overall obviously very pleased with the
result<00:02:08.030> overall<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.840> thought<00:02:09.140> our<00:02:09.259> team<00:02:09.500> played

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
result overall I thought our team played

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.470 
result overall I thought our team played
really<00:02:09.920> well<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.490> was<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.030> glad<00:02:11.120> with<00:02:11.360> all

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
really well I was really glad with all

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.240 
really well I was really glad with all
of<00:02:11.570> our<00:02:11.690> team<00:02:11.840> effort<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.560> thought<00:02:12.950> everyone

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
of our team effort I thought everyone

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.740 
of our team effort I thought everyone
did<00:02:13.280> their<00:02:13.550> part<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.360> was<00:02:14.450> really<00:02:14.570> happy

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.150 
did their part and I was really happy
with<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.050> result<00:02:15.380> because<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.040> one

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
with the result because it's just one

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.199 
with the result because it's just one
step<00:02:16.340> forward<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.790> what<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.030> came<00:02:17.150> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
step forward of what we came to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.570 
step forward of what we came to
accomplish<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.350> crowd<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.920> good<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
for the next two years and we've got

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.580 
for the next two years and we've got
four<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.000> them<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.750> us<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.080> camp<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
four of them in here with us in camp and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.750 
four of them in here with us in camp and
I<00:02:33.620> thought<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.950> did<00:02:34.130> really<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.519> well

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
I thought they did really really well

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160 
I thought they did really really well
tonight<00:02:35.269> they<00:02:35.420> didn't<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:35.810> hold<00:02:35.989> their<00:02:36.140> own

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
tonight they didn't just hold their own

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.350 
tonight they didn't just hold their own
I<00:02:36.320> thought<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:36.769> changed<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.220> game<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.120> for

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
I thought they changed the game so for

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.640 
I thought they changed the game so for
someone<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.900> come<00:02:39.050> into<00:02:39.230> their<00:02:39.410> first

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
someone to come into their first

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.080 
someone to come into their first
international<00:02:40.310> game<00:02:40.519> against<00:02:40.910> good

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.550 
international game against good
competition<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.870> go<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.170> change<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.530> game

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
competition and go and change the game

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.770 
competition and go and change the game
it<00:02:43.310> says<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.549> lot<00:02:43.730> about<00:02:43.790> their<00:02:44.150> character<00:02:44.330> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
