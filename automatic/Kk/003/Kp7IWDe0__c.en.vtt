00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:27.910
 one would worsen the sun, which is kind to 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:33.769
 heat that brings ribbon the sun illuminates 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:39.140
 was being challenged by evil coming from 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:42.140
 north than the northern moment to prove 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.350
 to the sun he was much more 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:53.020
 powerful way to force people to 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:59.480
 doing the things the sun said did not 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:03.910
 it is not out of violence it is out of love and evil 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.580
 within the nokia is not by my strength 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.179
 they chose a man who was 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.310
 walking on the ground 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:18.709
 this man carried a package over 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.140
 so in the north wind said you want 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.869
 believe that with my strength 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.130
 I go there and take off this man's coat. 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.239
 in a minute and it's not for love it's for 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.110
 hatred and by the force and violence of 

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:37.759
 sun said 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.200
 the experiment then the bad north wind 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 came and began to blow furiously on 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.380
 that poor man 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 and when the wind started its side well 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 The man then held his coat and 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.850
 wind blew stronger still giving 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.660
 pull off his coat and the man neither 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.450
 the stronger the wind but it 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.830
 self hugged and loss of job if you 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.470
 same 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.490
 and the more the wind blew over it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.960
 he wore his coat and the middle made so much 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.480
 force 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.690
 so much strength that he was even able to take the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.070
 man down but could not start 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.740
 his coat 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.780
 only then this event 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.270
 Do you want to see the world? 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.990
 I get it easy and the man was 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.320
 there one shivering the wind had 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:54.050
 been very cold 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.870
 the man was practically frozen 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.140
 Then the sun began to send its 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.090
 soft rays 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.990
 then it was warming that man's body 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:14.130
 and he was as white as snow 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.670
 he who was frozen was feeling 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.210
 Blood circulates again through your 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 naked body and then feeling a nice 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.970
 a warm feeling of warmth and the sun 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.170
 that man kept happening 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 the man began to thank for that 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:45.320
 sun that the axia and only continues heating and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:50.780
 he felt already in good condition he took the 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.750
 his cloak and started loading it in his 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.640
 hand 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:02.120
 then the sun caused the sea wind 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:07.360
 from the north that lovingly with love was 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:13.970
 easier to get things of the person 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:19.160
 than using violence and evil that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.990
 can resist the power of love sir 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.450
 jesus when he spoke with us he said 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.080
 Pray for those who abuse 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.500
 events follow in drawings that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.530
 cruzmaltin comes 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.000
 that you may be the son of your father who 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:45.190
 he is in heaven because he makes his 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.660
 sun rises on good and bad and your 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.660
 good rain thinks about the just and the unjust 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.560
 the person when he is challenged when he is 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.950
 confronted 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.550
 She also confronts her, too. 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:08.200
 treat acne but when the person is 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.840
 called a protected person she too 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.450
 love 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.260
 if you love you will be bush 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.750
 if you diary you will be the devil if 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.600
 You serve your like you too 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.830
 will be served 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.900
 if you act well with other people 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.970
 other people also acted well with 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.460
 you but if you act badly on others 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.460
 They also acted badly with you. 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.550
 I hear saying the word of God the Lord 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:51.740
 jesus should 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:55.490
 But I say unto you, That ye resist not 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.240
 but if anyone who hits the face 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.730
 also offer you the other is the 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.590
 I want to sue you and take you 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.990
 the wide garment and also the cape 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:15.820
 and if anyone is forced to walk a 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:21.230
 mile go with it two of the hot request 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:27.950
 and did not tell you who wants you 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:31.520
 Loan, love your enemies or 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:36.800
 drawings that the slanderers do well 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:41.560
 types hate and pray for that 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.560
 mistreat and own chase 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:48.190
 confirming the words of the Lord Jesus 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.380
 the apostle saint paul wrote in the letter 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:55.810
 to the Romans chapter 12 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:59.320

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.550
 is hungry in the area to eat 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.820
 if you have acres to drink because 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.340
 doing this to set the coals of fire 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:15.930
 on your head and do not let yourself 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:19.030
 to overcome evil but overcome evil as well 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.100
 you from the darkness you are the son of 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.980
 light 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.530
 You're not a born-again person. 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.140
 noise of weapons to love 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.570
 why you were not created in the image and 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:36.250
 resemblance of satan but you went 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:43.050
