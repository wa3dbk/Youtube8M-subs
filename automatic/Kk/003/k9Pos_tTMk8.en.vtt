00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's some kind of asked to pass the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.349 
that's some kind of asked to pass the
time

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
time

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.700 
time
so<00:01:29.359> I'm<00:01:29.450> thinking<00:01:29.509> about<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> dinner<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.590> do

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
so I'm thinking about the dinner we do

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.200 
so I'm thinking about the dinner we do
some<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.009> that'd<00:01:31.340> be<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.759> folding<00:01:32.600> chair

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
some like that'd be a folding chair

couch<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.539> people<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.219> think<00:01:37.310> maybe

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
couch with people on so I think maybe

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.029 
couch with people on so I think maybe
the<00:01:38.240> lack<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.659> pants<00:01:39.109> be<00:01:39.319> sort<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.679> final

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
the lack of pants be sort of a final

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.330 
the lack of pants be sort of a final
reveal<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:41.750> take<00:01:42.109> it<00:01:42.289> outta<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.100> did
