00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
side we noticed that the first

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
difference between the two is the volume

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.500 
difference between the two is the volume
rocker<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> look<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
rocker so if you look over here on the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
rocker so if you look over here on the
right<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:44.040> button<00:00:44.399> well<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.879> two

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
right we have one button well it's two

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
right we have one button well it's two
buttons<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.079> connected<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> over<00:00:47.010> here

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
buttons but it's connected and over here

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.490 
buttons but it's connected and over here
we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.370> separated<00:00:47.820> buttons<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> volume

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
we have separated buttons for the volume

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
we have separated buttons for the volume
and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> iPod<00:00:50.309> Touch<00:00:50.579> 4th<00:00:50.910> generation<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and the iPod Touch 4th generation is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.010 
and the iPod Touch 4th generation is
skinnier<00:00:52.410> too<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.250> notice<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
skinnier too you can notice that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.270 
skinnier too you can notice that
especially<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.949> hand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
especially when you have it in your hand

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
especially when you have it in your hand
so<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.850> definitely<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.420> big<00:00:57.660> difference

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so that's definitely a big difference

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.069 
so that's definitely a big difference
and<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> iPod

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and if we look on the back the iPod

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.250 
and if we look on the back the iPod
Touch<00:01:01.289> 4th<00:01:01.620> generation<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:03.260> flatter

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
generation those are all really good

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
generation those are all really good
features<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.060> too<00:02:03.240> bad<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
features that it's really too bad that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
features that it's really too bad that
this<00:02:03.869> iPod<00:02:04.290> doesn't<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.189> again

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
this iPod doesn't have it but then again

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.900 
this iPod doesn't have it but then again
I<00:02:05.700> mean<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.899> did<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.500> come<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> camera

so first things off I'm gonna go to a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330 
so first things off I'm gonna go to a
website<00:02:27.390> right<00:02:27.690> now<00:02:27.960> let's<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.560> open<00:02:29.070> up<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
website right now let's just open up the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.770 
website right now let's just open up the
internet<00:02:29.490> browsers<00:02:30.270> here

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
internet browsers here

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710 
internet browsers here
and<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.100> go<00:02:32.250> they're<00:02:33.030> both<00:02:33.210> on<00:02:33.390> helping

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and here we go they're both on helping

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.560 
and here we go they're both on helping
with<00:02:33.840> tech<00:02:34.020> actually<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.570> actually

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
with tech actually kind of actually

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.420 
with tech actually kind of actually
surprising<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:38.130> we'll<00:02:38.340> both<00:02:38.670> go<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
surprising but now we'll both go to a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.550 
surprising but now we'll both go to a
website<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.640> each<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.300> will<00:02:42.510> go<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> mod

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
website on each of them will go to mod

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.080 
website on each of them will go to mod
my<00:02:43.830> eye<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.830> typed<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.280> mod<00:02:47.490> my<00:02:47.670> eye<00:02:47.700> on

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
my eye so I have typed in mod my eye on

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
my eye so I have typed in mod my eye on
each<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.510> these<00:02:48.600> iPods<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.290> I'll<00:02:49.410> try<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
each of these iPods and I'll try to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.680 
each of these iPods and I'll try to
click<00:02:49.920> go<00:02:50.160> at<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.490> exact<00:02:50.790> same<00:02:51.030> time<00:02:51.360> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
click go at the exact same time and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.470 
click go at the exact same time and
we'll<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.830> which<00:02:53.010> one<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> faster<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
we'll see which one is faster so it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.720 
we'll see which one is faster so it
looks<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.900> clicked<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.710> close<00:02:56.580> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
looks like I clicked it pretty close to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.460 
looks like I clicked it pretty close to
the<00:02:56.820> same<00:02:56.970> time<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.450> iPod<00:02:57.990> Touch<00:02:58.170> 4th

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the same time in the iPod Touch 4th

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
the same time in the iPod Touch 4th
generation<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:59.130> much<00:02:59.790> faster<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.720> can

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
generation is much faster and as you can

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.380 
generation is much faster and as you can
tell<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> already<00:03:01.680> done<00:03:02.070> ready<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.030> scroll

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
tell it is already done ready to scroll

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.700 
tell it is already done ready to scroll
through<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.900> everything<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> iPod

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
through it and everything in the iPod

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.610 
through it and everything in the iPod
Touch<00:03:04.860> 2nd<00:03:05.250> generation<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:06.210> still<00:03:06.620> loading

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
Touch 2nd generation is still loading

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.690 
Touch 2nd generation is still loading
and<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.860> looks<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.520> take

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
and it looks like it's going to take

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.330 
and it looks like it's going to take
quite<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.970> bit<00:03:09.150> more<00:03:09.360> time<00:03:09.660> actually<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.800> that's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
quite a bit more time actually so that's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.890 
quite a bit more time actually so that's
a<00:03:11.460> quick<00:03:11.610> comparison<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.480> internet

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
a quick comparison of the internet

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.950 
a quick comparison of the internet
browser<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.800> both<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.690> ipod<00:03:15.930> touch

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
browser so they both are the ipod touch

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.110 
browser so they both are the ipod touch
is<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> little<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.740> slower<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.550> but

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
is a little bit slower on the right but

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.780 
is a little bit slower on the right but
the<00:03:18.840> left<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.440> definitely<00:03:19.770> much<00:03:20.250> faster

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the left one is definitely much faster

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.000 
the left one is definitely much faster
as<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.450> tell<00:03:21.570> even<00:03:21.750> closing<00:03:22.290> apps<00:03:22.470> is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
as you can tell even closing apps is

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.820 
as you can tell even closing apps is
much<00:03:23.310> faster<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.810> iPod<00:03:25.230> Touch<00:03:25.500> 4th

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
much faster on the iPod Touch 4th

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.960 
much faster on the iPod Touch 4th
generation<00:03:26.420> versus<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.570> ipod<00:03:28.080> touch<00:03:28.110> 2g<00:03:28.970> so

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
generation versus the ipod touch 2g so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.370 
generation versus the ipod touch 2g so
another<00:03:30.210> thing<00:03:30.480> I'm<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.810> try<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.990> open

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
jump and seeing which one loads up

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.400 
jump and seeing which one loads up
faster<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:42.210> you<00:03:42.690> know<00:03:42.720> see<00:03:43.260> the

faster and just you know see the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.720 
faster and just you know see the
comparison<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.070> then<00:03:44.220> I'll<00:03:44.340> show<00:03:44.490> you<00:03:44.520> guys

comparison and then I'll show you guys

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.130 
comparison and then I'll show you guys
the<00:03:44.790> different<00:03:45.300> displays<00:03:45.690> I'll<00:03:45.930> show<00:03:46.050> you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140

the different displays I'll show you
guys<00:03:46.290> Retina<00:03:46.710> Display<00:03:47.070> versus<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.630> just

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
guys Retina Display versus the just

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.740 
guys Retina Display versus the just
normal<00:03:49.320> display<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> ipod<00:03:50.310> touch<00:03:50.340> 2g<00:03:50.910> so

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
normal display on the ipod touch 2g so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.290 
normal display on the ipod touch 2g so
we'll<00:03:51.900> open<00:03:52.020> up<00:03:52.260> an<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.530> jump<00:03:52.800> here<00:03:53.150> there<00:03:54.150> we

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
we'll open up an in jump here there we

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.360 
we'll open up an in jump here there we
go<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.530> tell<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.770> left<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.160> does

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
go as you can tell the left one does

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.430 
go as you can tell the left one does
look<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.640> little<00:03:56.760> nicer<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.630> does<00:03:57.870> load

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
look a little nicer and it does load

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.950 
look a little nicer and it does load
quite<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> bit<00:03:59.250> faster<00:03:59.820> I'm<00:04:00.300> really<00:04:00.570> surprised

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
quite a bit faster I'm really surprised

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.370 
quite a bit faster I'm really surprised
how<00:04:01.110> slow<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.740> second<00:04:02.130> generation<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.760> now

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
how slow the second generation is now

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
how slow the second generation is now
there's<00:04:04.380> quite<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.680> big<00:04:05.010> difference<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.790> it's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
there's quite a big difference and it's

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.260 
there's quite a big difference and it's
really<00:04:06.780> kind<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.710> disappointing<00:04:08.459> now<00:04:08.880> looking

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
really kind of disappointing now looking

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.270 
really kind of disappointing now looking

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
at these two I mean the one on the left

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.850 
at these two I mean the one on the left

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
and the one on the right is still

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.409 
and the one on the right is still
loading<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.130> do<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:20.580> know<00:04:20.820> what's<00:04:21.000> going<00:04:21.060> on

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
so this is a quick comparison again of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.560 
so this is a quick comparison again of
opening<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.530> game<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.190> again<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.120> taking<00:04:30.300> a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
opening the game and again it's taking a

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.710 
opening the game and again it's taking a
long<00:04:30.780> time<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.440> load<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.850> now<00:04:33.270> I'm<00:04:33.420> going<00:04:33.630> to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
long time to load so now I'm going to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.030 
long time to load so now I'm going to
try<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.900> show<00:04:34.170> you<00:04:34.200> guys<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.650> difference

try to show you guys the difference

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040 
try to show you guys the difference

compared to over here on the 4th
generation<00:05:02.670> iPod<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:05.040> that's<00:05:05.340> sort<00:05:05.640> of<00:05:05.760> my

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110

generation iPod so that's sort of my
look<00:05:07.110> at<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.590> if<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.830> look<00:05:08.010> at<00:05:08.160> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
writing I mean I'm not sure if you guys

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.710 
writing I mean I'm not sure if you guys
can<00:05:10.920> tell<00:05:10.950> but<00:05:11.400> there's<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.000> huge<00:05:12.420> difference

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
when I hold them together this these

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.280 
when I hold them together this these
this<00:05:15.060> writing<00:05:15.420> over<00:05:15.600> here<00:05:15.780> almost<00:05:15.960> looks

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
this writing over here almost looks

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.560 
this writing over here almost looks
great<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:17.040> me<00:05:17.190> now<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:18.120> writing<00:05:18.390> over

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
great to me now and the writing over

this was requested on this channel so I

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.400 
this was requested on this channel so I
decided<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.210> know<00:05:51.270> why<00:05:51.570> not<00:05:51.750> make<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.050> video

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410

I'm<00:05:52.680> sort<00:05:52.950> of<00:05:53.010> interested<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.580> see<00:05:53.760> which<00:05:53.940> ones

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
I'm sort of interested to see which ones

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.080 
I'm sort of interested to see which ones
are<00:05:54.270> faster<00:05:54.800> maybe<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:56.280> jailbreak<00:05:56.640> does<00:05:56.910> have

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
are faster maybe the jailbreak does have

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.110 
are faster maybe the jailbreak does have
a<00:05:57.120> little<00:05:57.540> bit<00:05:57.720> of<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:58.620> maybe<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.850> slowing

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
a little bit of a maybe it is slowing

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.630 
a little bit of a maybe it is slowing
like<00:06:00.420> down<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.110> ipod<00:06:01.440> touch<00:06:01.470> 2g<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:02.130> little<00:06:02.430> bit

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
like down the ipod touch 2g a little bit

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.420 
like down the ipod touch 2g a little bit
but<00:06:03.180> really<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:04.260> guys<00:06:04.410> can<00:06:04.740> tell<00:06:04.980> that<00:06:05.280> the
