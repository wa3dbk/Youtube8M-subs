00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 project a bit singular for once 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 it's not your record for you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 Christmas and brings together a lot of artists 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 the universe of disney through a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 album and about fifteen titles 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 exactly it's actually it's home 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.980
 lunar disc the one that had the idea of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 this project that got closer to Disney and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.539
 for the first time in the world 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.820
 proof of history had this idea of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.510
 revisit finally it's his big 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.460
 classic selections get bogged down 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.189
 all what one day my prince will come 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 directly that all generations 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:21.270
 were able to listen in loop that small 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.890
 and the big ones adore revisiting his big 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.210
 classics and it was not a thin 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.560
 business is a project that we are 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.479
 with a lot of humility because this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 are great disney songs has 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.390
 always had a real rigor a face 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 to his choice of songs in the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.780
 composition in the choice of 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.280
 interpreters therefore reclaim his 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 songs it's not an easy thing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 so what gave you to you 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.320
 he wants to participate in this project 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.189
 that it is the return to childhood and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 what made you want 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.740
 to embody the pinocchio song the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 back to childhood 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.329
 yes I believe that first of all when 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.920
 one is an artist finally that's what 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.689
 we have in common with the world of 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.479
 children and the world of artists that's 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:04.009
 this ability to dream to marvel 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.360
 things to finally when one 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.560
 is in the creation and that's what 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.850
 finally brings us closer to the names of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.950
 artists and the children's world so 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.630
 nothing for that me it attracted me 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.030
 also found in my own projects 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.760
 personal inference from the tales of 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.209
 Celtic legends especially so I have 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.819
 a passion for for that and then I 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.220
 am also a disney child i have 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.080
 watched in a loop his classics 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.390
 when I was younger and what 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.060
 I loved deeply it was precisely 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.010
 the fact that all one is 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.769
 inseparable the music is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.880
 inseparable from all and packages 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.870
 so we find you or so what 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.220
 is pretty amazing is that it's very 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.450
 eclectic a fortnight ago 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.670
 artists almost twenty 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.489
 besides jennifer thomas dutronc ben 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.110
 uncle soul garou alex beaupain all 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.610
 these people actually have wanted to 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.810
 participate in the project 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.069
 all these people want to participate in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.510
 project know that it's very very 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.690
 eclectic there is something for everyone 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.970
 there are artists precisely horizons 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.340
 diverse and varied and that's what creates 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.130
 also the interest of this project is 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.609
 everyone has reclaimed his song 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.810
 favorite in his way so after that's 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 that's complicated too, it's 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.430
 knows so much his songs we can 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.840
 not too much either the oases and yes by 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.930
 example I chose a song that is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.640
 to me I liked this obsolete side a little 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.060
 in the first disney the first 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.250
 songs 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.109
 snow white one day my prince will come 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.730
 pinocchio the dead of the thirties 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.310
 40s besides this song that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.989
 I chose or a us open star so the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.730
 canton pinocchio song caught the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.930
 lucky star was awarded at the Oscars this 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.519
 is one of the most beautiful songs of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.359
 movies and it's a very sweet song and 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.730
 interpreter because she is in the 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.530
 acute because it makes one dream his sails 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.510
 and gus and sees her swell princess 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.340
 so it's a bit difficult and you can 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.810
 not lower the tone sing lower 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.799
 because it's more dreaming in 20 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.389
 second what we do not have a lot of 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.650
 time we will talk about you in the process of 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.299
 this zem collective project had plenty of 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.910
 turn and do you the olympia hall 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.820
 packed 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.040
 you are already writing the next album yes 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.260
 I'm already hurting will actually play 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.500
 never really stops writing 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.840
 and it's true that it's been ten years since I 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220
 do this job in recent years while 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.930
 finally accelerated 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.820
 paradoxically what I had to start 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 quite dazzling but it's true that these 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.050
 last few years of course 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.299
 with the Breton album 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.880
 and then over the water that met 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.190
 also an incredible success a lot 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.970
 finally made a lot of concerts 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.280
 on the roads 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.980
 to meet the public and the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.690
 it's true that I love this 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.280
 idea of continuing to write a disc in 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.690
 being on stage and never really 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.550
 stop then you will make us a 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.840
