00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.340
 who wants to fry really good would need 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.519
 An oil water is heated to 200 degrees 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 looks 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.980
 you are like that too 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 are also on the right side if not 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 investing more euros and buying more bucks 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 you the quiet times times the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 fried potatoes we can guess 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.630
 look at the toothpick instance bubbling 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630
 it gets hot enough 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:45.920
 - the potato cut them lay it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:49.870
 put it into the roast then 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 single especially and will be nice and brown 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.870
 so we get a nice course 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:12.440
 Cyclists can and will do later 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.440
 the topics 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.860
 Here we see that the fried potatoes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.930
 already got a little color 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.910
 now they can turn around and the other one 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.010
 side roast golden brown 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.040
 that's how it looks from the wheel 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.280
 or unilaterally beautiful golden brown now 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.430
 even that side broke out nicely 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.330
 what I always do then a few ready 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.420
 hit the side you can get there 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.090
 few new trains which then bratkartoffeln 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.619
 again nice to advise so 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.720
 I also have a larger amount in 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.820
 a relatively small pan prepared 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.900
 as we do not see these potatoes 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.880
 very firm 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.890
 but by having the beautiful crust 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.060
 they will not fall after that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.869
 apart and then you can do it too 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.869
 continue to turn and turn 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.350
 so is the fried potatoes from 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.360
 expect both sides 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.450
 Now I can add the onions 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:29.360
 and practice everything over and over again 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.220
 should be just glassy probably not 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 get black and for every one of mine 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 taste
