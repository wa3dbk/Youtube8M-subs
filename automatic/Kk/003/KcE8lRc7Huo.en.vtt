00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello and welcome to the grounds 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.819
 mixu tauriel today we're going 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.970
 see how to connect a device 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.460
 bluetooth to neutral windows 8 for that we 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.549
 goes into the settings of his phone 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.520
 portable and one looks for the folder or 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.109
 the tab or the connectivity icon 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.279
 or following networks on the type of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.010
 phone where you are 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 from there you activate the touching end 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 above once club or touch is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900
 activated you can do a search 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 networks 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 if it does not work you never know because 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 that I'm on a machine 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 Virtual 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 it can change configuration may and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 no in a word there is not too much 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 balance difference smiled up 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 right we go on the gear 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 settings we sell low to change them 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 pc settings and tab 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 devices here then me there are 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 virtual touch control to you have it 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.449
 maybe not basic where you have it if 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 you do not have it at the worst you do then 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 add a device what I 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.640
 am on a virtual machine i am 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 on my mac and maybe it's different 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 the configuration for you that's on a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.439
 pure windows but in theory the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 configuration I think is the same so 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 if you have the usb basic controllers 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.229
 good luck it's all good stones 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.970

 72 30 ares I did the test on a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 old phone voluntarily rather 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 than to do that on a samsung or iphone 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.369

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.680
