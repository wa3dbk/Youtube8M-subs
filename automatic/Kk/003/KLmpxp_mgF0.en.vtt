and I've been I don't understand Korean
so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.759> trying<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> figure<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
so I was trying to figure out what it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.980 
so I was trying to figure out what it
said<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.189> says<00:01:32.400> something<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:33.000> fan

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
said and it says something about fan

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.649 
said and it says something about fan
staff<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.650> English<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> read<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
staff in English and if you read the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.219 
staff in English and if you read the
back<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.470> says<00:01:37.890> it'll<00:01:38.520> minh<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:39.600> means<00:01:39.840> name

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
back it says it'll minh which means name

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.370 
back it says it'll minh which means name
and<00:01:40.790> then<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> clean<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.899> exit<00:01:43.290> which
