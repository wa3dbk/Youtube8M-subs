00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello dear craft friends we 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.470
 surely our sorenson will hear again 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.290
 a request for fragrances 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.120
 it 's because we have the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 Quadcopter irritate that would be 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 Farther on, it works 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 everything with our sticks we have 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 you best we already drawn the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.760
 data arrive but now have that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.670
 Whole still connected to the engine 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.520
 that one really with the joystick now 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.050
 these 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.070
 move this construction back and forth 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.670
 can 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.350
 First of all, I just had to 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.960
 make it so to speak if 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.410
 calibrate his son and then switch 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.410
 I'll go first 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.360
 so are already the motors are active 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 Now you can see here which 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.980
 any sensor sensor values â€‹â€‹here 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 change if you construct the whole 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.570
 moved and now just the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 Using joystick goes a bit away 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 I do control button then press 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 is the engine ever a stand 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570
 gas 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.850
 the neutral position in the exemption 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.300
 let the judge not correct 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.530
 that means I always have to 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.320
 still a little hold the thing 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.970
 does not turn completely straight ahead though 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.310
 what I show it which at standgas 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.990
 Make and move on the sticks ago 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.490
 then I really want that too 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.490
 already in the head move 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.880
 So everything is fine 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.710
 try by hand a bit 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 to balance out what the cheap there still 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 not completely correct 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.200
 they come neither in proportion 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.470
 share up to the swing still so 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.030
 you have to correct that is hard 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 try it but we can get it 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 and that's why there's only that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.600
 next video again the thing 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720
 hopefully right in the balance 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.360
 is held and you get the swede here 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.610
 then move into the creation 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.040
 stands still that was it for then 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.810
 alredy today 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.870
 we hope you enjoyed it and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.770
 if you like it then subscribe 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 simple and social 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.420
 also in the future interesting videos eg 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.220
 about the quadcopter but also about 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.810
 doing other projects by the way 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.150
 Bye and see you soon 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.660
 our remote control for the quadcopter 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:14.239
 and there's a 24 l 01 in it 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.860
 By the way, the 1968 workstation, by the way 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.510
 I like what some people think 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.720
 Throw away that was on the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.190
 desk-stand 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.080
 248 is supposed to be the cursor that can 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.390
 you move up in the lower left to the right 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.150
 then the calibration data will be too 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.610
 nicely stored in the room 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.310
 300 paper black would like to assure 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.310
 and you have easily again
