00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.719
 greater 72 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:16.440
 wow wow what's wrong remedies today I'm with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.300
 a question geek geek a question 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
 super geek to you it will seem 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 comment it say geek there with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 uppercase because good it turns out that it does 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 little was talking to a friend I do not know 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.840
 how the fuck did the issue come out I think 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.030
 was playing the dann of war which is a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.530
 video game of warhammer by pure 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.010
 chance was testing a 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 modification and good came out the subject of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.079
 who would win all the factions of the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 universe of star wars other factions 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.969
 of the warhammer universe 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 there are people who still do not know what 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 are each of these things that is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.960
 I basically do not consider it freaky 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.519
 but general culture star wars you know 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.399
 the movies that came out in the years 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.070
 70 and 80 and that we now have with all 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 the episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 and now star 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 wars in I say no 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.729
 Disney wants to make episodes 7 8 and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 9 so let's see how that goes and then 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 warhammer something so old that I do not know if 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.110
 dates back to the late 70's and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.550
 in the early 80's as well as my 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.229
 videos are think are more or less 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.789
 known in the culture in what they are 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.679
 the warhammer forums so I guess 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.710
 that these will be quite interesting 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:26.100
 is not the question is who would win if the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.470
 galaxy of star wars or the galaxy of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.119
 warhammer 40,000 faced as if 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 all the bad guys in a galaxy are 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.190
 unite with the good ones and the other 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.920
 also and they will face each other and the truth is 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.229
 that the debate has been intensely 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 heated up I more or less defending the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.880
 world of star wars and he more or less 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.690
 defending the world from warhammer 40,000 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 but 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.770
 talking about cruisers destroy 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.900
 planets that if who wins the infantry 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.940
 I do not know what dicks you will know them 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 space marines that I have besides game 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.400
 clicks of the space marine greater seven 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.530
 games 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.570
 faced against you already know that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.120
 cannon meat dressed in star white 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.550
 wars who would win good you will see that it is 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.619
 quite interesting to talk about all of that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.240
 I'm not going to comment in depth 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.130
 all this because I really am going to 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.230
 to make pretty freaky are all those 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.590
 I left things in the past, something that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.050
 like to comment by the way 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.700
 before my shelves and everything 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.440
 had there was half was of star wars 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.360
 until one day in 14 or 15 years in this 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.940
 that I went into the room and I said look 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.459
 your fucking mother this seems like a fucking 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.230
 museum so I picked 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.360
 almost everything and got into 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.819
 drawers and what I still have left is a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 star wars poster episode 2 that the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.610
 I really do not feel especially 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.730
 proud of him but he 's a nice 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.110
 I remember because it was given to me by a friend 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.910
 that now I do not know the truth where pussy 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.140
 he lives because he has I do not know if he had a 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.130
 Spanish mother and a Brazilian father 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.780
 he was born in south africa his fucking mother 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.120
 so I'll leave the question for you 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.040
 that you answer who would win the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.069
 world of star wars or the warhammer world 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.140
 40,000 I have a scientific interest and 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.390
 empirical for knowing your answers 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.879
 although surely instead of really 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.640
 I really want to think about the Canary Islands 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.620
 you are going to say a your favorite which 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.190
 It will also be quite interesting 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.430
 so by making a stop then these 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.830
 typical of this thing also virgin not 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.140
 I know as pure experiment so nothing 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.260
 until next time to answer the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.260
 comments 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.110
