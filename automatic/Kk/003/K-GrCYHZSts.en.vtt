00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.090 
I need to stretch my horizons I do know
that<00:03:37.510> I've<00:03:37.780> been<00:03:37.900> drawing<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.560> long<00:03:38.800> time

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
that I've been drawing for a long time

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.650 
that I've been drawing for a long time
but<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.370> haven't<00:03:39.730> exactly<00:03:39.790> practiced

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
but I haven't exactly practiced

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.960

sequential storytelling for a long time

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.870

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
about the ghetto camera so I'm using my

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.240 
about the ghetto camera so I'm using my

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
phone to record these videos which is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.740 
phone to record these videos which is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
why they're kind of shaky they might

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.010 
why they're kind of shaky they might
even<00:04:57.870> be<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.110> little<00:04:58.170> laggy<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.800> have<00:04:58.980> no<00:04:59.130> idea

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
even be a little laggy I have no idea

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.330 
even be a little laggy I have no idea
but<00:05:01.020> obviously<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.800> isn't<00:05:02.010> going<00:05:02.250> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
but obviously this isn't going to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.270 
but obviously this isn't going to
sustain<00:05:02.850> if<00:05:03.600> these<00:05:03.840> YouTube<00:05:04.230> channels<00:05:04.650> go

sustain if these YouTube channels go

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.330 
sustain if these YouTube channels go
pretty<00:05:05.730> well<00:05:05.820> or<00:05:06.330> this<00:05:06.630> channel<00:05:07.110> rather<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:08.070> it

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
pretty well or this channel rather if it

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.050 
pretty well or this channel rather if it
actually<00:05:08.610> succeeds<00:05:09.420> or<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:10.500> know<00:05:11.060> garnishes

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060
