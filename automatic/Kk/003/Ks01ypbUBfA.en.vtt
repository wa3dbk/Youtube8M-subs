00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.090
 So today we are at 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.199
 for my sixth mode vehicle is so 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.630
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
 vehicle a little bit special so this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 vehicle is called the buggy spes so 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 first of all before the video starts 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 I wanted to thank my friend there the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.769
 geek 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 so he passed me this gameplay this is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 really a vehicle steed and so his 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.180
 string will be in the description of course 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.059
 it's going to go for a quick tour 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 this vehicle is really stylish there are 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.059
 stuff where he did a little bit badly I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.289
 find but there is too cool is really 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 well done kind when he climbed in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.219
 the car was a little bad but 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.800
 otherwise it's really stylish so what 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.500
 vehicle really wears its name there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.990
 is pretty powerful level speed 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.350
 that's it and it's really a 100% vehicle 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.850
 fashion and it's really stylish so I 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.390
 really wanted to thank my friend there 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.370
 the geek 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.780
 so here it rolls a little on the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.140
 Doubs was waiting for him we will recover 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.500
 law 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.720
 maybe it's a little bit better 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.110
 but who can not even drive to afp 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 really applaud but this vehicle he 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.170
 really makes me think of a space buggy 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.940
 a little piece of space see after he 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 there are not great stuff there is 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.000
 not extraordinary stuff either 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.310
 on it but if it is really well done 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.050
