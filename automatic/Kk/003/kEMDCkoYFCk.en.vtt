00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello friends welcome once again here 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.480
 the channel igor dvr and this is the tutorial 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.509
 the hills week the gel flick is a skin 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.150
 a three-star dribble ok and he's 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.050
 very very easy to do it to do it 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.510
 just tap the right analog 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.100
 forward and quickly a touch 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.350
 backward 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.480
 ok always remember I know what 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.150
 back to back are the directions 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 relative to where our players 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.030
 they are watched or towards where they 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.950
 they are looking ok ok the juli that is 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.350
 a very useful skill that I recommend to 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.969
 all of you who learn it and you 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.250
 can notice that the player with not doing 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.870
 click he will always turn towards the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.390
 right with about 30 degrees 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.219
 approximately this may vary by 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.230
 some factors that I really do not 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.300
 I know and look at you like the gel 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.210
 flick is useful one can haggle the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.620
 goalkeeper very easily and dial 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.399
 golazos ok 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.830
 Well now let's see how it's done 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.850
 in the joystick look I do not do it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.600
 straight 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.640
 forward back very easy very easy ok 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.979
 it has to be with one more speed or 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.380
 less similar to the one I did and the gel 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.340
 flick is very useful to do this look 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.560
 What comic david luiz kick which 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.020
 golazo what you can use the gel 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.220
 flick to fix the ball to give 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 a pain in a regional state like that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.740
 which is very good good and also the river 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.509
 flick is very useful when we want 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.050
 bargain an opponent when we are one 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.149
 against one ok be the doorman or 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.979
 also another player who is us 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.409
 checking and another flick gel utility 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.330
 is to change the rhythm of the game be 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.979
 I can stop and do it for 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.460
 boot and I for being running and 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.840
 do it to change my speed and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.789
 ok and good direction the flick gel can 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.659
 be executed at any speed of 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.270
 standing 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.130
 running fast or running slowly and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.380
 look how easy it is to haggle the goalkeeper 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.730
 just enter the left diagonal 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 as I'm doing to see what I'm going to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.230
 do again here and click 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.400
 that the goalkeeper is going to be 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 seeing dust look at you and what a goal 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 wonderful that I think to do there 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 with david luiz a really nice goal and 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.840
 you can try and do it 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.549
 I also guarantee who the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.830
 be very easy to bargain 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.670
