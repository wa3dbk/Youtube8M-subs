00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.230 
the head where it used to be all silver
for<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.130> horn<00:03:19.760> now<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.720> actually<00:03:21.080> gold

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
for the horn now is actually gold

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.610 
for the horn now is actually gold
another<00:03:23.240> interesting<00:03:23.510> change<00:03:23.990> is<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.470> they

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
another interesting change is that they

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.760 
another interesting change is that they
actually<00:03:24.830> brighten<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.610> his<00:03:26.510> eyes<00:03:26.810> compared

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
actually brighten up his eyes compared

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.320 
actually brighten up his eyes compared
to<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.250> original<00:03:29.110> blade<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:31.090> don't<00:03:32.090> know<00:03:32.150> why

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
to the original blade I don't know why

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.740 
to the original blade I don't know why
but<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.690> does<00:03:32.720> look<00:03:33.050> much<00:03:33.200> better

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
but it does look much better

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.440 
but it does look much better
as<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.200> wings<00:03:36.459> because<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.970> actually

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
as for the wings because it actually

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.880 
as for the wings because it actually
absorbed<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.310> jack<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.720> here<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.200> the
