00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 well I'll start here I'll do 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.800
 Querétaro in Mexico and this area is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 the weird weather is supposed to be 21 already 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 that is, in a few days it is already 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.550
 spring 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.859
 but the weather is crazy since yesterday 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.600
 Yesterday the whole day rained everything 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.370
 the day or it went down and rose the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 intensity but all he destroyed seeing 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.299
 and I love myself I'm happy you kg 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 so it's a bit strange in the weather 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.530
 even today it is overpopulated I hope that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 the light does not look so bad but it's super 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.790
 cloudy also then systems 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.550
 basic they bring a little as well as more now 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.400
 for this climate like a very basic crazy 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.240
 for spring is my sunscreen what 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.520
 that has given solar 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 because I do not know if it goes to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.100
 be drinking all day or if from 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.960
 the sun will suddenly rise 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.880
 I've seen a lot of alcohols this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 lesbian week it rains sedentary start 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.369
 of sun then you always have to be 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 well protected even when it is cloudy 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 because the sun rotates and then you do not have to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 protect our skin 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.460
 and this bird is the factor of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.540
 50 solar protection and is super good 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 because you can put it before 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 makeup and it does not leave you greasy or anything 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.260
 get out these guys saw them in the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.900
 makeup makeup for 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.430
 spring is my doctor and this one is 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.740
 l'oreal and has protection factor 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.350
 solar mind and it's super good because it's 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 as a light cover and also you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.830
 Protects the skin and is super good 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
 decrease the appearance of pores 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.259
 open is such a good face too 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 I have any hope and facial because 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.950
 then if it's hot 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 this can be extracted in your bag and from 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.489
 suddenly cool you or if you put powder 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.370
 with these is that it does not look like 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.080
 loaded your makeup and well here I have 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.410
 this one that is michael fix to ashes 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.470
 debian 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.850
 and it's the same as a facial spray and this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.980
 shopping in se outside come in little packages 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.760
 of two sticks of course if the sun 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.070
 who wants to leave this 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.190
 we can wear shorts we can wear skirts 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.010
 then we must have this at hand 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.640
 this is the rake I use I do not know 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.630
 if you want to know this thorns 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 and I believe you 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.890
 I like them there is also a little yellow 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.410
 like it a lot and you are a cream for 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.900
 shave this howes and they already sell it in 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.450
 woman this this I bought it when 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.980
 usa but I believe it as well as woman and I saw 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.730
 that there was already of this vanilla 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.590
 then they come back super rich 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.960
 super rich and leaves you super skin 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.360
 suavecita this is not you as well as you see that 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.400
 for example the one of killer or if it leaves you 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.130
 as happy as well as foam this is like 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.560
 a creampie and it's great you leave the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.910
 skin very soft and smells super rich and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.130
 since we are on the subject of the skin 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.710
 soft and others is super important that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.970
 We put our skin through low 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.650
 changes in climate because we do not know if it's going 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.510
 to be value if it's going to be cold and it's going to 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.000
 be wet then always be 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.750
 as keeping its humidity is now 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.130
 using is this boat that is for you 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.130
 this combat 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.810
 and it is the most very rich 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.430
 hello very rich and like if you keep 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.320
 your wetting my favorite good the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.270
 I had before is right now teachers 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.740
 of those and I'm really enjoying it but 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.800
 my favorite of all life was that of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.980
 that James said for example that if 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.080
 will you believe I can have one to one this but 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.240
 I ended up buying this to try but 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.950
 super boat name but well so that 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.040
 It is also very good if you want a 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.870
 recommendation the same my hair with the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.670
 moisture come together in a huge ball of 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.280
 frizz in fact right now as you can see 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.290
 so my little hair is drying up and 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.330
 It starts to get weird depending on the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.880
 weather then I always like it 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.700
 protect it with this that is the vip all 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.110
 extraordinary then in this or the other 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.460
 which is more intense and I know 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.100
 had taught that that as in the 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.950
 night and this one what is going to do is that 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.620
 like it's going to keep the humidity of your 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.380
 hair and if there is moisture outside you do not know 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.420
 is going to be frizz or if there is sun, do not do it 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.950
 so let's try then I 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.320
 I like it a lot and it also tells you cute hair 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.360
 super rich and super soft 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.850
 and this is going to cost you about a hundred and 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.770
 something weights in the super strange occasion 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.090
 I recommend this but now in clothes 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.710
 lately I always go out with my glasses 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.410
 of sun in the bag and now I bring these 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.410
 good depends or you can see there 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.309
 depends on the car I bring some and in the 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.990
 bag I bring some because always then 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.729
 happens that it is something and they forget me already 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.929
 I bring the ones from the car as well as I have 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.209
 my spare parts these are just like that 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:20.230
 will arrive aviator are not rivals are 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:23.290
 lexicon are and are 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.790
 green and I like a good as they look 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.340
 posts but like for this if 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.890
 You need me to warm up so that you 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.660
 wash if it does not look like weird everything like 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.850
 rainy and you with these lenses like that 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.980
 close for them for when there's rain 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.450
 but there's also sun I put blacks 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.450
 you do not know strange thing 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.920
 and right now is a basic for example I 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.870
 normally dressed and go after that is 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.910
 normal because I do not know I'm in my house and 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.590
 it's hot and then I go out and do 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.470
 very cold then super good 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.940
 get out like with this kind of sweaters that 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.250
 He is quite thin, he is thin from 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.830
 then it covers you from the cold and you're not 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.200
 as well as with the downpour over for 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.290
 rain that is great to bring a 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.720
 gabardine how are you then you already have 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.610
 your normal clothes afterwards if it's cold 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.800
 put your luck and over your raincoats 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.020
 and because it's raining that you do not get wet 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.910
 clothing 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.379
 it's already super good because once when 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.060
 it's raining once it protects you 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.639
 of water is already as much easier 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.860
 Cover yourself with the cold for shoes what to 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:29.879
 I like to use these days are for 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.090
 these droplets example because they are not a 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.250
 long boots as well as give me warmth 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.099
 they are small booties I get 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.349
 right to the ankle and in addition or the sole 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.659
 it's like pretty intense that I do not 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.550
 I'm going to slip if it rains like that if I have 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.740
 to go through puddles or whatever it is not me 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.139
 It's scary that they're ruined because they're like that 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.690
 like fake fur 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.729
 then they repel the good water not 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.130
 they repel it but it does not fit like 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.319
 cloth boots or something like that then you're 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.380
 I like to use when you 're writing and from 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.080
 crazy the different to my basics for me 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.610
 crazy spring in querétaro and good 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.409
 tell me what are your basics of 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.389
 twins in the comments if there are any 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.729
 that has not been said for all 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.650
 others know and do not forget to move on 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.349
 see the anahí videos of nat that 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.479

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.780

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.780
