 It seems absurd but the more you talk 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.980

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 true sense inscriptions I can not 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.119
 believe that you have found what 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 3 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.269
 how many times have we been here 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.300
 how many beauty I have already lost the 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.300
 account 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.329
 i 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.829
 the invasion will fail 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.829
 and we lose everything 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.339
 dies within five minutes of stepping on that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.339
 beach and today all the soldiers 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.780
 come and find me when you wake up 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.190
 you know is happening to me 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.690
 and you have done with his power like all 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.490
 the days 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.490
 come here to train you 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.890
 other 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.100
 If you have broken your leg, I 'm not going back 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.100
 to have 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.440
 I'm not a basement where I do not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 you are a weapon 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.729
 to conquer the rest of the world 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 unless you are not there we are not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.960
 prepared for what's out there 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700
 what are you hiding from me? 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.239
 it will be dark in a few hours we 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.260
 we snuggle in front of the fireplace with a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.190
 wine bottle 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.190
 we should restart
