00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
lot of changes that valve doesn't

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
lot of changes that valve doesn't
release<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.180> being<00:01:39.570> done<00:01:39.720> as

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
release that are actually being done as

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.350 
release that are actually being done as
well<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> big<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.060> if

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
well and this is a big one because if

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
well and this is a big one because if
you<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.570> behind<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.049> before<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you are behind here before I'm just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
you are behind here before I'm just
hiding<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.210> terrorists<00:01:45.570> could<00:01:45.659> actually<00:01:45.810> see

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hiding the terrorists could actually see

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.980 
hiding the terrorists could actually see
your<00:01:46.229> feet<00:01:46.409> which<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.770> big<00:01:47.280> issue

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
your feet which is a big issue

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.179 
your feet which is a big issue
competitively<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> cool<00:01:49.979> change

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
competitively so that is a cool change

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.010 
competitively so that is a cool change
so<00:01:50.509> props<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> valve<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.110> fixing<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.619> there

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
so props the valve for fixing out there

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
so props the valve for fixing out there
change<00:01:55.020> cover<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> teesside<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> upper<00:01:56.610> park

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
change cover in teesside of upper park

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539 
change cover in teesside of upper park
so<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.780> move<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.140> rectangle<00:01:58.829> flower<00:01:59.130> bed

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so then move the rectangle flower bed

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
so then move the rectangle flower bed
here<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.119> added<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.079> rock<00:02:01.439> which<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.950> cool<00:02:02.100> i

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
here and added a rock which is cool i

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.440 
here and added a rock which is cool i
think<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> makes<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.060> smoother

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
think it makes them a little smoother

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.789 
think it makes them a little smoother
here<00:02:03.770> move<00:02:04.770> t<00:02:05.009> spawns<00:02:05.340> forward<00:02:05.939> slightly<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
here move t spawns forward slightly so I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.150 
here move t spawns forward slightly so I
think<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> radar<00:02:08.819> here

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
think as you can see on the radar here

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.450 
think as you can see on the radar here
looks<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.120> goes<00:02:11.270> forward<00:02:11.710> slightly<00:02:12.710> like

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
looks like it goes forward slightly like

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.520 
looks like it goes forward slightly like
I<00:02:13.610> said<00:02:13.670> that'll<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.660> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.930> interesting<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
I said that'll be kind of interesting to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.300 
I said that'll be kind of interesting to
see<00:02:16.060> what<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.210> does<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.840> rushes<00:02:18.310> through

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
see what it does to be rushes through

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.950 
see what it does to be rushes through
what<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.640> does<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.970> know<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> any<00:02:20.420> rush<00:02:20.690> really

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
what it does you know to any rush really

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.770 
what it does you know to any rush really
even<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.860> ladder<00:02:22.070> room<00:02:22.370> what<00:02:23.150> kind<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.360> timing

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
even a ladder room what kind of timing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.230 
even a ladder room what kind of timing
it's<00:02:23.900> going<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> change<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.470> that's<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.460> cool<00:02:25.640> I

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
it's going to change so that's a cool I

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.780 
it's going to change so that's a cool I
think<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.810> good<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.400> really<00:02:28.400> can't<00:02:28.430> comment

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
think it's good I really can't comment

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.090 
think it's good I really can't comment
on<00:02:28.910> too<00:02:29.270> much<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.200> we'll<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:30.950> keep

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
on too much so we'll just kind of keep

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.070 
on too much so we'll just kind of keep
it<00:02:31.190> at<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.450> another<00:02:32.450> change<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:32.870> move

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it at that another change here move

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.520 
it at that another change here move
bombsight<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.770> plant<00:02:34.100> zone<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.580> slightly<00:02:35.530> I'm

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
bombsight a plant zone up slightly I'm

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.080 
bombsight a plant zone up slightly I'm
not<00:02:36.620> really<00:02:36.800> sure<00:02:36.890> exactly<00:02:37.280> what<00:02:37.910> they<00:02:38.030> did

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
not really sure exactly what they did

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.000 
not really sure exactly what they did
here<00:02:38.480> I've<00:02:39.230> always<00:02:39.470> thought<00:02:39.650> you've<00:02:39.800> been<00:02:39.920> on

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
here I've always thought you've been on

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.030 
here I've always thought you've been on
a<00:02:40.040> plant<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.760> line<00:02:40.970> here<00:02:41.800> with<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> L

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
a plant with the line here with the L

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.430 
a plant with the line here with the L
wall<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.330> was<00:02:44.510> kind<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.780> normal<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.080> me<00:02:45.200> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
wall so that was kind of normal to me so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.390 
wall so that was kind of normal to me so
maybe<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.770> out<00:02:45.890> further<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.580> way<00:02:47.920> or<00:02:48.920> maybe

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
maybe it's out further this way or maybe

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.930 
maybe it's out further this way or maybe
up<00:02:49.640> up<00:02:49.880> further<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.420> way<00:02:50.480> I'm<00:02:51.440> not<00:02:51.620> sure

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
up up further this way I'm not sure

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.810 
up up further this way I'm not sure
which<00:02:52.940> way<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.180> further<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.980> think<00:02:55.670> it's

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
which way it's further but I think it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.640 
which way it's further but I think it's
good<00:02:55.970> either<00:02:56.150> way<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.900> they've<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.410> know

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
good either way that they've I you know

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.930 
good either way that they've I you know
expanded<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.250> bomb<00:02:58.460> set<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> little<00:02:58.790> bit

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
expanded the bomb set a little bit

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.880 
expanded the bomb set a little bit
further<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.780> not<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.050> full<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.440> go<00:03:00.590> into<00:03:00.740> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
further so not the full we go into the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.400 
further so not the full we go into the
site<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:02.570> yeah<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:02.780> these<00:03:03.020> changes<00:03:03.380> are

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
site so yeah I think these changes are

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.410 
site so yeah I think these changes are
good<00:03:04.840> definitely<00:03:05.840> adds<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.140> new<00:03:06.290> dynamic<00:03:06.530> to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
good definitely adds a new dynamic to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.700 
good definitely adds a new dynamic to
overpass<00:03:08.420> which<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.780> definitely<00:03:09.230> good<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.500> we

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
overpass which is definitely good so we

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.140 
overpass which is definitely good so we
are<00:03:09.860> making<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.550> step<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.910> right<00:03:11.090> direction

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
are making a step in the right direction

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.480 
are making a step in the right direction
for<00:03:11.720> sure<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.890> will<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.250> see<00:03:13.370> how<00:03:13.430> it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
for sure and I will have to see how it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.320 
for sure and I will have to see how it
plays<00:03:13.610> out<00:03:13.820> guys<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.270> take<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.720> easy<00:03:14.840> right
