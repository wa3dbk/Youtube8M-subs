00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
activation trip at first i thought this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
activation trip at first i thought this
was<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> sim<00:01:24.330> card<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.720> gave<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
was like a sim card they gave me but it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.359 
was like a sim card they gave me but it
was<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.740> activation<00:01:26.310> chip<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:29.189> what

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
was an activation chip so basically what

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.100 
was an activation chip so basically what
you<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.090> put<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> activation<00:01:32.579> chip

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
you do is you put the activation chip

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.249 
you do is you put the activation chip
into<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.990> JV<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.659> real<00:01:39.659> javi<00:01:40.140> as

disconnect<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:23.310> anything<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:24.000> they

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
disconnect or anything because they

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.910 
disconnect or anything because they
