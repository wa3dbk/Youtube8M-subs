00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.830
 Y 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.280
 when you draw in perspective almost never 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.469
 they have vanishing points inside the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140
 leaf the ideal is that you learn to 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.330
 visualize those points very far from your 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 drawing so that they approach the shape 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.900
 that they have things in reality in 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.789
 this video that I'm showing a 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.619
 example of how this is done at three 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.289
 vanishing points actually no 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.659
 secret in the process the steps to 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.820
 draw are the same simply you 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.489
 canvas or your sheet on which you draw is 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.410
 Well in smaller proportions 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.750
 If you look at the drawing you have in between a 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.940
 white rectangle we can consider that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.040
 that is your white sheet and that everything gray 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680
 what is around is your desk or your 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.200
 working table what happens is that the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.180
 points are very far from the sheet if at 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.330
 principle costs you a little bit of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.790
 work to do this you can put some 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.010
 coin a pencil sharpener or something small in 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.370
 the place where where would you have those 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 points to help you visualize and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.180
 trace the lines 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.009
 in that sense towards that direction what 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.650
 ideal as I tell you is that you can 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.650
 visualize those points that you do not need 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.720
 your hand is directed towards a coin 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.940
 will use points that you can only see 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.130
 that at some point they will be counted as 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.900
 I was telling you this can be applied for 1 2 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.030
 and 3 vanishing points of the rules are the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.760
 they simply have to be visualized 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.730
 your points a little further 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.350
 this is this is more complicated because 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.420
 we battle a little to match 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.030
 the lines where they should coincide on 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.500
 all the hidden lines is important 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.020
 Do not stop drawing the lines 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.869
 hidden because later you go to what 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.220
 you are going to need if then you have to 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.460
 have a little patience in this 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.040
 part and something that you must take care of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.160
 quite is that if you turn the sheet you should 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.770
 to be well aware that your line 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.869
 horizon and your vanishing points rotate 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.910
 together with you then do not go to 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.260
 confuse you there when drawing those 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.970
 lines then well patience already 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.390
 keep drawing I see them in the next 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.390
