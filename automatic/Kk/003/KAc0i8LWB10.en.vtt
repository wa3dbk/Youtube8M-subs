00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so I really like the texture of the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
so I really like the texture of the
gummy<00:01:44.579> ball<00:01:44.970> although<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.689> taste<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.200> sort<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
gummy ball although the taste is sort of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
gummy ball although the taste is sort of
faint<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.369> definitely<00:01:47.850> prefer<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
faint so I definitely prefer it with the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.069 
faint so I definitely prefer it with the
sauce

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
sauce

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
sauce
so<00:01:49.170> let's<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.590> ahead<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.920> try<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> sauce<00:01:50.579> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so let's go ahead and try the sauce on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
so let's go ahead and try the sauce on
its<00:01:51.090> own<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> sauce<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.619> really

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
its own so the sauce is actually really

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649 
its own so the sauce is actually really
sherbety<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> taste<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
sherbety but I think the taste of the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.999 
sherbety but I think the taste of the
sauce<00:01:54.840> along<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> texture<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sauce along with the texture of the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.550 
sauce along with the texture of the
balls<00:01:56.189> goes<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.729> nice<00:01:57.030> together<00:01:57.560> overall

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
balls goes really nice together overall

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440 
balls goes really nice together overall
