00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.450
 no doubt many are already giving the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.209
 countdown to the arrival from years 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 of war ultimate edition to receive what 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.219
 that was the true first chapter of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.529
 this great saga by the way a title of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.649
 10 and a title that I will always say in 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.899
 xbox 360 continues to show off in a way 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.059
 spectacular and what years and years ago 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.890
 that this title appeared and for that very reason 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.860
 I sent you that question there are so many improvements 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 to buy this ultimate software 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.070
 good edition because precisely I leave you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.330
 answer all of you watching this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 video the last video that has been 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.490
 published in which the developers 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.560
 of this and ultimate software edition no 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.420
 they present you with new videos about the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.120
 process of creating this edition of the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.850
 game that is going to be launched not only on xbox 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.920
 one but also in pc a lot of attention 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 because in these new videos they want 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.520
 focus on two aspects of the universe of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 game on the one hand enemies the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.079
 called locus and on the other hand the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.860
 scenarios that we will find in this 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.710
 ultimate software edition 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.270
 good for the most part are exactly the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.480
 same as we saw in the xbox version 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.070
 360 but obviously improved we can 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.440
 see the work that has been done to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.110
 update designs improve their appearance and 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.470
 trace all these elements of the game 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 original to update them if you want 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.850
 see the full video that by the way 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 It lasts quite long I leave the link of the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.540
 original news in the description of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 this same video so you can see it 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.540
 for yourselves it's worth it and my 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.369
 question is there are so many improvements for 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.410
 buy, I repeat, you see them 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.119
 substantially one must also say 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.610
 Good thing we talked about it recently 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.610
 they were going to give us the whole saga for 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.520
 play it retro compatible mode your 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080
 versions of xbox 360 but play it on 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.610
 our xbox one I think it's a great 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.040
 gift I also think that the price of this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.649
 ultimate edition software is pretty 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 attractive but good the final decision 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.280
 it's always yours so guys and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.780
 You girls are the ones that you have to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.780
 decide if it's worth it or not 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.130
 production
