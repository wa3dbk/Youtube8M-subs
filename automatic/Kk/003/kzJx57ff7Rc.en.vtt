the<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the thing about these right here is you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
the thing about these right here is you
have<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.640> careful<00:01:45.299> when<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> open

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have to be very careful when you open

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
have to be very careful when you open
these<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> hard<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:48.030> off

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
these it's kind of hard to take off

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.429 
these it's kind of hard to take off
which<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> good<00:01:49.380> thing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
which I think that's a good thing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
which I think that's a good thing
because<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.490> contacts<00:01:51.030> aren't

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because you know your contacts aren't

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
because you know your contacts aren't
protected<00:01:52.490> they<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.290> on

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
protected they do have like this for on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
protected they do have like this for on
it<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.479> very<00:01:57.509> careful<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it so you want to be very careful and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.130 
it so you want to be very careful and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
them on I thought they sent the wrong

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.100 
them on I thought they sent the wrong
kind<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.100> because<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.730> flipped<00:02:17.270> one<00:02:18.020> of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
kind and that's because I flipped one of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.830 
kind and that's because I flipped one of
my<00:02:18.200> contexts<00:02:18.890> were<00:02:19.010> flipped<00:02:19.370> inside<00:02:20.240> out<00:02:20.300> or

my contexts were flipped inside out or

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.480 
my contexts were flipped inside out or
whatever<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.320> that's<00:02:21.440> probably<00:02:21.920> why<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.220> was

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
whatever and that's probably why it was

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.180 
whatever and that's probably why it was
like<00:02:22.790> everybody<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:23.450> eyes<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.470> make<00:02:24.770> sure<00:02:24.980> both
