00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
material was nailed however I feel like

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.000 
material was nailed however I feel like
where<00:01:55.600> everything<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:56.140> in<00:01:56.290> slow<00:01:56.410> motion<00:01:56.740> right

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
where everything is in slow motion right

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.650 
where everything is in slow motion right
now<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.580> that's<00:01:57.790> not<00:01:57.940> necessarily<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.600> bad

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
now and that's not necessarily a bad

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.420 
now and that's not necessarily a bad
thing<00:01:59.080> either<00:01:59.140> but<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.740> does<00:01:59.950> give<00:02:00.160> us<00:02:00.250> more

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
thing either but it does give us more

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
thing either but it does give us more
time<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.850> focus<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.750> technique<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:04.150> day

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

take that hip weight down into the hill
and<00:02:19.240> then<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.810> move<00:02:19.959> off<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.530> go<00:02:20.650> across

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and then as you move off of it go across

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.070 
and then as you move off of it go across
over<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> ball<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.820> foot<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.480> weights<00:02:22.780> not

over the ball the foot the weights not

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560 
over the ball the foot the weights not
right<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.709> ends<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.280> being<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:25.090> surface

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
right so it ends up being like a surface

right so it ends up being like a surface

instead of really grounded and
hard-hitting<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> that's<00:02:29.260> why<00:02:29.470> those<00:02:29.709> feet

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
hard-hitting and that's why those feet

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.530

for<00:02:30.340> both<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> were<00:02:30.850> kind<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.180> sliding<00:02:31.360> all

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540

over the place Melissa your feet

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.010 
over the place Melissa your feet
actually<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.090> know<00:02:34.209> from<00:02:34.390> time<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.690> time<00:02:34.750> when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
actually you know from time to time when

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.449 
actually you know from time to time when
you<00:02:35.140> weren't<00:02:35.350> turned<00:02:35.650> out<00:02:35.860> when<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.160> had<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
you weren't turned out when you had the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.120 
you weren't turned out when you had the
swivel<00:02:36.820> they're<00:02:37.180> too<00:02:37.450> far<00:02:37.720> turned<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.440> you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
swivel they're too far turned in you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.800 
swivel they're too far turned in you
know<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.610> went<00:02:39.760> from<00:02:39.940> one<00:02:40.180> extreme<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
know so it went from one extreme to the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.320 
know so it went from one extreme to the
next<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.770> lose<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.130> sexy<00:02:42.880> line<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
next and you lose that sexy line and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.180 
next and you lose that sexy line and
like<00:02:43.450> Nigel<00:02:43.660> said<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.230> were<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.590> sexy<00:02:45.010> when

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
like Nigel said you were just sexy when

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.130 
like Nigel said you were just sexy when
you<00:02:45.310> stand<00:02:45.610> still<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.840> when<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.110> put

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
you stand still so I think when you put

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.410 
you stand still so I think when you put
too<00:02:47.470> much<00:02:47.620> effort<00:02:47.890> into<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.490> almost<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.270> know

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
too much effort into it almost you know

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
too much effort into it almost you know
it<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.810> went<00:02:50.410> away<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.100> been
