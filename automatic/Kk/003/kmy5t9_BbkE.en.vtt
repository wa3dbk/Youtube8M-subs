black tops yeah it's like black or gray
I<00:00:42.870> guess<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.440> safety<00:00:43.710> feature<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.370> when

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I guess that's a safety feature for when

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.590 
I guess that's a safety feature for when
you're<00:00:44.579> running<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.030> don't<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.210> why<00:00:45.329> you'd<00:00:45.510> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you're running I don't know why you'd be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
you're running I don't know why you'd be
running<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.230> boot<00:00:46.469> wait<00:00:46.860> that's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
running in your boot wait that's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
running in your boot wait that's
probably<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.570> running<00:00:49.020> boots

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
probably what it's for running boots

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
probably what it's for running boots
running<00:00:49.739> boots<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.640> traction<00:00:50.910> on

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
running boots they have some traction on

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
running boots they have some traction on
the<00:00:51.300> bottom<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> bought<00:00:52.949> them

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the bottom there by well I bought them

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
the bottom there by well I bought them
because<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.610> refer<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.149> sneaker<00:00:54.660> boots

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
because they refer to a sneaker boots

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229
