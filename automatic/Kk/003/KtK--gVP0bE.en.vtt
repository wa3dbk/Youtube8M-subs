00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to try it so I did some swatches on my

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.249 
to try it so I did some swatches on my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
mail board and they're kind of very

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.280 
mail board and they're kind of very
faint<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:44.270> some<00:01:45.270> reason<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.689> didn't<00:01:45.990> watch<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
faint so some reason I didn't watch the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.270 
faint so some reason I didn't watch the
long<00:01:46.850> anyway<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
long anyway this one is probably the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
long anyway this one is probably the
most<00:01:50.490> unique<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.960> collection<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
most unique one in this collection and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.420 
most unique one in this collection and
it<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> movies<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:56.130> really

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it is not like in the movies is a really

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
it is not like in the movies is a really
