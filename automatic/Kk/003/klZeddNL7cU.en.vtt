00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
games now this music is so iconic that I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
games now this music is so iconic that I
thought<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.480> narrating<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> video

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
thought about not narrating the video

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
thought about not narrating the video
just<00:00:28.920> using<00:00:29.250> annotations<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:30.060> something<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
just using annotations or something but

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
just using annotations or something but
honestly<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.949> greatest

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
honestly this is not the greatest

the<00:00:41.100> motif<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.700> moving<00:00:42.059> platforms<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
the motif is moving platforms and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
the motif is moving platforms and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
how to deal with the enemies is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.779 
how to deal with the enemies is
absolutely<00:00:49.170> crucial<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.219> trick<00:00:50.399> i'm<00:00:50.520> using

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
absolutely crucial the trick i'm using

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459 
absolutely crucial the trick i'm using
here<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.030> throwing<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:51.690> sub<00:00:51.899> weapons<00:00:52.230> while

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
here is throwing my sub weapons while

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.779 
here is throwing my sub weapons while
swinging<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.280> something<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.670> i

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
swinging and that's something that i

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.180 
swinging and that's something that i
really<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> use<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.440> outside

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
really don't get a lot of use of outside

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
really don't get a lot of use of outside
of<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.550> particular<00:00:56.760> level<00:00:57.449> i<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> lot

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of this particular level i use it a lot

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
of this particular level i use it a lot
because<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.449> skeleton<00:01:00.449> might<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.930> three

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because those skeleton might take three

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
because those skeleton might take three
hits<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:03.890> they're<00:01:04.890> placed<00:01:05.220> perfectly<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
hits and they're placed perfectly to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
hits and they're placed perfectly to
knock<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> holes<00:01:06.750> everywhere

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
knock you in a holes everywhere

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
knock you in a holes everywhere
absolutely<00:01:07.740> everywhere<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.970> hit<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.540> kill

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
absolutely everywhere one hit will kill

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
absolutely everywhere one hit will kill
you<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.290> stage<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.760> stage<00:01:12.030> nine

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you in this stage and like stage nine

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
you in this stage and like stage nine
before<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:14.280> way

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
before it if you don't know your way

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
before it if you don't know your way
through<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> you're<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.750> die<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> lot

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
through it you're going to die a lot

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.149 
through it you're going to die a lot
learning<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> level<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> throws

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
learning the level and then it throws

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
learning the level and then it throws
this<00:01:20.310> trick<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.540> these

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this trick at you you have these

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640 
this trick at you you have these
swinging<00:01:22.770> platforms<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:24.140> moving<00:01:25.140> conveyor

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
swinging platforms on moving conveyor

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.480 
swinging platforms on moving conveyor
belts<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.450> nasty

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
belts which is just really really nasty

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010 
belts which is just really really nasty
so<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> course<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.659> vertical

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
so then you of course have a vertical

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
so then you of course have a vertical
section<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> level<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:33.110> top

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
section of the level with these top

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.240 
section of the level with these top
right<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> screen<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
right of the screen you can see that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340 
right of the screen you can see that
gear<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> fall<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
gear that's about to fall on me this is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
gear that's about to fall on me this is
another<00:01:37.560> trick<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
another trick you really have to know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
another trick you really have to know
where<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.079> how<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
where that's going to go and how to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
where that's going to go and how to
avoid<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:41.970> do

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
avoid it just like that if you don't do

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
avoid it just like that if you don't do
that<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.390> maneuver<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.110> year<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.500> hit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that little maneuver that year will hit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.760 
that little maneuver that year will hit
you<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.009> yes<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.090> die

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.789 

Oh<00:01:49.359> kind<00:01:50.359> of<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.719> okay<00:01:51.170> let's<00:01:51.469> rebuild

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
Oh kind of like that okay let's rebuild

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.950
