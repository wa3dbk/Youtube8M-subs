that<00:02:30.130> means<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.910> charge<00:02:31.120> more<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
that means we have to charge more for it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.250

when we make rate increases we do so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.660 
when we make rate increases we do so
because<00:02:37.240> there<00:02:37.570> really<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.990> no<00:02:38.200> other<00:02:38.350> option
