we're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.289> review<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.430> corner<00:00:27.060> cutting

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we're going to review the corner cutting

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470 
we're going to review the corner cutting
this<00:00:28.170> act<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.710> cube<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.550> cheap<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this act this cube for as cheap as it is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160 
this act this cube for as cheap as it is
is<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.080> good<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.730> my<00:00:32.730> opinion<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.059> mean<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
is very good in my opinion I mean you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
is very good in my opinion I mean you
probably<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:35.040> better<00:00:35.219> off<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
probably are better off going with a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
probably are better off going with a
Diane<00:00:36.719> Cube<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.290> you're<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> speed<00:00:37.890> cube

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
Diane Cube if you're going to speed cube

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
Diane Cube if you're going to speed cube
but<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> five<00:00:39.510> dollar<00:00:39.660> cube<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but for a five dollar cube this is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
but for a five dollar cube this is
definitely<00:00:41.780> has<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.980> better<00:00:44.010> turning

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
definitely has a way better turning

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.650 
definitely has a way better turning
quality<00:00:45.480> than<00:00:46.700> any<00:00:47.700> rubik's<00:00:48.210> cube<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
quality than any rubik's cube that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
there's no actual click mechanism like

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.319 
there's no actual click mechanism like
in<00:01:59.750> a<00:02:00.140> v-cube<00:02:00.530> six<00:02:00.950> or<00:02:01.130> anything<00:02:01.490> like<00:02:01.729> it's

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
in a v-cube six or anything like it's

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.219 
in a v-cube six or anything like it's
smooth<00:02:02.719> but<00:02:03.170> there's<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.890> track<00:02:04.479> sort<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.600> on

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
smooth but there's a track sort of on

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.160 
smooth but there's a track sort of on
all<00:02:06.380> these<00:02:06.530> pieces<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.720> that's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
all these pieces you see it there that's

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.030 
all these pieces you see it there that's
right<00:02:09.349> there<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.120> when<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.209> turn<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.870> just

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
right there and when you turn it it just

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.350 
right there and when you turn it it just
makes<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> noise<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:15.379> actually<00:02:16.360> kind

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
makes that noise so it's actually kind

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.539 
makes that noise so it's actually kind
of<00:02:17.420> loud<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:20.830> we're<00:02:21.830> doing<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
of loud if you just we're doing that you

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.940 
of loud if you just we're doing that you
can't<00:02:22.580> really<00:02:22.879> be<00:02:23.330> quiet<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.250> salted<00:02:25.250> and
