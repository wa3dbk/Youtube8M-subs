00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.529
 good everyone I'm 3 again here in gt 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.330
 after a very long time very much 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.210
 time without seeing each other faces very much 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.009
 time without seeing any video algete and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.960
 you will only be asking what the fuck 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.029
 has happened why the hell you have not 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.039
 I raised nothing in 10 months but in this 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.010
 explanatory video to explain you because 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.780
 all this has happened and to tell you what 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.519
 is what has happened in the first place 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.580
 ask forgiveness for all in the activity 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.920
 but there are some pretty reasons 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.840
 reasonable for her the first reason 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960
 I suppose you have all supposed it with 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.879
 the city ​​cost is a fucking junk game 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.220
 that is, it does not make sense to make guides of a 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.970
 game in which by pressing the button 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.100
 shoot you kill people already like this simple 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.900
 multi sense the game if it's a whore 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.339
 seriously slobber that is the worst 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.890
 critical that we have played I think that 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.540
 we are in 90% of those that we play with 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.840
 the iut and we will agree with them 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.100
 and believe me I tried to make guides 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.150
 of this game 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.790
 believe me seriously was here to guide 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.409
 of arms of the sc 2010 but seriously not 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.210
 I have a point of what I said in this 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.790
 game no more game play mode 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 aliens because it's entertaining and such but 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.229
 there until there I'll get the second 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.210
 why I had to take this 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.320
 decision was that he was in the second 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.600
 year of my senior cycle of 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 audiovisuals and I really did not have 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.500
 time for nothing because in the morning 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.479
 I had class and in the afternoon I had practice or 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.369
 is to get home and have to play a 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.750
 I play as politicians to get me clips 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 things like no no 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 do not 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 then let's say that these two reasons 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.780
 which are quite important together with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.830
 the reason that we did not have 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 collaborator is how we had blank 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.890
 then two or in moving three as per 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.080
 example in his brother or prisoner they were 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.970
 very serious collaborators and that each 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.340
 week they brought us content and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.340
 We practically have 12 videos a day 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.250
 thanks to them because white 2 went down a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 little that level of collaborators and it came 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.400
 a point what we did not have any 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 then we could not upload content to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.269
 channel 1 but good let's leave us 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.160
 sentimentality and games and we're going to 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.310
 start with what's important what's going to happen 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 with people who return to you that you can 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.260
 have it completely safe in fact the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.319
 teacher video will call 76 goes ccoo ugt ha 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.050
 come back and basically what I want to do 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.910
 with channels unfold it in they will look for two 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.490
 channels at the same time on the one hand I'm going to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 have him 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.400
 in my section by section there are people who 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.490
 it's going to be kind of I do not know how 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.020
 call it as if it was my touch channel in 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.180
 the one that I'm going to upload my own content 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.310
 in which I consider appropriate is worth 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.310
 take into account the subscribers and it's going to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.810
 be practical basically according to live 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.270
 streaming some gameplay of something but not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.820
 I'm going to upload which companies already for sale 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 want to upload a job to the sale that 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.060
 it got a little money and want more 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.720
 youtube money is not going to be content that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.600
 rise for some reason 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.490
 I also wanted to go up a 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.370
 cooperative temper is worth some game 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.580
 in that nit writing and for example or I 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.830
 I know how to return the two cooperatives 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.290
 like that there is something more than 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.960
 chicha because I believe that a world 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.270
 cruise of a game like that is a bit 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.310
 collazo even sometimes those who do 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.660
 The wolves looks commented is so much 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.990
 while talking and they do not let you show the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.130
 history says this other thing that happens to you 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.830
 so I think that what he says 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.840
 buy operative tics are a good 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.820
 alternative then besides this I 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.920
 I really want to make videos reviews 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.270
 of games this is basically a 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.580
 analysis of the games that will come out 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.170
 initially only for play 4 because the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.180
 crisis one I have it only for the quantum 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.440
 break for when it comes out but in 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.390
 beginning do everything for play games 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.310
 4 and really will do an analysis of those 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.170
 games because I think it's a content 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.970
 interesting rack for the channel and for 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.270
 anyone who is indecisive if 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.740
 buy or not 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.470
 I will say then the typical pros cons because 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.320
 graphics stories a typical analysis 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.630
 what can you do in pro tv nigel 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.880
 basically and then we have the part of 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.390
 gt the classic part that we all know 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.770
 which is what we all hope will come out 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.450
 in the channel that are the weapons guides 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.460
 etcetera etcetera content especially 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.170
 of beauty color but coming therapy 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.570
 make other games and I can better 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.130
 in principle we do not have collaborators in 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.930
 this one at this moment we have one 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.040
 confirmed only but I will try 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.420
 get the maximum number of 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.910
 collaborators possible because I think that 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.260
 having variety is worth not only in terms of 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.730
 games but also to people who 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.350
 they comment ok so that the 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.380
 while waiting for me or listening to 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.710
 to irrigate gomez this kind of thing does not 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.230
 and I say there is a very important thing 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.689
 that I'm not going to do anymore I've already learned 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.449
 of the error 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.159
 and I'm really really fucked up by this 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.229
 kind of things that is basically that to 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.360
 sometimes advertised something on twitter or on 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.519
 youtube and for any reason 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.549
 delayed or could not do it and of course 

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:20.629
 that once again after it tires and 

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.279
 you lose a little fidelity with the 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.079
 subscribers as of now no 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.279
 I'm going to promise nothing is worth the best 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.629
 He commented well, I'm going to do this 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.349
 video but I will not say neither dates nor 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.569
 nothing basically because of that because life 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.349
 is full of problems and delays and 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.949
 the rest 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.110
 Basulto mine delayed me but this guy 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.689
 of things this inconveniences then fuck 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.219
 quite and can cause that then the 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.469
 people because I cable with you because 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.659
 you had said that this was going to go up 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.699
 day you have to undo this would be or such 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.969
 thing is from now on the 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.710
 I'm not going to say never again 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.950
 things 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.190
 in advance so good in summary 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.110
 who gives you back finally we are all 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.820
 obviously waiting until November that 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.040
 is to know the product and you do warfare 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.450
 can not upload too much content 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.150
 basically because there is no game 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.830
 Call me too much or have 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.450
 too much experience in dancing me 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.370
 would like to make guides of more than four 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.470
 but I do not have an experience with the 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.450
 battle filmin nor the time really 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.220
 because there are many games to play and 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.870
 really what I like now is to play 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.510
 to games like story mode in plan 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.700
 pass it to me if such then I will not have 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.580
 too much time also destine me 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.260
 I like it a lot but I see it very incomplete 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.330
 the truth that I was very happy with 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.100
 him but there comes a moment in what he 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.800
 repeats both the fissions not 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.570
 they change and it's a pain in the ass but I'll have 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.120
 go up a little bit of anything goes there 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.340
 more variety in the channel tells that it is 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.150
 the same at least that black ops 2 in 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.820
 regarding the amount of content 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.950
 and the guides that you all want the guides 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.810
 of weapons map guides that could 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.260
 do the advisors guides that could 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.690
 do in front of webber it will come back 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.880
 it's going to return everything that you had gone and 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.670
 I will try to put it at the height of what 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.010
 that I was and from here I seriously 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.140
 I ask very seriously that from 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.580
 November, you will be here in the channel 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.770
 download the likes because you have to 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.140
 return to the level we had before 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.700
 it was a level that really excited you 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.340
 and you and motivated you to do more 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.280
 contained but good in the summary that 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:29.640
 it turns you back to the load and we 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.640
 we see here in this channel come chao
