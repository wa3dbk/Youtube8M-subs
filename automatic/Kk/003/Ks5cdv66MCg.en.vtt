00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.710
 A typical path word 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.340
 By Rumata the straddle for the force 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.470
 Issue a pass 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.930
 We are bone movement 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.869
 Or the range of motion of the joint 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 What 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.790
 Once energy is stored 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.540
 I will pass from there to Toshio at a stretch 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.390
 At the time of preliminary operation with which I finally fly 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.470
 There is a loss of time if you can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.270
 If you stop right in front of it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.590
 You can earliest pasta if it is a path not pull the arm 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 However 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.900
 I will not fly at last because I do not eat energy 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.500
 Was large first time the new technique I was wondering if you want to skip outside flew What Toka 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.500
 Please come for a moment 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 It is a chest pass so far 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.980
 Once energy is stored 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.940
 Put out at once 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.970
 Accumulate energy once and put out at once 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.320
 I think the other hand like to pass within which the arm from Toko 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.520
 Then, until now it is a chest pass 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.850
 I will not fly before at all, so we will check my arms 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 If possible , use the horse as a fall and a horse 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 If you want to fly the path 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.170
 Arm Characteristically will professional scan 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.650
 In the same way as the path up to now to be Kitaichi a snap 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.650
 You can also rotate the ball 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.720
 Path This path is you want to put out a path without reservoir once energy once catch the ball 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.130
 is 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 So, if you catch it, do n't pull on the arm and pros the arm and put out the path 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.400
 I will 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.940
 Rapidly floss 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.220
 You eat smap 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.470
 It is hard for the opponent to detect motion 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.470
 It will be easy to pass the path to the head 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.150
 Another advantage of this pass is
