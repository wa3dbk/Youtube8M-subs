00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
soda dolphin pattern into it I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.420 
soda dolphin pattern into it I
personally<00:03:48.659> think<00:03:49.169> that<00:03:49.260> ruins<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.949> overall

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
personally think that ruins the overall

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.339 
personally think that ruins the overall
Egyptian<00:03:50.940> theme<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> turns<00:03:52.139> out

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
Egyptian theme of it but it turns out

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.319 
Egyptian theme of it but it turns out
that<00:03:52.409> dolphins<00:03:52.799> are<00:03:53.129> sapphire<00:03:53.579> Shores<00:03:53.849> lucky

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
that dolphins are sapphire Shores lucky

animal as they visit her in her dreams
oh<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.239> that's<00:03:57.659> why<00:03:58.019> we<00:03:58.199> saw<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.439> dolphins

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040

earlier<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.699> was<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> hint<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.510> Luna<00:04:00.930> had<00:04:01.049> been

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
earlier it was a hint that Luna had been

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.740 
earlier it was a hint that Luna had been
visiting<00:04:01.620> sapphire<00:04:02.099> Shores<00:04:02.459> dreams<00:04:02.909> and<00:04:03.359> it

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
visiting sapphire Shores dreams and it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
visiting sapphire Shores dreams and it
doesn't<00:04:03.959> matter<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.769> clashes<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
doesn't matter that it clashes with the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.039 
doesn't matter that it clashes with the
rest<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.849> headdress<00:04:06.269> design<00:04:06.629> because

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
rest of the headdress design because

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.349 
rest of the headdress design because
it's<00:04:07.199> deeply<00:04:07.709> meaningful<00:04:07.919> to<00:04:08.459> her<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:09.180> know

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359
