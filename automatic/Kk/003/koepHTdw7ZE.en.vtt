talk about the new bulldozer core part

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.190 
talk about the new bulldozer core part
of<00:00:29.460> our<00:00:29.579> new<00:00:29.759> next<00:00:30.270> generation<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> AMD

of our new next generation of AMD
opteron<00:00:31.560> processors<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> super<00:00:34.800> micro

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
opteron processors this is a super micro

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
opteron processors this is a super micro
system<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.970> single<00:00:36.690> socket<00:00:37.610> opteron<00:00:38.750> 6200

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
system with a single socket opteron 6200

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.980 
system with a single socket opteron 6200
series<00:00:40.250> processor<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.400> it<00:00:41.490> so<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.450> 16

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
series processor in it so this has 16

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.740 
series processor in it so this has 16
cores<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.880> as<00:00:44.880> you<00:00:45.060> can<00:00:45.240> see<00:00:45.270> you've<00:00:45.600> got

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
cores and as you can see you've got

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
cores and as you can see you've got
eight<00:00:45.960> memory<00:00:46.320> dimms<00:00:46.560> as<00:00:46.740> well<00:00:47.180> first<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
eight memory dimms as well first and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.390 
eight memory dimms as well first and
foremost<00:00:48.630> is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.590> bulldozer<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.220> going<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
foremost is that bulldozer is going to

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.890 
foremost is that bulldozer is going to
bring<00:00:50.550> new<00:00:50.730> levels<00:00:51.060> of<00:00:51.180> performance<00:00:51.360> for

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
bring new levels of performance for

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.660 
bring new levels of performance for
customers<00:00:52.380> second<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
customers second is it's going to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.950 
customers second is it's going to
increase<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.180> amount<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.450> scalability

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
increase the amount of scalability

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420 
increase the amount of scalability
because<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.070> cores

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because you're going to have more cores

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
because you're going to have more cores
and<00:00:56.670> more<00:00:56.850> memory<00:00:57.150> addressability<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:58.110> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and more memory addressability and then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.700 
and more memory addressability and then
the<00:00:58.890> third<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.130> is<00:00:59.400> the<00:01:00.500> compatibility<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the third thing is the compatibility and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.470 
the third thing is the compatibility and
the<00:01:01.770> efficiency<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.550> you'll<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.910> which

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the efficiency that you'll see which

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
the efficiency that you'll see which
will<00:01:03.720> help<00:01:03.840> drive<00:01:04.170> better<00:01:04.439> power<00:01:04.710> efficiency

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
will help drive better power efficiency

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.429 
will help drive better power efficiency
but<00:01:05.729> our<00:01:05.850> processing<00:01:06.390> efficiency<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.259> most

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
but our processing efficiency and most

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.429 
but our processing efficiency and most
importantly<00:01:07.890> better<00:01:08.100> budget<00:01:08.460> efficiency<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
importantly better budget efficiency I

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.600 
importantly better budget efficiency I
would<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> say<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.829> most<00:01:10.950> exciting<00:01:11.400> part

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
would have to say the most exciting part

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.010 
would have to say the most exciting part
is<00:01:11.759> getting<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.150> launch<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.600> been<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> long

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is getting to launch it's been a long

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
is getting to launch it's been a long
journey<00:01:13.050> it's<00:01:13.890> been<00:01:14.040> over<00:01:14.550> six<00:01:14.580> years<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
journey it's been over six years that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.970 
journey it's been over six years that
we've<00:01:15.390> been<00:01:15.510> working<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.020> car<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:16.860> it's

we've been working on this car so it's

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.500 
we've been working on this car so it's
exciting<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> bring<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.850> new<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.240> scratch

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
exciting to bring a new from scratch

and then for for us as editors it's a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.230 
and then for for us as editors it's a
good<00:01:50.650> opportunity<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.250> go<00:01:51.460> really<00:01:51.700> in-depth
