00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
so to speak is so simply a an

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.200 
so to speak is so simply a an
impressionistic<00:04:59.979> way<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.430> talking<00:05:00.789> about<00:05:00.880> the

that<00:05:05.349> will<00:05:05.470> take<00:05:05.620> place<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:06.070> personally<00:05:06.820> think

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
that will take place I personally think

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.730 
that will take place I personally think
that<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.330> Bible<00:05:07.570> is<00:05:07.630> not<00:05:07.690> clear<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.470> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
that the Bible is not clear on the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.939 
that the Bible is not clear on the
subject<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:09.430> whether<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:11.110> suffering<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.740> Hell

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
subject of whether the suffering in Hell

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:22.180 
subject of whether the suffering in Hell
is<00:05:12.130> everlasting<00:05:12.400> or<00:05:12.820> not

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190
