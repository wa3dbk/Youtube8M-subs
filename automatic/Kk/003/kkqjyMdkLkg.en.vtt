00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
I think this is like a I think probably

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.350 
I think this is like a I think probably
twenty<00:02:32.740> guys<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.340> something<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.209> on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
twenty guys or something like that or on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
each team more than a ground war

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.410 
each team more than a ground war

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
basically and then that guy kills me

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.630 
basically and then that guy kills me
behind<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> wall<00:02:41.110> dedicated<00:02:41.410> server<00:02:42.100> or<00:02:42.400> not
