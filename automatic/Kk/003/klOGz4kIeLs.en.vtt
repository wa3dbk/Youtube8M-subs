00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
sides and type like that I don't know if

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.960

the<00:03:29.480> camera<00:03:29.900> audio<00:03:30.769> can<00:03:31.010> pick<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.430> up<00:03:31.489> but

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
the camera audio can pick that up but

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.900 
the camera audio can pick that up but
let's<00:03:32.330> go<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> little<00:03:32.690> bit<00:03:32.900> closer<00:03:33.730> they've<00:03:34.730> got

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
let's go a little bit closer they've got

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.550 
let's go a little bit closer they've got
a<00:03:34.940> solid<00:03:35.180> click<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.200> when<00:03:36.410> you're

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
a solid click to it so that when you're

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
a solid click to it so that when you're
holding<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.250> doesn't<00:03:37.489> feel<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:38.000> you're

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
holding it it doesn't feel like you're

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.290 
holding it it doesn't feel like you're
going<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.330> accidentally<00:03:38.989> click<00:03:39.320> any<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.800> the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
going to accidentally click any of the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.890 
going to accidentally click any of the
buttons<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.560> front<00:03:42.830> side<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.360> guess<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
buttons on the front side so I guess the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.780 
buttons on the front side so I guess the
final<00:03:45.080> thing<00:03:45.260> we'll<00:03:45.500> take<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> look<00:03:45.950> at<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
final thing we'll take a look at is the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.150 
final thing we'll take a look at is the
box<00:03:47.030> itself<00:03:47.950> there<00:03:48.950> we<00:03:49.040> go

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
box itself there we go

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.320 
box itself there we go

when<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.340> turn<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.850> on<00:05:15.940> or<00:05:16.210> not<00:05:16.360> I'm<00:05:16.510> not<00:05:16.540> sure

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
when you turn it on or not I'm not sure

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.400 
when you turn it on or not I'm not sure
once<00:05:18.490> again<00:05:18.610> up<00:05:18.970> close<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.570> bottom<00:05:19.990> it's

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
once again up close on the bottom it's

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.890 
once again up close on the bottom it's
green<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.070> it's<00:05:21.760> rubber<00:05:22.090> so<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.480> feels<00:05:22.720> like

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
green and it's rubber so it feels like

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.480 
green and it's rubber so it feels like
it<00:05:23.020> won't<00:05:23.200> I've<00:05:23.380> got<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.680> on<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.890> table<00:05:24.130> here

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
it won't I've got it on the table here

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.640 
it won't I've got it on the table here
it's<00:05:24.640> up<00:05:24.910> it's<00:05:25.870> actually<00:05:26.230> very<00:05:28.650> slip

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
it's up it's actually very slip

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.890 
it's up it's actually very slip
resistant<00:05:30.250> which<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.550> cool<00:05:30.820> which<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.360> awesome

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
resistant which is cool which is awesome

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.770 
resistant which is cool which is awesome
actually<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:33.400> top<00:05:33.640> you<00:05:34.180> have<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.420> power

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
actually on the top you have the power

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.830 
actually on the top you have the power
button<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:36.990> see<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.440> ports<00:05:38.770> on<00:05:38.920> the<00:05:39.040> back<00:05:39.840> so

button and see the ports on the back so

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.520 
button and see the ports on the back so
you're<00:05:41.110> looking<00:05:41.230> at<00:05:41.560> your<00:05:42.570> land<00:05:45.060> HDMI<00:05:46.060> out

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
you're looking at your land HDMI out

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.180 
you're looking at your land HDMI out
optical<00:05:47.530> out<00:05:48.360> left<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.540> right<00:05:49.690> audio<00:05:49.960> out<00:05:50.410> the

optical out left and right audio out the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.700 
optical out left and right audio out the
plug<00:05:51.850> for<00:05:52.060> the<00:05:52.180> AC<00:05:52.390> and<00:05:54.090> two<00:05:55.090> USB<00:05:55.600> ports<00:05:55.710> that's

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
plug for the AC and two USB ports that's

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.200 
plug for the AC and two USB ports that's
basically<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.430> it's<00:05:57.610> pretty<00:05:57.910> straightforward

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
basically it it's pretty straightforward

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.490 
basically it it's pretty straightforward
it's<00:05:58.930> expecting<00:05:59.770> you<00:06:00.010> obviously<00:06:00.820> too<00:06:01.090> high

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
it's expecting you obviously too high

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.180 
it's expecting you obviously too high
have<00:06:01.620> an<00:06:02.330> HDMI<00:06:03.330> device<00:06:03.930> which<00:06:04.290> would<00:06:04.890> make

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
have an HDMI device which would make

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.360 
have an HDMI device which would make
sense<00:06:05.610> unlike<00:06:06.390> some<00:06:07.290> of<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.500> cheaper<00:06:07.920> options

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
sense unlike some of the cheaper options

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.530 
sense unlike some of the cheaper options
like<00:06:08.670> the<00:06:09.060> Asus<00:06:09.900> Oh<00:06:10.050> play<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:11.370> WD<00:06:11.790> TV<00:06:12.090> live

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
composit out in the such this is like

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.310 
composit out in the such this is like
yeah<00:06:19.980> you<00:06:20.310> have<00:06:20.430> HDMI<00:06:20.640> and<00:06:21.270> that's<00:06:21.930> your<00:06:22.170> only

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
yeah you have HDMI and that's your only

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.680 
yeah you have HDMI and that's your only
video<00:06:22.710> out<00:06:22.920> so<00:06:23.220> it<00:06:23.910> won't<00:06:24.090> be<00:06:24.210> plugging<00:06:24.450> this

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
video out so it won't be plugging this

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.070 
video out so it won't be plugging this

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
into a CRT screen and that's basically

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.920 
into a CRT screen and that's basically
it<00:06:28.350> for<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.680> hardware<00:06:29.630> it's<00:06:30.630> really<00:06:31.200> nice<00:06:31.500> it

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
it for the hardware it's really nice it

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.159 
it for the hardware it's really nice it
for<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:34.230> price<00:06:34.620> it<00:06:35.010> feels<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:36.120> little<00:06:36.840> bit

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
for the price it feels a little bit

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.540 
for the price it feels a little bit
better<00:06:37.440> than<00:06:38.090> it<00:06:39.090> definitely<00:06:39.570> feels<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:40.550> bit

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
better than it definitely feels a bit
