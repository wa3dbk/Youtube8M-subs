00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.510 
so I am using a crochet needle this is a
technique<00:00:19.060> caught<00:00:19.300> latching<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:21.160> put

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
the crochet needle at the root of the

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.240 
the crochet needle at the root of the
hair<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:25.210> closer<00:00:25.419> to<00:00:25.720> me<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.860> pull

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
hair get closer to me and so you pull

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.400

you<00:00:27.640> pull<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:28.090> hair<00:00:28.360> out<00:00:28.539> through<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.169> and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
you pull the hair out through it and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.069 
you pull the hair out through it and
then<00:00:29.890> on<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.160> next<00:00:30.400> cycle<00:00:31.239> you<00:00:31.689> put<00:00:31.899> it

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
then on the next cycle you put it

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.170 
then on the next cycle you put it
sideways<00:00:32.439> so<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.280> first<00:00:33.460> one<00:00:33.610> I<00:00:33.640> did<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.940> up
