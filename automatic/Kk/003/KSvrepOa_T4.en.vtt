the wot TV law
to<00:06:38.389> factory<00:06:39.289> defaults<00:06:39.770> because<00:06:40.009> you<00:06:40.099> may<00:06:40.220> have

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
to factory defaults because you may have

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.119 
to factory defaults because you may have
done<00:06:40.550> something<00:06:40.789> with<00:06:40.939> it<00:06:41.229> and<00:06:42.229> inadvertently

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
done something with it and inadvertently

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.820 
done something with it and inadvertently
put<00:06:43.370> in<00:06:43.460> a<00:06:43.580> different<00:06:44.229> setting<00:06:45.229> so<00:06:45.500> you<00:06:45.560> can

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
put in a different setting so you can

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.529 
put in a different setting so you can
flip<00:06:46.370> to<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.639> bottom<00:06:46.939> of<00:06:47.030> it<00:06:47.180> and<00:06:47.210> you'll<00:06:47.389> see

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
flip to the bottom of it and you'll see

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:48.850 
flip to the bottom of it and you'll see
like<00:06:47.689> it'll<00:06:47.900> pit<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:48.080> little<00:06:48.169> pinhole<00:06:48.710> and<00:06:48.770> you

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
like it'll pit a little pinhole and you

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.219 
like it'll pit a little pinhole and you
can<00:06:48.979> put<00:06:49.099> a<00:06:49.129> paperclip<00:06:49.520> or<00:06:49.969> a<00:06:50.030> pin<00:06:50.300> or<00:06:50.599> bobby

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
can put a paperclip or a pin or bobby

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.659 
can put a paperclip or a pin or bobby
pin<00:06:51.500> or<00:06:51.530> whatever<00:06:51.860> then<00:06:51.979> to<00:06:52.069> reset<00:06:52.370> it<00:06:52.520> so

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
pin or whatever then to reset it so

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.369 
pin or whatever then to reset it so
those<00:06:52.969> are<00:06:53.120> my<00:06:53.210> recommendations<00:06:53.330> hope<00:06:54.199> this

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
those are my recommendations hope this

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.580 
those are my recommendations hope this
works<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:54.919> good<00:06:55.400> luck
