that file
that<00:02:58.790> might<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.150> why<00:02:59.299> we're<00:02:59.510> seeing<00:02:59.689> such<00:03:00.019> a

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
that might be why we're seeing such a

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.339 
that might be why we're seeing such a
decline<00:03:01.510> honestly<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.599> probably<00:03:02.629> ride<00:03:03.170> it
