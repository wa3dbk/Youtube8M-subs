00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 or the red girl if gm 2 huaquillas and os 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 I bring the first budget of the second 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.730
 quarter of good then of the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.139
 budgets this is the lowest that is 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 the one of 349 if I'm not wrong and good 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's start with a rock fm 288 x 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.140
 but plus is a tx motherboard, so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.939
 but enough space in the future 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 we can buy it as you can see a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 crochet if we want a graphic card 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 what we want to catch more power 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.180
 and little more remember how good this would be 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.030
 the lowest and best budget we 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 will carry things of great potential 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.610
 mmd processor at 17,700 ka 3,5 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 gigahertz as you can have deduced 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.850
 many of you who follow me we are going to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.860
 want to be in this budget of 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.899
 graphics card since the processor the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 have included that is to say that they are seeing 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.300
 the processor some videos and if you can 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 play titan fan of the middle bass or there 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 and you can play without any kind of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.770
 problem 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.990
 remember that it is the lowest of the range 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.850
 of hard disk by terabytes 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.120
 enough I believe in this case a sex 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.010
 with beard heals and good a little more than 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.600
 add to this hard drive I put it many 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 Sometimes those budgets gives very good 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.010
 result so I do not have more than 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.230
 apply to this hard drive 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.960
 from bouquets from girón to kingston 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:27.020
 hyperx ddr3 to 1600 with a latency cl 9 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.970
 of 4 gb is worth in the future for good if 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310
 you acquire your computer as the expand 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.130
 RAM will like us badly 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.470
 coupling a graphics card and do 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.050
 one thing and deferred 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.580
 of one reader for the cheapest one here is 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.410
 I always say the same thing because the most 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.180
 cheap that you find 6a I'm worth because 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.290
 we are going to give it very little use since 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.260
 all the games lately are 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.270
 digital in download mode but good 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.640
 Well, one day, we want to take 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.930
 our music we want to install some 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.320
 game that we have already bought in store 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.659
 physics and etc 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.810
 of cash well the same thing more than 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.270
 same a cheap basic box that from a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.060
 decent performance and with that we are worth 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.619
 that would be because it is so worth the only 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.330
 failure that I see good because it would be the subject 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
 of the power supply since here 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.280
 would eject the source the heat down 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.980
 but good to lack, as I say 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.380
 of graphics card and little more then good 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.450
 here I will go to a fan connected like this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.580
 what's left of air down that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.280
 come out is worth so good more 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.440
 that enough I believe for what is enough 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000
 computer does not need great big 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.250
 refrigeration 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.140
 to cool still our beloved 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.380
 processor that does not heat up more than the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.560
 hell remember to be given a dry 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.410
 syntek is the köhler cpu is a 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.000
 very cheap fan very affordable but 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.110
 It will be better than the one that comes from 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.180
 be that we settle 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.360
 of power supply a nora sura no 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.520
 is 500 watts is a source more than 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.380
 basic for lacking card 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.640
 graphic that lowers us a lot 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.650
 requirements when choosing a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.110
 power supply if you have chosen 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.440
 it is for its quality price 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.610
 indicates a pretty decent result and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.850
 calm that your whole was would be 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.520
 for everything we have 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.320
 and good as you see , it's over 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.570
 this is the entire budget 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.160
 and this is the final price so good 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.320
 guys, I hope you liked to give 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.310
 like favorites and see you soon 888 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.310
