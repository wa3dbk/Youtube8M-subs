00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.260 

I<00:01:40.600> would<00:01:41.260> guess<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.620> use<00:01:41.770> about<00:01:41.980> a<00:01:42.090> quarter<00:01:43.090> or<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
I would guess I use about a quarter or a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.200 
I would guess I use about a quarter or a
third<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.720> can<00:01:43.960> every<00:01:44.260> time<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.880> clean<00:01:45.880> one<00:01:46.120> of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
third of a can every time I clean one of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.180 
third of a can every time I clean one of
these<00:01:46.300> guys<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:47.410> doesn't<00:01:47.860> take<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:48.010> whole

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
these guys that doesn't take a whole

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.580 
these guys that doesn't take a whole
bunch<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:51.220> I'll<00:01:51.370> actually<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.910> use

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
bunch and then I'll actually just use

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.650 
bunch and then I'll actually just use
hot<00:01:53.590> water<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.100> soap<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.910> clean<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.330> dry

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
before we put it back on the bike make

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.130 
before we put it back on the bike make
sure<00:03:05.110> we're<00:03:05.320> good<00:03:08.490> lighting<00:03:09.490> this<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.990> use<00:03:11.110> a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
sure we're good lighting this can use a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.650 
sure we're good lighting this can use a
little<00:03:11.380> dab<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.650> grease<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.060> channel<00:03:13.420> here

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
little dab of grease in the channel here

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020 
little dab of grease in the channel here
to<00:03:14.620> hold<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:14.920> o-ring<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.430> place<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.940> we'll

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
to hold that o-ring in place and we'll

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.550 
to hold that o-ring in place and we'll
probably<00:03:16.240> go<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.840> before<00:03:17.050> we<00:03:17.230> put<00:03:17.440> this

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
probably go do that before we put this

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.960 
probably go do that before we put this
back<00:03:17.740> on<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:17.980> bike<00:03:18.220> because<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.610> fighting

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
back on the bike because it's fighting

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.320 
back on the bike because it's fighting
staying<00:03:19.240> in<00:03:19.410> its<00:03:20.410> place<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.710> little<00:03:20.950> bit

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.420 

let's<00:03:23.870> go<00:03:24.050> do<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.680> take<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.920> little<00:03:25.160> dab<00:03:25.310> of

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
let's go do that take a little dab of

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.949 
let's go do that take a little dab of
grease

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.690

that<00:03:35.220> way<00:03:35.400> when<00:03:35.610> we<00:03:35.640> put<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.230> o-ring<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.349> there

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
that way when we put the o-ring in there

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.630 
that way when we put the o-ring in there
to<00:03:37.620> hold<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.069> place
