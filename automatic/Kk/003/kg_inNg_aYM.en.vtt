 of which just do not ski out 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.430
 plastic plywood and even eat clean 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.430
 wood 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.330
 and at this plant in the Vladimir region 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.670
 glues skis from different layers this 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.330
 modern technology calls 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.660
 sandwich kinda sandwich this 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.640
 consists of a sliding plastic surface 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.369
 Everything goes further to the laminate 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.650
 unidirectional on the core 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.199
 wood you are exactly our enterprise 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.220
 let out of aspen 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.800
 when does not emit any tarry creates 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.410
 required stiffness so we form glass 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.410
 laminate and wrap everything plastic 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 Well, then the furnace under the press we're in 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.800
 literally bakes like cookies 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 waffle irons 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.390
 in 20 minutes you can get 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 let's part-time pie is no longer easy 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.910
 contributed i will be so surprised form 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.710
 This is the most interesting look 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.260
 cooked skis became one and 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.260
 durable all focus in particular plastics 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 here you do not only do it with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.079
 using this experimental one 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.299
 installation need it to understand 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:27.420
 how durable a ski how much weight can 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:30.429
 choose obedience 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.270
 This we successfully passed tests she 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.450
 can withstand 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.700
 one and a half tons and generally their strength 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 only in this factory they are proud and prepare 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.709
 for any checks was delivered 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.099
 task at ski ministry of defense 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:48.219
 make it as strong as possible and not to 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:51.129
 broke his nose, we came up with this mess case 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.369
 years and put it on the landfill tested 

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:56.259
 crushed the tank and after all not a word 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.819
 what it was made to us so and not 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.819
 said military secret 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.280
 strength well but what about lightness 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.880
 slip so already flew off 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 her blind belly cuts 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:23.110
 and make notches so the snow does not stick 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:25.210
 and the last skis varnished in this 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.410
 tanning thanks to ultraviolet they 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.410
 dry out in seconds 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.720
 well that's all to enjoy 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.489
 walks in the fresh air 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.599
