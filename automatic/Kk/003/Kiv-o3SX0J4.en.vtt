00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.980
 yeah baby basket berlin since whole team 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.080
 comes super word two minutes today times 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 from a different perspective and me 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.010
 hope the quality is good enough with it 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.270
 you looked at this video because 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.790
 I also now a different camera 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.430
 actually only a handy camera but 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.239
 maybe it's enough you wanted 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.270
 this time, which five champions know 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.480
 I would pack in a single team 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.480
 So for me such a real op team 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.699
 and I have to on the phone the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.079
 but I 've got that 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.339
 so I think that I am a team member 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.550
 I just want to put it together 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.909
 that would be ok at the moment 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.289
 champions who must be banished 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.809
 There are champions in it 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.569
 the ones that are really strong on the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.780
 snowboards can play in the late game and the 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:11.659
 stopwatch starts in q3 is so off you go 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.290
 So my perfect team would exist 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.480
 first off jobs' top jobs pattern time 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.430
 always be banished there has to be easy 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.160
 Mass CC when he is in a whole team 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.200
 jumps and scaled it in the lake game 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.120
 it is said violently that one needs 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.790
 little time until a slate comes 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.520
 but this thing is so I'm swimming 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.880
 Jobs is always one hundred percent 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.500
 just a little too hard then if 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.450
 I find it very cool and if it is 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.580
 currently still can really roll snow 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.490
 that is longer because I would be in the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.380
 Jungle pack has the advantage 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.790
 that he makes his love in the jungle 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.010
 yes you have the bushes so he always 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.140
 can jump out 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.660
 otherwise no one can do that already 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.640
 yunus crossblade so far yunus has and 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.660
 perhaps even a single world in 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.280
 the skin leaves the smoothies like nothing else 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.020
 renger and jacques we will be 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.000
 times really two thick beasts as adc 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.250
 i would say caitlin caitlin is 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 always in itself they drive safely 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 from a distance she can eat here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.230
 she has her seventh auto tech this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 and here as a supporter worthy brown for 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.730
 side is brown or saw itself was 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.709
 I like to myself 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.109
 from time to time is recorded what a 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.790
 great range has certainly been on the 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.670
 distance the opponents here eat their 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.970
 set plants and therefore need 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.549
 Japan's degradation is so fat there is nothing 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.010
 through and last as last 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.810
 I pass fifth champion 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.620
 so decide in the middle between 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.659
 Katie These bodies kelly with the expeed 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.519
 that 's the normal one of these shreds 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.709
 Everything goes in slate to whom so 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.560
 Team the lake game down the valley 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.720
 but I believe even more this 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.720
 So global presents would either 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.639
 caijing or katus cartoons people notice 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.549
 he must be banished now 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.829
 helpless is really evil has the multi 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.510
 It does not celebrate any songs either 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.180
 does little harm and if kate 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.010
 winslet likes to come even in the early of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 already had its floor of the drive and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.769
 Relatively sure is a right one 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.849
 driving machine and it is not 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.389
 just kill him 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.409
 because he always has his own which 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.629
 experiments so people 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.690
 that would be my team of five people 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.000
 just comment easily and yes 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.769
 Let's see what I think I think 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.479
 see the sun is shining it is 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.310
 very early in the morning not even nine 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.019
 on saturday and me now 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.060
 got up because I'm really beautiful 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.739
 wants to look a bit brown 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.909
 springing up to the sizzling 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.079
 also a bit sleepy 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.609
 maybe I should go down again 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.590
 all in the gym often 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.849
 maybe I'll make a video 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.810
 a little bit as I exercise train times 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.400
 perhaps also writes at that time 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.329
 comments and that at all 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.220
 would be interested 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.930
 I am your board people and I wish 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.620
 you really horny sunny 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.639
 weekend 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.639
 Until next time
