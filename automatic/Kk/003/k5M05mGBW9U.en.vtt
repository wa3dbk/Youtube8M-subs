cool stuff first off basically you've
got<00:00:43.600> these<00:00:43.870> new<00:00:45.329> blocks<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.660> can<00:00:46.930> be<00:00:47.410> powered

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
got these new blocks that can be powered

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.830 
got these new blocks that can be powered
with<00:00:47.769> redstone<00:00:48.100> it's<00:00:48.910> very<00:00:49.000> simple<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.570> flip

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
with redstone it's very simple you flip

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.069 
with redstone it's very simple you flip
the<00:00:49.930> switch<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:52.000> comes<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.930> it

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
the switch and it comes on and it

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.439 
the switch and it comes on and it
creates<00:00:53.320> light<00:00:53.530> ya<00:00:55.410> ever<00:00:56.410> lie<00:00:56.920> now<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.640> thing

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
creates light ya ever lie now the thing

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.750 
creates light ya ever lie now the thing
is<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.649> light<00:01:00.039> does<00:01:00.250> not<00:01:00.429> continue

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
is that the the light does not continue

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.610 
is that the the light does not continue
you'll<00:01:01.210> notice<00:01:01.570> like<00:01:01.750> if<00:01:01.929> I<00:01:02.079> add<00:01:02.260> some

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
you'll notice like if I add some

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.670 
you'll notice like if I add some
redstone<00:01:02.829> it<00:01:03.519> this<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.390> not<00:01:04.540> can<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:05.290> does<00:01:05.500> not

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
redstone it this is not can it does not

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.440 
redstone it this is not can it does not
conduct<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.970> juice<00:01:07.510> okay<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.430> knock<00:01:09.640> geez

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
conduct the juice okay it's a knock geez

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.380 
conduct the juice okay it's a knock geez
conductor<00:01:11.050> yes<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.920> doesn't<00:01:12.310> do<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.670> however

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
conductor yes it doesn't do that however

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.210 
conductor yes it doesn't do that however
let<00:01:14.110> me<00:01:14.200> show<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.470> something<00:01:14.680> else<00:01:14.890> kind<00:01:15.160> of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
let me show you something else kind of

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.600 
let me show you something else kind of
weird<00:01:15.370> back<00:01:15.760> up<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.090> little<00:01:16.210> bit<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:18.220> other

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
weird back up a little bit with other

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.640 
weird back up a little bit with other
light<00:01:19.060> blocks<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:22.180> be<00:01:22.810> conductive<00:01:23.350> for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
light blocks it will be conductive for

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.670 
light blocks it will be conductive for
one<00:01:23.950> block<00:01:24.340> nice<00:01:25.000> one<00:01:25.480> okay<00:01:26.050> so<00:01:26.110> if<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.650> comes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
one block nice one okay so if it comes

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.520 
one block nice one okay so if it comes
into<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.430> block<00:01:27.730> it'll<00:01:28.690> do<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
into this block it'll do it to the the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.090 
into this block it'll do it to the the
ones<00:01:29.820> adjacent<00:01:31.170> additionally<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.440> will<00:01:32.890> do

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
ones adjacent additionally it will do

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.970 
ones adjacent additionally it will do
that<00:01:33.360> vertically<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:34.510> well<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:35.710> if<00:01:35.860> you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
that vertically as well so like if you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.280 
that vertically as well so like if you
look<00:01:36.130> over<00:01:36.250> here<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:37.180> can<00:01:37.390> see<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.870> flipped<00:01:38.230> the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
look over here you can see I flipped the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.820 
look over here you can see I flipped the
switch<00:01:38.500> boop<00:01:39.310> boop<00:01:39.340> boop<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.320> goes<00:01:41.470> one<00:01:41.710> in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
switch boop boop boop so it goes one in

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.020 
switch boop boop boop so it goes one in
every<00:01:42.370> direction<00:01:42.640> yeah<00:01:43.330> that's<00:01:44.080> awesome<00:01:45.030> so

with the redstone lamp it's a cool
addition<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.960> think<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.770> what<00:05:00.669> would<00:05:01.030> really

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
addition I think that what would really

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330 
addition I think that what would really
make<00:05:01.449> it<00:05:01.690> even<00:05:02.020> cooler<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.530> think<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:03.010> if<00:05:03.190> it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
make it even cooler I think is if it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.980 
make it even cooler I think is if it

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.480 
right-clicked the the the lamp itself to
