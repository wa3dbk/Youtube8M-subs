 this is where the beats out ways 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.079
 value was heard in the live montages 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.260
 It's okay, I can tell you what. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 from the beginning of the fall and here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.520
 candy viewed on the internet only looks 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.590
 there ne 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.710
 logically that what we use in the day 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 to day and was on / off power ne 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.780
 and we have here also the entrance or

 whether it makes recording also if you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 want to record some point is some place 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.630
 orients her recording and our 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 Stereo output here no longer 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 other items here practically in the use of 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 me and everything else does not matter now 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 in front of her 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.280
 Let's start here that we have 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.909
 here we have here are the commands né de 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.340
 des lilac serve that are used to by 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.710
 example is that famous effect 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 the tunnel is that we reduce the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 speed that we know as 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 pichincha that we call the tui 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.840
 people here too feet 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.689
 we have 16 near here from the pier 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 touch sensitive 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.409
 here we have the viewfinder also from where 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 you will carry out your programs 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.040
 do broad exhibits and everything else your 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.810
 experience that does not fall 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 here we have a keyboard symbol of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.860
 computer is 2003 movie means 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.360
 land of functions 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.830
 here we have to know some pages 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.720
 of fans that vary depending on which command 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.280
 Are you running your box here? 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.710
 is the question of rondon not exit the márcia 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.110
 Requiem that the input volume as the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.900
 people spoke back there on the issue of 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.450
 recording are here you control here 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 part of the recording I do not usually use much 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.020
 here are the interesting commands that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.060
 in the part of you producing your program is 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.240
 for you to ride your blood and everything 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.450
 more we put the date button and serves to 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.390
 you move me inside your screen 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.150
 we have here the memories of the banks 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.730
 which is very cool the people who live ab 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.459
 ced means which means 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.910
 when I have a schedule made 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.590
 here at the bank to make continuity 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.170
 My samba is right. 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.090
 I can change a baby where it will me 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.430
 open another 16 feet to do the mounts 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.340
 no ideas like that successively 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.060
 You, at a moment's notice, I can 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.360
 use four banks and then I can say 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.209
 do 48 live shows that 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 depending on what is ready or 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.989
 we can not do the other things 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.350
 assemblies or not twitter 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 between here and there we have the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.010
 hotel is time gives the motto repeat serving 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.800
 for you to have legal effect 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.180
 then you have an ok button ti 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.820
 easy access 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.820
 then this cool team is no more 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.920
 here in the programming question 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.130
 So, this one from our box, he 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.110
 persecuted we start with her 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.110
 is our first video by signing up for 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.360

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.470
 our facebook page beats 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.350
 phenomenon 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.390
 Okay, and we'll continue with this. 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.690
