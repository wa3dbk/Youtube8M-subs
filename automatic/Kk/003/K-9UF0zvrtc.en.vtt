00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
before yeah actually be zoomed in fully

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.700 
before yeah actually be zoomed in fully
zoomed<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.840> like<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.320> feel<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
zoomed in but like that I feel like I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
zoomed in but like that I feel like I
mean<00:01:22.890> I'll<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> didn't<00:01:23.700> kill<00:01:26.689> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
mean I'll see if I'm it didn't kill like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
mean I'll see if I'm it didn't kill like
that<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that much that's pretty much like the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
that much that's pretty much like the
perfect<00:01:29.880> timing<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.159> anything

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
perfect timing that is there anything

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
perfect timing that is there anything
sooner<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.659> gonna<00:01:33.840> land<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> just

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
