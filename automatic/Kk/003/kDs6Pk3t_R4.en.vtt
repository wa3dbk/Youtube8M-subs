00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.930
 today we dedicate our chapter of the course 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.089
 progressive flamenco dance for 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.640
 flamenco on the net to the dance therefore 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.789
 inside the four-stroke compass 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.829
 tango is maybe one of the most dances 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.229
 simple to interpret by part of 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.170
 the people not initiated in the dance 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.539
 flamenco the 4x4 compass is very 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.719
 simple and catchy for those who still 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.820
 they do not perfectly master the rhythms and 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.490
 the flamenco dance techniques let's see 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.159
 how it is done with peace by tango 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.920
 before starting to dance we must 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.530
 know how is the compass that we are going to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 drive if it's easier for them to 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 same as in the chapter before law 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.009
 earlier they can pick up pencil and paper and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.789
 point the sequence of numbers that I 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.250
 I repeat, we point from 1 to 4, 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.830
 then four times and we surround 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.899
 each number one with a circle those go 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.610
 to be the accents that we are going to use in 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.229
 the compass therefore is what it would be 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 simply a measure of four times 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.610
 four I explained it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 ah 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.880
 what we just saw is a single beat 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.500
 to get a full compass one 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.930
 complete sequence for a dance by 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.020
 tango we must repeat it in a row 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.020
 occasions 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 ah 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.980
 in terms of their aesthetic approaches 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.400
 the tangos connect with the awakening of 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.980
 the senses serve to dance the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.290
 alone but also to close others 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.960
 dances with compas related to him 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.630
 such as taranto or 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.200
 tientos we see how we make a mark 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.200
 by thong 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.600
 one 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.310
 simple truth are now encouraged to 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.620
 increase the difficulty a little 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.370
 let's make a call model 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.860
 basic for tangos 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.769
 very slowly that on the left foot what 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.280
 we advance smoothly hit with the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.740
 right 1 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.270
 with the same right foot we turn to 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:00.140
 move back with three steps 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:03.140
 1-2-3 now we make a little zapateado 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.390
 hit with the left double hit with 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.390
 the right hit with the left 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.340
 now we hit once with the right and 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.080
 with the left we wait for them 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.080
 hit times 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.829
 the full call would be left 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:27.030
 next mode 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.030
 and 123 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.580
 tangos are a very important element 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.740
 suggestive inside the clubs of 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.410
 flamenco because its rhythmic 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.630
 helps to generate movements 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.380
 spicy movements of a lot 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.200
 sensuality in dance tango on 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.950
 everything in the woman's dance we can say 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.920
 which is one of its objectives is to call the 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.060
 attention of the other and we get with him 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 well moments of much grace 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.500
 freshness and above all there is a space 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:14.130
 for flirting about the origin of the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.100
 tangos we can finally say that there 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.100
 different theories that talk about their 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.590
 origins it is estimated that tangos are 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.690
 one of the oldest clubs in the 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.240
 Flemish heritage but what does not fit 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.010
 doubt is the multiple varieties that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.010
 of the tangos there is in the low Andalusia 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.990
 ah 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.499
 what are the resources that we can 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.650
 use if we want to perform a dance 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:20.870
 suggestive 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.729
 the movement of the hip is very 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.610
 important in tango dancing in the 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.880
 woman dance the movement of the 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.380
 hip is circular we have to try 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.970
 separate the movement of the waist of the 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.590
 what we do with our hips 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:43.100
 so if I move my hip back 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.979
 I have to lift my foot to 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:52.120
 pronounce this movement with the other 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:52.120
 foot do the same thing so that 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.870
 the circular sense of the dance 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.930
 is going to be transmitted to this part of 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:07.780
 our body the shoulders are also 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.780
 important movement of the shoulders 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.530
 do not
