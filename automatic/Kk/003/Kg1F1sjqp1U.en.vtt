as<00:00:08.730> long<00:00:08.910> as<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.120> keep<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.540> cool<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
as long as you keep it in a cool and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
dark place eat six months I mean I

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
dark place eat six months I mean I
wouldn't<00:00:12.540> keep<00:00:12.750> anything<00:00:13.049> that's<00:00:13.440> oil<00:00:13.740> around

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
wouldn't keep anything that's oil around

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.570 
wouldn't keep anything that's oil around
for<00:00:14.580> longer<00:00:14.790> than<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.160> if<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.340> think

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
for longer than that and if you think

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.800 
for longer than that and if you think
for<00:00:17.609> some<00:00:17.880> reason<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
for some reason you are going to have it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.810 
for some reason you are going to have it
longer<00:00:19.050> than<00:00:19.170> keep<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> refrigerator

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
longer than keep it in the refrigerator

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.310 
longer than keep it in the refrigerator
but<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.000> long<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.600> too<00:00:21.840> hot<00:00:22.080> it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
but as long as it's not too hot it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.769 
but as long as it's not too hot it's
going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.590> fine<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.340> also<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.390> want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.660> be

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
going to be fine and also you want to be

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.779 
going to be fine and also you want to be
careful<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:26.369> took<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
careful because this is they took the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.560 
careful because this is they took the
time<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.449> create<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.429> low-temperature<00:00:29.570> cacao

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
time to create a low-temperature cacao

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
time to create a low-temperature cacao
butter<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.349> any<00:00:31.619> anytime<00:00:32.000> things<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.149> been

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
butter so any anytime things have been

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.459 
butter so any anytime things have been
heated<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.410> different<00:00:35.280> oils<00:00:36.469> go

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
heated to you know different oils go

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
heated to you know different oils go
rancid<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.950> different<00:00:38.280> temperatures<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
rancid at different temperatures so I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.790 
rancid at different temperatures so I
can't<00:00:39.510> say<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:39.989> 18<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.530> anything

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
can't say how much an 18 for anything

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030 
can't say how much an 18 for anything
but<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.690> consideration<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.500> hot

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
but they take into consideration how hot

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
but they take into consideration how hot
the<00:00:44.789> oil<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.390> getting<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.960> they're

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the oil is getting when they're

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
the oil is getting when they're
extracting<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> hot

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
extracting it so if you're doing the hot

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
extracting it so if you're doing the hot
water<00:00:49.079> immersion<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.770> careful<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
water immersion just be careful that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
water immersion just be careful that
it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.000> too<00:00:51.270> hot<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.780> there

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it's not going to get too hot in there

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
it's not going to get too hot in there
as<00:00:52.110> long<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> touch<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.640> hand

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
as long as you can touch it to your hand

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.529 
as long as you can touch it to your hand
you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> hot<00:00:55.199> tub<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.160> 105<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you know a hot tub is what like 105 or

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
you know a hot tub is what like 105 or
90-something<00:00:58.410> degrees<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.010> its<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.309> hot

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
90-something degrees and its really hot

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
90-something degrees and its really hot
that<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.030> melt<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> butter<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.050> not

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that would melt the butter so that's not

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.700 
that would melt the butter so that's not
above<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> temperature<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:04.140> things<00:01:04.379> start

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
above that temperature that things start

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
above that temperature that things start
to<00:01:04.769> lose<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:05.460> integrity<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> aware

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to lose their integrity so just be aware

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
to lose their integrity so just be aware
of<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.820> today's<00:01:09.210> purpose<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
of that but for also today's purpose I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
of that but for also today's purpose I
just<00:01:10.020> chopped<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
just chopped it up and that's going to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.420 
just chopped it up and that's going to
break<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.680> right<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> food

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
break down right here in a food

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.039 
break down right here in a food
processor<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.439> adding<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> then

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
processor so I'm adding that in and then

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
processor so I'm adding that in and then
and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> add<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.460> agave

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and then I'm going to add my agave

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.060 
and then I'm going to add my agave
nectar<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> their<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.470> three<00:01:22.680> quarters
