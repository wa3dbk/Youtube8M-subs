00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389

getting rid of a lot of things and I'm

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.659 
getting rid of a lot of things and I'm
happy<00:05:16.940> about<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.479> I'm<00:05:17.950> trying<00:05:18.950> really

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
happy about that I'm trying really

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.810 
happy about that I'm trying really
trying<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.740> watch<00:05:23.740> what<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.770> do<00:05:24.919> what<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.580> buy

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
trying to watch what I do what I buy

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
trying to watch what I do what I buy
that's<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:28.460> thing<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.030> really<00:05:29.330> suck<00:05:29.810> at

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
that's the thing that I really suck at

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.879 
that's the thing that I really suck at
but<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.349> think<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:31.539> is<00:05:32.539> just<00:05:32.599> a<00:05:33.320> part<00:05:33.680> of

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
but I think that that is just a part of

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.600 
but I think that that is just a part of
being<00:05:34.160> part<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.419> YouTube<00:05:36.610> beauty

community um I think that's it there are
some<00:05:42.950> of<00:05:43.160> you<00:05:43.370> now<00:05:43.880> sandy<00:05:44.479> did<00:05:44.750> tag<00:05:45.169> an<00:05:45.560> awful

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
some of you now sandy did tag an awful

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.200 
some of you now sandy did tag an awful
lot<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.430> people<00:05:46.910> when<00:05:47.630> she<00:05:47.930> did<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.320> tag<00:05:48.590> so

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
lot of people when she did the tag so

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.089 
lot of people when she did the tag so
there<00:05:50.210> were<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.450> few<00:05:50.810> people<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.169> I<00:05:51.560> subscribe

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
there were a few people that I subscribe

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.430 
there were a few people that I subscribe
to<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.639> she<00:05:52.970> probably<00:05:53.419> doesn't<00:05:53.930> subscribe

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
to that she probably doesn't subscribe

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.850 
to that she probably doesn't subscribe
to<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.240> she<00:05:56.240> did<00:05:56.570> not<00:05:56.780> tag<00:05:57.169> you<00:05:57.470> for<00:05:57.710> that

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
to and she did not tag you for that

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.980 
to and she did not tag you for that
reason<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:59.720> I'm<00:06:00.110> sure<00:06:00.410> that<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.919> recent<00:06:01.099> she

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
reason and I'm sure that the recent she

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.300 
reason and I'm sure that the recent she
doesn't<00:06:02.990> subscribe<00:06:03.289> to<00:06:03.680> use<00:06:03.830> because<00:06:04.039> she

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
doesn't subscribe to use because she

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.409 
doesn't subscribe to use because she
just<00:06:04.520> hasn't<00:06:04.789> found<00:06:05.410> you<00:06:06.410> yet<00:06:06.560> so<00:06:07.250> uh<00:06:07.520> there
