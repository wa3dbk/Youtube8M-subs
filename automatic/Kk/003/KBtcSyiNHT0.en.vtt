00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.670 
we're now on the other side of that door

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it's pretty easy you got a little space

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.319 
it's pretty easy you got a little space
it's<00:01:38.680> not<00:01:38.829> as<00:01:39.040> tight<00:01:39.219> as<00:01:39.310> before<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.210> got

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329

that is it ah yeah it's the only thing

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.679 
that is it ah yeah it's the only thing
that<00:01:44.799> door<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.369> stairs<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.119> our<00:01:46.539> than

that door in the stairs and our than

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.959 
that door in the stairs and our than
that<00:01:46.810> you're<00:01:47.070> relatively<00:01:48.070> relatively

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
that you're relatively relatively

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.380 
that you're relatively relatively
covered<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:50.140> one<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.560> really<00:01:50.950> uh<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:52.030> and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
covered this one I really uh I do and

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.609 
covered this one I really uh I do and
don't<00:01:52.600> like<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.990> doesn't<00:01:53.289> really<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.590> much

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
don't like it doesn't really have much

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.039 
don't like it doesn't really have much
around<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.820> don't<00:01:55.090> really<00:01:55.539> have<00:01:55.719> any<00:01:55.930> uh

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
around it so don't really have any uh

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.770 
around it so don't really have any uh
any<00:01:56.560> coverage<00:01:57.460> if<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.759> really<00:01:58.030> need<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.240> the

any coverage if you really need it the

any coverage if you really need it the
only<00:01:58.960> thing<00:01:59.109> it<00:01:59.229> does<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.829> that<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.280> can

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
only thing it does have is that you can

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.010 
only thing it does have is that you can
always<00:02:00.759> buy<00:02:00.969> that<00:02:01.210> door<00:02:01.359> and<00:02:01.509> forfeit<00:02:01.899> your

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
go in the back I think that would uh

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.760 
go in the back I think that would uh
that<00:02:25.570> would<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.720> phenomenal<00:02:25.960> I'd<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> pretty

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
that would be phenomenal I'd be a pretty

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.880 
that would be phenomenal I'd be a pretty
cool<00:02:27.040> spot<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.660> speaking<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.690> which<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.230> just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
cool spot and speaking of which I just

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
cool spot and speaking of which I just
remembered<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.340> actually<00:02:30.490> do<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.820> four<00:02:31.150> spots

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
remembered I actually do have four spots

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.390 
remembered I actually do have four spots
if<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.170> go<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.500> way<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.950> go<00:02:33.070> over<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
if we go this way and we go over to the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.030 
if we go this way and we go over to the
main<00:02:33.550> hub<00:02:34.320> where<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.380> run<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.680> one<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
main hub where you run this one you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.860 
main hub where you run this one you
haven't<00:02:36.190> open<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> door<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.540> showed<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
haven't open the door that I showed you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.500 
haven't open the door that I showed you
before<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.520> can<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.670> camp<00:02:40.360> out

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
before you can you can just camp out

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.330 
before you can you can just camp out
right<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.410> gives<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.070> all<00:02:42.220> you

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
right here it gives you if you all you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.680 
right here it gives you if you all you
guys<00:02:42.460> go<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> corner<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.180> gives<00:02:43.330> us<00:02:43.450> all

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
guys go in the corner it gives us all

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.940 
guys go in the corner it gives us all
place<00:02:43.930> thrown<00:02:44.140> around<00:02:44.290> try<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.770> get<00:02:44.860> away

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
place thrown around try and get away

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.190 
place thrown around try and get away
from<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.280> zombies<00:02:45.700> if<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.330> really<00:02:46.570> need<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.750> I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
from the zombies if you really need to I

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530 
from the zombies if you really need to I
think<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.160> probably<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.730> single<00:02:49.150> best<00:02:49.240> spot

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
think this probably the single best spot

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.810 
think this probably the single best spot
you<00:02:50.320> can<00:02:50.470> probably<00:02:50.740> can't<00:02:51.220> plus<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.670> can

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
you can probably can't plus you can

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.130 
you can probably can't plus you can
always<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.120> out<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.390> Courtyard<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:52.990> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
always get out to the Courtyard for a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.080 
always get out to the Courtyard for a
relatively<00:02:53.560> cheap<00:02:53.920> amount<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.280> points<00:02:54.460> of

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
relatively cheap amount of points of

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.190 
relatively cheap amount of points of
course<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.600> little<00:02:55.810> things<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.140> know

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
course you have little things you know

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.600 
course you have little things you know
like<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.530> elevators<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.250> stuff<00:02:57.460> like<00:02:57.520> that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
like the elevators and stuff like that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.610 
like the elevators and stuff like that
if<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.910> really<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.990> don't

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
if you really want to do that I don't

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.590 
if you really want to do that I don't
recommend<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> fourth<00:03:01.180> spots<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
recommend it I think the fourth spots I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.780 
recommend it I think the fourth spots I
shared<00:03:01.990> in<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.140> video<00:03:02.320> are<00:03:02.790> relatively

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
shared in this video are relatively

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.030 
shared in this video are relatively
relatively<00:03:04.450> good<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.960> speaking<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.650> which<00:03:05.800> we

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
relatively good and speaking of which we

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.490 
relatively good and speaking of which we
are<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.400> next<00:03:06.640> round<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:08.260> wanted

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
are on the next round so I just wanted
