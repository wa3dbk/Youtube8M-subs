to know is that this review is really

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.069 
to know is that this review is really
more<00:00:27.250> about<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.730> performance<00:00:28.509> when<00:00:28.930> we

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
more about the performance when we

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.810 
more about the performance when we
compare<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.529> two<00:00:29.560> mowers<00:00:30.009> but<00:00:30.489> there<00:00:30.640> are

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
compare the two mowers but there are

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.609 
compare the two mowers but there are
some<00:00:31.450> things<00:00:31.660> we<00:00:31.779> need<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:31.989> point<00:00:32.230> out<00:00:32.410> here

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
some things we need to point out here

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.110 
some things we need to point out here
that<00:00:32.739> are<00:00:32.770> pretty<00:00:32.980> obvious<00:00:33.190> first<00:00:33.610> of<00:00:33.820> all<00:00:33.940> is

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
that are pretty obvious first of all is

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.389 
that are pretty obvious first of all is
my<00:00:34.300> Toro<00:00:34.899> super<00:00:35.260> recyclers<00:00:35.739> rear-wheel<00:00:36.370> drive

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
my Toro super recyclers rear-wheel drive

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.840 
my Toro super recyclers rear-wheel drive
and<00:00:36.730> Jake's<00:00:37.120> recycler<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.170> front-wheel<00:00:38.710> drive

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
and Jake's recycler is front-wheel drive

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.060 
and Jake's recycler is front-wheel drive
you<00:00:39.850> can<00:00:40.060> get<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.570> recycler<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.710> rear-wheel

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
you can get the recycler in a rear-wheel

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.770 
you can get the recycler in a rear-wheel
drive<00:00:42.100> with<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.700> personal<00:00:43.060> pace<00:00:43.240> system<00:00:43.600> so

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
drive with the personal pace system so

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.390 
drive with the personal pace system so
that's<00:00:44.170> only<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.440> difference<00:00:44.830> just<00:00:44.890> because<00:00:45.130> of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
that's only a difference just because of

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.620 
that's only a difference just because of
the<00:00:45.460> way<00:00:45.580> we<00:00:45.700> purchased<00:00:46.120> here<00:00:46.240> it's<00:00:46.450> not

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
the way we purchased here it's not

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.000 
the way we purchased here it's not
something<00:00:47.050> that's<00:00:47.140> going<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.650> really<00:00:47.890> change

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
something that's going to really change

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.980 
something that's going to really change
the<00:00:48.310> performance<00:00:48.520> too<00:00:49.030> much<00:00:49.210> though<00:00:49.480> another

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
the performance too much though another

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.660 
the performance too much though another
thing<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.350> realize<00:00:50.650> is<00:00:50.830> that<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> recycler<00:00:51.550> is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
thing to realize is that the recycler is

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.940 
thing to realize is that the recycler is
actually<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.090> 22<00:00:52.570> inch<00:00:52.720> cut<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.350> super<00:00:53.800> is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
actually a 22 inch cut and the super is

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually a 22 inch cut and the super is
only<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.220> 21<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.760> as<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.150> told<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.570> in<00:00:55.630> another

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
only a 21 and as I told you in another

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.020 
only a 21 and as I told you in another
video<00:00:56.080> ask<00:00:56.860> your<00:00:57.160> girlfriend<00:00:57.400> she'll<00:00:57.820> tell

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
video ask your girlfriend she'll tell

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.370 
video ask your girlfriend she'll tell
you<00:00:58.090> how<00:00:58.210> much<00:00:58.330> that<00:00:58.540> extra<00:00:58.870> inch<00:00:59.020> really

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
you how much that extra inch really

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.319 
you how much that extra inch really
means<00:00:59.590> so<00:01:00.100> there's<00:01:00.280> one<00:01:00.550> advantage<00:01:01.060> to<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
means so there's one advantage to the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.720 
means so there's one advantage to the
old<00:01:01.450> recycler<00:01:02.020> now<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.010> other<00:01:03.190> thing<00:01:03.430> here<00:01:03.610> is

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
old recycler now the other thing here is

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.160 
old recycler now the other thing here is
going<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:03.970> be<00:01:04.089> cost<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.750> what's<00:01:04.900> interesting

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
going to be cost and what's interesting

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.590 
going to be cost and what's interesting
is<00:01:05.470> both<00:01:05.799> of<00:01:05.950> these<00:01:06.040> are<00:01:06.189> based<00:01:06.430> models<00:01:06.939> so<00:01:07.390> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
is both of these are based models so the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.359 
is both of these are based models so the
recycler<00:01:08.079> on<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.320> right<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.890> base<00:01:09.100> model

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
recycler on the right is the base model

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.819 
recycler on the right is the base model
or<00:01:09.729> entry-level<00:01:10.240> recycler<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.140> my<00:01:11.500> super

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
or entry-level recycler and my super

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.889 
or entry-level recycler and my super
recycler<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.399> actually<00:01:12.789> an<00:01:12.880> entry-level<00:01:13.210> also

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
recycler is actually an entry-level also

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.719 
recycler is actually an entry-level also
now<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> difference<00:01:14.619> in<00:01:14.740> price<00:01:14.950> that's<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.549> big

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
now the difference in price that's a big

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.559 
now the difference in price that's a big
deal<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.479> recycler<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.590> was<00:01:18.149> $279<00:01:19.149> at<00:01:19.329> Home

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
deal the recycler it was $279 at Home

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.770 
deal the recycler it was $279 at Home
Depot<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.140> my<00:01:20.740> super<00:01:21.189> recycler<00:01:21.609> was<00:01:21.789> 499<00:01:22.749> and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
Depot and my super recycler was 499 and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.779 
Depot and my super recycler was 499 and
I<00:01:22.990> bought<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.319> from<00:01:23.439> my<00:01:23.649> local<00:01:23.950> lawnmower<00:01:24.579> shop

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
I bought it from my local lawnmower shop

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.550 
I bought it from my local lawnmower shop
and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:25.749> the<00:01:25.840> other<00:01:25.990> question<00:01:26.139> a<00:01:26.380> lot<00:01:26.469> of

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
and then the other question a lot of

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.109 
and then the other question a lot of
people<00:01:26.740> ask<00:01:26.859> is<00:01:27.039> why<00:01:27.249> do<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:27.490> call<00:01:27.639> the<00:01:27.789> super

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
people ask is why do they call the super

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.940 
people ask is why do they call the super
recycler<00:01:28.600> super<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.170> here's<00:01:29.560> why<00:01:29.740> it's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
recycler super and here's why it's

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.010 
recycler super and here's why it's
underneath<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.460> deck<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:31.329> can<00:01:31.479> go<00:01:31.659> ahead<00:01:31.780> and

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
underneath the deck you can go ahead and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.440 
underneath the deck you can go ahead and
see<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:32.289> there's<00:01:33.189> these<00:01:33.399> two<00:01:33.460> like<00:01:33.909> wedges

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
see that there's these two like wedges

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.330 
see that there's these two like wedges
under<00:01:34.630> there<00:01:34.869> what<00:01:35.319> those<00:01:35.469> wedges<00:01:35.679> do<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.159> when

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
under there what those wedges do is when

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.830 
under there what those wedges do is when
the<00:01:36.520> blade<00:01:36.759> is<00:01:36.789> spinning<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.420> cuts<00:01:37.659> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the blade is spinning and cuts the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.539 
the blade is spinning and cuts the
clippings<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.469> wedges<00:01:38.740> instead<00:01:39.249> of<00:01:39.340> letting

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
clippings the wedges instead of letting

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.279 
clippings the wedges instead of letting
them<00:01:39.609> stay<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.090> outside<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.869> deck<00:01:41.020> it

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
them stay to the outside of the deck it

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.819 
them stay to the outside of the deck it
they<00:01:41.979> deflect<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> clippings<00:01:43.420> back<00:01:43.810> into<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
they deflect the clippings back into the

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.919 
they deflect the clippings back into the
blade<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.670> they<00:01:45.789> can<00:01:45.939> be<00:01:46.090> ground<00:01:46.659> up<00:01:46.780> into

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
blade so they can be ground up into

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.469 
blade so they can be ground up into
bigger<00:01:47.229> bit<00:01:47.530> smaller<00:01:48.009> bits<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.939> other<00:01:49.149> thing

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
bigger bit smaller bits the other thing

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.910 
bigger bit smaller bits the other thing
is<00:01:49.630> there's<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:49.869> wing<00:01:50.350> that's<00:01:50.590> over<00:01:50.829> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
is there's this wing that's over the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.069 
is there's this wing that's over the
blade<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.520> wing<00:01:51.789> kind<00:01:52.149> of<00:01:52.209> pushes<00:01:52.630> more<00:01:52.869> air

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
blade that wing kind of pushes more air

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.599 
blade that wing kind of pushes more air
again<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.920> keep<00:01:54.069> everything<00:01:54.399> moving

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
again to keep everything moving

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.160 
again to keep everything moving
underneath<00:01:55.359> there<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:55.719> you<00:01:55.810> have<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> wedges

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
underneath there so you have the wedges

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.109 
underneath there so you have the wedges
pushing<00:01:56.649> everything<00:01:56.859> into<00:01:57.459> the<00:01:57.579> middle<00:01:57.939> to

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
pushing everything into the middle to

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.910 
pushing everything into the middle to
get<00:01:58.209> ground<00:01:58.509> up<00:01:58.689> into<00:01:58.840> smaller<00:01:59.469> bits<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.859> you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
get ground up into smaller bits and you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.590 
get ground up into smaller bits and you
have<00:02:00.039> these<00:02:00.130> wings<00:02:00.429> have<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:00.939> creating<00:02:01.479> this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
have these wings have with creating this

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.719 
have these wings have with creating this
airflow<00:02:02.079> that<00:02:02.590> keeps<00:02:02.799> everything<00:02:03.069> moving<00:02:03.399> so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
airflow that keeps everything moving so

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.730 
airflow that keeps everything moving so
that's<00:02:04.119> why<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.479> super<00:02:04.869> recycler<00:02:05.349> is<00:02:05.409> super

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
that's why the super recycler is super

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.529 
that's why the super recycler is super
and<00:02:05.859> with<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.279> let's<00:02:06.579> start<00:02:06.639> a<00:02:06.880> review<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
and with that let's start a review and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.420 
and with that let's start a review and
let's<00:02:07.959> do<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> side-by-side<00:02:08.470> mowing<00:02:09.459> pass

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.920 

okay<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.490> now<00:02:13.880> we're<00:02:14.090> gonna<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.390> some<00:02:14.600> test

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
okay so now we're gonna do some test

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.630 
okay so now we're gonna do some test
cuts<00:02:15.260> between<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.830> two<00:02:16.010> we've<00:02:16.160> got<00:02:16.190> them<00:02:16.460> both

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
cuts between the two we've got them both

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.730 
cuts between the two we've got them both
raised<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.330> same<00:02:17.510> height<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.320> now<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:18.500> can

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
raised to the same height so now we can

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.470 
raised to the same height so now we can
look<00:02:18.890> at<00:02:19.040> how<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.760> cut<00:02:20.030> looks<00:02:20.300> between

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
look at how the the cut looks between

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.940 
look at how the the cut looks between
the<00:02:20.840> two<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.440> then<00:02:21.530> after<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.770> we're<00:02:21.890> gonna

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the two and then after that we're gonna

00:02:21.950 --> 00:03:07.720 
the two and then after that we're gonna
talk<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.280> how<00:02:22.430> they<00:02:22.610> feel<00:02:22.820> when<00:02:23.030> they<00:02:23.060> cut

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.280 

tell<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:08.820> what<00:03:08.940> you're<00:03:09.060> seeing<00:03:09.210> so<00:03:09.510> what<00:03:10.230> are

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
tell me what you're seeing so what are

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
tell me what you're seeing so what are
you<00:03:10.380> noticing<00:03:10.500> I'm<00:03:11.100> noticing<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.670> mine

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
you noticing I'm noticing that mine

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.060 
you noticing I'm noticing that mine
weaves<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.780> bit<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.170> grass<00:03:13.440> while<00:03:13.770> yours

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
weaves a little bit of grass while yours

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.330 
weaves a little bit of grass while yours
is<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:15.290> taking<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> grass<00:03:16.740> right<00:03:17.070> so

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
is actually taking up the grass right so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.370 
is actually taking up the grass right so
that<00:03:17.520> would<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.910> super<00:03:18.420> recycler<00:03:19.020> coming

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that would be that super recycler coming

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
that would be that super recycler coming
in<00:03:19.500> right<00:03:19.710> right<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.460> super

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
in right right because it's super

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.670 
in right right because it's super
recycling<00:03:21.360> yeah<00:03:21.810> we're<00:03:22.050> noticing<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.410> okay

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
recycling yeah we're noticing that okay

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.650 
recycling yeah we're noticing that okay
good<00:03:22.830> let's<00:03:22.950> put<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> lawnmowers<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.940> okay<00:03:24.600> so

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
good let's put the lawnmowers up okay so

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.180 
good let's put the lawnmowers up okay so
here's<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.990> two<00:03:25.200> cuts<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.710> Jake<00:03:25.890> what's<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
here's the two cuts so Jake what's the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.470 
here's the two cuts so Jake what's the
first<00:03:26.370> thing<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.670> notice<00:03:26.820> between<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.330> two

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
first thing you notice between the two

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.940 
first thing you notice between the two
cuts<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.280> Toro<00:03:29.580> recycler<00:03:30.410> as<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.770> went

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
cuts the the Toro recycler as it went

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.680 
cuts the the Toro recycler as it went
through<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:33.060> lawn

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
through this this lawn

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.200 
through this this lawn
left<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.440> little<00:03:34.470> bit<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.830> grass<00:03:35.190> behind<00:03:35.550> yeah

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
left a little bit of grass behind yeah

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.870 
left a little bit of grass behind yeah
while<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.050> super<00:03:37.350> recycler<00:03:37.890> absolutely

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
while the super recycler absolutely

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.530 
while the super recycler absolutely
didn't<00:03:39.810> leave<00:03:40.370> much<00:03:41.370> cooking<00:03:41.790> behind<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.390> it

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
didn't leave much cooking behind like it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.750 
didn't leave much cooking behind like it
looks<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.960> very<00:03:43.170> clean<00:03:43.410> pass<00:03:43.800> right<00:03:44.430> very

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
looks like a very clean pass right very

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.340 
looks like a very clean pass right very
good<00:03:45.000> exactly<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.870> would<00:03:45.960> be<00:03:46.110> what

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
good exactly right so that would be what

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.110 
good exactly right so that would be what
that's<00:03:46.530> super<00:03:46.920> recycling<00:03:47.460> quality<00:03:47.940> right

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that's super recycling quality right

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.790 
that's super recycling quality right
right<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.630> actually<00:03:48.840> super<00:03:49.380> recycling<00:03:49.920> yep

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
right it's actually super recycling yep

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.990 
right it's actually super recycling yep
okay<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:52.890> now<00:03:53.070> what<00:03:53.190> we're<00:03:53.310> gonna<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.820> we're

okay so now what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.510> use<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:55.050> mowers<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.530> we're<00:03:55.620> gonna

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
going to use the mowers and we're gonna

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.190 
going to use the mowers and we're gonna
see<00:03:55.980> which<00:03:56.160> one<00:03:56.400> we<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.850> best<00:03:57.120> from<00:03:57.960> just

of<00:05:19.919> why<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.220> don't<00:05:20.729> like<00:05:20.910> front-wheel<00:05:21.330> drive

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
of why I don't like front-wheel drive

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.330 
of why I don't like front-wheel drive
mowers<00:05:22.020> just<00:05:22.319> really<00:05:22.770> hard<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.069> control

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
mowers just really hard to control

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.650 
mowers just really hard to control
everything's<00:05:23.849> hopping<00:05:24.180> around<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:24.509> that's

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
everything's hopping around but that's

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.700 
everything's hopping around but that's
me<00:05:24.780> I'm<00:05:24.900> not<00:05:25.020> used<00:05:25.199> to<00:05:25.289> using<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.620> that's

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
me I'm not used to using it that's

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.960 
me I'm not used to using it that's
Jake's<00:05:26.039> mower<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.430> he<00:05:26.520> uses<00:05:26.639> all<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:26.910> time

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
Jake's mower that he uses all the time

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.180 
Jake's mower that he uses all the time
so<00:05:27.360> what<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:28.259> think<00:05:28.530> Jake<00:05:28.710> between<00:05:29.039> the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
so what do you think Jake between the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.570 
so what do you think Jake between the
two<00:05:29.370> just<00:05:29.610> power<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.300> ease<00:05:30.479> of<00:05:30.509> use<00:05:30.690> well<00:05:31.580> even

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
two just power and ease of use well even

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.279 
two just power and ease of use well even
though<00:05:32.699> I've<00:05:32.849> had<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.060> lot<00:05:33.539> of<00:05:33.630> experience<00:05:34.169> with

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
though I've had a lot of experience with

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.980 
though I've had a lot of experience with
the<00:05:34.440> toro<00:05:34.710> recycler<00:05:35.430> I<00:05:35.699> still<00:05:36.539> prefer<00:05:36.690> the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the toro recycler I still prefer the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.800 
the toro recycler I still prefer the
Toro<00:05:37.259> super<00:05:37.680> recycler<00:05:38.130> because<00:05:38.520> how<00:05:39.240> fast<00:05:39.599> you

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
Toro super recycler because how fast you

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.779 
Toro super recycler because how fast you
walk<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.319> how<00:05:40.470> fast<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:40.979> mow<00:05:41.160> instead<00:05:41.669> of

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
walk is how fast you mow instead of

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.600 
walk is how fast you mow instead of
having<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.630> keep<00:05:42.780> up<00:05:42.960> with<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.289> pace<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.160> it

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
having to keep up with the pace and it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.129 
having to keep up with the pace and it
gives<00:05:44.789> you<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.940> much<00:05:45.120> straighter<00:05:45.479> cut<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.050> a

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
gives you a much straighter cut and a

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.080 
gives you a much straighter cut and a
much<00:05:46.319> cleaner<00:05:46.590> cut<00:05:46.919> quality<00:05:47.130> there<00:05:47.729> you<00:05:47.819> go<00:05:47.940> so

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
much cleaner cut quality there you go so

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.550 
much cleaner cut quality there you go so
he<00:05:48.180> likes<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.509> personal<00:05:48.990> pace<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.289> I<00:05:49.349> think

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
he likes that personal pace and I think

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.990 
he likes that personal pace and I think
that<00:05:49.680> might<00:05:49.860> be<00:05:49.889> available<00:05:50.220> on<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.729> Toro

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
that might be available on the Toro

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.719 
that might be available on the Toro
recycler<00:05:51.659> also<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.199> my<00:05:52.740> super<00:05:53.190> recycler<00:05:53.550> does

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
recycler also and my super recycler does

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:54.920 
recycler also and my super recycler does
have<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:53.970> personal<00:05:54.300> pace<00:05:54.419> which<00:05:54.599> you<00:05:54.720> like

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
have the personal pace which you like

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.510 
have the personal pace which you like
but<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.560> whole<00:05:55.740> thing<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.039> again<00:05:56.250> it's<00:05:56.430> that

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
but the whole thing is again it's that

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.370 
but the whole thing is again it's that
clean-cut<00:05:56.909> quality<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.780> you<00:05:58.020> can<00:05:58.139> feel<00:05:58.289> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
clean-cut quality and you can feel the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.499 
clean-cut quality and you can feel the
power<00:05:58.560> but<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.770> will<00:05:58.949> say<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.639> Toro<00:05:59.909> recycler

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
power but I will say the Toro recycler

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.600 
power but I will say the Toro recycler
does<00:06:00.780> have<00:06:01.020> plenty<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.440> power<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:02.039> does<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.340> nice

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
does have plenty of power it does a nice

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.999 
does have plenty of power it does a nice
job<00:06:02.909> so<00:06:03.090> it's<00:06:03.210> not<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.419> weak<00:06:03.750> lawnmower<00:06:04.319> it<00:06:04.680> just

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
job so it's not a weak lawnmower it just

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.100 
job so it's not a weak lawnmower it just
doesn't<00:06:05.310> have<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.580> same<00:06:05.880> solid<00:06:06.509> feel<00:06:06.810> that

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
doesn't have that same solid feel that

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.480 
doesn't have that same solid feel that
the<00:06:07.199> super<00:06:07.560> recycler<00:06:08.009> has<00:06:08.159> wouldn't<00:06:08.430> you
