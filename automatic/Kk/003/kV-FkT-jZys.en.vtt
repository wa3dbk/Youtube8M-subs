hollow bolts wait I'm a few hasn't even

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.479 
hollow bolts wait I'm a few hasn't even
they're<00:00:49.649> horrible

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
they're horrible

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.650 
they're horrible
I<00:00:52.460> ran<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.510> good

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I ran this them it was a pretty good

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
I ran this them it was a pretty good
slam<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
slam but like it's kind of one of the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
slam but like it's kind of one of the
cons<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> bet<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:59.070> designed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
cons to this mean the bet was designed

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.750 
cons to this mean the bet was designed
it<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> cuz<00:01:00.649> regularly<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.980> four<00:01:02.370> bolts

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it is cuz regularly you have four bolts

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
it is cuz regularly you have four bolts
but<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.690> mean<00:01:03.899> six<00:01:04.260> bolts<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.070> mean

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but I mean six bolts with this I mean

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.130 
but I mean six bolts with this I mean
the<00:01:05.519> side<00:01:05.880> pinch<00:01:06.210> bolts<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.720> top<00:01:06.930> boots

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the side pinch bolts and the top boots

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
the side pinch bolts and the top boots
but<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> only<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.880> only

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
but on this one you only it only

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.420 
but on this one you only it only
requires<00:01:09.479> full<00:01:09.869> four<00:01:10.380> bolts<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> uses<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
requires full four bolts and it uses a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.289 
requires full four bolts and it uses a
6mm<00:01:12.119> hex<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.040> other<00:01:14.250> stems<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.090> um

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
6mm hex so just like other stems but um

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
6mm hex so just like other stems but um
that's<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.560> thing<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that's about this thing there's a lot of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's about this thing there's a lot of
people<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.030> knee<00:01:18.780> hits<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.200> stem<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
doesn't happen with this because it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480
