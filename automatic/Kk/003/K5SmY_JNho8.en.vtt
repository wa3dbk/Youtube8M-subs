 video and as a fetched then 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.389
 cheever ps4 I would go for it 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.990
 let me know a series in the comments if 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.990
 you might be interested 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.400
 let 's start the video well well 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.359
 nice to all the guys today 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.390
 we are therefore a robot wall man and today 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.850
 we have three special goals to do 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.859
 as they have been conciliatory to you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.589
 in fact the series now frames that way 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.680
 have goals created by you that 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.210
 read below in the comments 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 we start immediately anyway we draw the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.330
 goals you will see in 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.390
 overlay over the voltages above 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.929
 good every day look for and destroy 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.060
 veteran I do not know if already started but in 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.159
 in case it has already started and in any case the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 matches are two therefore we pass by 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.860
 get him in the next race start with 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.549
 the first is not possible 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.729
 let's make sure ok first with the first if 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.119
 we succeed the first believes as we have 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.700
 Read the foot shooter mouse 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.700
 freshly baked when we see where 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.760
 no no 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 by and wickedness and bad this is beautiful 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.600
 to make Italian decisions because here 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.270
 they were all like that now 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.640
 but trying to kill, let's see 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.300
 we see the smurfs as a class now 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:22.459
 explain the hosting but this does not engage 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 live or my god there is a showy around 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.920

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.440
 now intermezzo therefore we will try to 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.150
 to add more laughter circles and much 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.980
 let me base my want to put us here though 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.379
 I'm in the hard way I know what the fuck 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.379

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 here 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.560
 I can't do this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.560
 from football though 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.900
 defuse and give from you give from Roma 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:19.080

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:23.300

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.659
 impossible I made more mess of everything 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.659
 the casino of the module but kick ass 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:21.310
 too easy problem is that then will have to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.539
 do a dozen Belgian flight in my opinion 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.039
 or maybe I'm getting old 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:31.229
 and I give space to young people 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:39.310

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:40.990

 make the match with goals over three 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.970
 I did it for round two because 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.230
 at the end later if I put you there 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.540

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.220
 funny and they were so boring 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.190
