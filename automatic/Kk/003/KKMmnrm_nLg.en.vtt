 erotic one of the coolest 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 telefonchik here but at that time in general 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 used to love the phone from sony 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.400
 ericsson were probably not the best 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.129
 at that moment, there is already some pressure 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.970
 the whole shabby phone was bought 2006 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 the phone itself came out in January 2006 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.799
 years that is it is already possible to say this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.019

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 I used to have better phones 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.800
 before 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.500
 more do more screens there are spades 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.370
 such 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 But in design and in everything, how would they not 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 different yes all rectangular 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.940
 Well, a little bit at the Samsung happens 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.900
 year year a year nothing new under 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 almost no shows and early who 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.450
 remembers when the era of telephones began before 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.250
 started to produce various forms too 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.400
