on times four hours five hours things
like<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.070> i<00:03:28.130> didn't<00:03:28.459> drain<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.760> all<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
like that but i didn't drain it all the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.250 
like that but i didn't drain it all the
way<00:03:29.030> down<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.390> i<00:03:29.450> can't<00:03:29.660> really<00:03:29.750> say<00:03:30.080> that

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
way down so i can't really say that

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.080 
way down so i can't really say that
either<00:03:30.620> way<00:03:30.890> definitely<00:03:31.580> very<00:03:31.880> very

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
either way definitely very very

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.880 
either way definitely very very
impressive<00:03:32.480> now<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.140> does<00:03:33.320> not<00:03:33.500> support

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
impressive now it does not support

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.260 
impressive now it does not support
wireless<00:03:34.130> charging<00:03:34.550> out<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.880> box<00:03:35.060> that's

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
wireless charging out of the box that's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.790 
wireless charging out of the box that's
a<00:03:35.420> bit<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.720> bummer<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.410> can<00:03:36.560> buy<00:03:36.680> an

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
a bit of a bummer but you can buy an

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.440 
a bit of a bummer but you can buy an
accessory<00:03:37.310> after<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.610> fact<00:03:37.700> i<00:03:38.060> believe<00:03:38.090> it's

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
accessory after the fact i believe it's

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.479 
accessory after the fact i believe it's
the<00:03:38.570> quick<00:03:38.810> circle<00:03:39.200> charging<00:03:39.650> case<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.190> it

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the quick circle charging case and it

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.850 
the quick circle charging case and it
adds<00:03:40.640> qi<00:03:40.940> charging<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.200> again<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.800> a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
adds qi charging to it so again it's a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.080 
adds qi charging to it so again it's a
bit<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.100> bummer<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.430> doesn't<00:03:43.670> come<00:03:43.790> with<00:03:43.820> it

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
bit of a bummer it doesn't come with it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.670 
bit of a bummer it doesn't come with it
but<00:03:44.300> at<00:03:44.420> least<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.750> can<00:03:44.989> add<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.380> after<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
but at least you can add it after the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.470 
but at least you can add it after the
fact<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.160> from<00:03:46.430> what<00:03:46.550> i<00:03:46.580> understand<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.239> does

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
fact and from what i understand it does

fact and from what i understand it does

up an awful lot of space and taking a

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.440 
up an awful lot of space and taking a
bit<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.550> weird<00:04:22.760> left<00:04:23.000> turn

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
bit of a weird left turn

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.140 
bit of a weird left turn
or<00:04:23.660> at<00:04:23.840> least<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.110> top<00:04:24.500> turn<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.400> IR<00:04:25.580> blaster

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
or at least a top turn the IR blaster

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.450 
or at least a top turn the IR blaster
again<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.780> normally<00:04:27.170> don't<00:04:27.290> watch<00:04:27.530> much<00:04:27.740> TV<00:04:28.010> so

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
again I normally don't watch much TV so

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.680 
again I normally don't watch much TV so
I<00:04:28.490> didn't<00:04:28.850> think<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.180> would<00:04:29.270> care<00:04:29.510> much

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
I didn't think that I would care much

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.450 
I didn't think that I would care much
about<00:04:29.720> having<00:04:30.200> an<00:04:30.320> IR<00:04:30.620> blaster<00:04:31.010> in<00:04:31.100> my<00:04:31.190> device

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
about having an IR blaster in my device

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.550 
about having an IR blaster in my device
but<00:04:31.850> then<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.060> realized<00:04:32.540> that<00:04:32.660> most<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.260> TVs

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
but then I realized that most of the TVs

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.950 
but then I realized that most of the TVs
in<00:04:33.590> my<00:04:33.830> house<00:04:33.980> are<00:04:34.280> all<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.610> same<00:04:34.790> brand<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.420> I

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
in my house are all the same brand and I

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.200 
in my house are all the same brand and I
was<00:04:36.350> able<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.560> set<00:04:36.770> up<00:04:36.890> one<00:04:37.160> remote<00:04:37.550> profile<00:04:38.000> on

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
was able to set up one remote profile on

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.210 
was able to set up one remote profile on
here<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.570> could<00:04:38.660> control<00:04:39.050> all<00:04:39.320> of<00:04:39.380> them<00:04:39.890> and

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
here that could control all of them and

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.740 
here that could control all of them and
all<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> have<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.700> do<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:40.940> swipe<00:04:41.150> right<00:04:41.420> for<00:04:41.480> my

pretty<00:05:17.120> much<00:05:17.450> exactly<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:18.200> focus<00:05:18.710> just<00:05:18.980> how

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
pretty much exactly in focus just how

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.530 
pretty much exactly in focus just how
you'd<00:05:19.310> want<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.700> be<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:20.090> even<00:05:20.390> does

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
you'd want it to be it even does

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.750 
you'd want it to be it even does
decently<00:05:20.990> in<00:05:21.170> low<00:05:21.350> light<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.800> has<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:22.070> f<00:05:22.250> 1.8

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
decently in low light it has that f 1.8

decently in low light it has that f 1.8
aperture<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.330> back<00:05:23.450> line<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:23.900> you<00:05:23.960> would

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
aperture on the back line so you would

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.080 
aperture on the back line so you would
expect<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:24.830> pretty<00:05:25.070> well<00:05:25.280> for<00:05:25.550> videos

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
expect it to do pretty well for videos

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.390 
expect it to do pretty well for videos
it<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.390> equally<00:05:26.810> awesome<00:05:27.020> as<00:05:27.350> well<00:05:27.380> it's<00:05:27.860> got<00:05:28.100> 3

30 megabits per second right now which

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.480 
30 megabits per second right now which

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
is a little bit low for 4k I've heard of

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.160 
is a little bit low for 4k I've heard of
some<00:05:40.580> other<00:05:40.730> people's<00:05:41.030> g4s<00:05:41.510> doing<00:05:41.720> 48

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
some other people's g4s doing 48

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
megabits per second which is also what

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.820 
megabits per second which is also what
the<00:05:43.970> galaxy<00:05:44.480> s6<00:05:44.810> does<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.410> I<00:05:45.530> would<00:05:45.650> assume

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
the galaxy s6 does and I would assume

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.170 
the galaxy s6 does and I would assume
it's<00:05:46.010> just<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.280> matter<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.670> simple<00:05:47.000> software

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
it's just a matter of a simple software
