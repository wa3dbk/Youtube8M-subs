Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:09.935
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:21.275
First, let’s make the marinade.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:24.248
In a small pot, combine the sake 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.761
and the mirin.  

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:29.883
Turn on the burner.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:34.387
Bring it to a boil and let the alcohol evaporate 

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:37.221
until you can’t smell it anymore.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.891
Now, it is ready.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.441
Pour the mixture onto a plate.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:50.827
Then, add the vinegar, 

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.736
yuzu citrus juice, 

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.041
dashi kombu seaweed, 

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.236
dried red chili pepper 

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:02.422
and soy sauce.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:04.854
Stir to mix.  

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.945
You can use any type of sour citrus juice 

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:10.130
instead of the yuzu juice.

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:14.785
Next, make numerous cuts 

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:17.742
along the long green onion diagonally.

00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.108
The small cuts will help it to absorb the flavor 

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:23.843
and also help soften the texture.

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:29.412
Then, cut the onion into 4cm (1.6”) pieces.

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:34.951
As for the bell pepper, cut it the same size as the onion.

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:40.052
Now, let’s make the Salmon Yakizuke.

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.321
Add the sake to the salmon.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.137
And coat both sides evenly.

00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:54.374
Next, add the vegetable oil to a pan.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.143
Turn on the burner 

00:01:57.422 --> 00:02:01.311
and add the long green onion and the bell pepper.

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:05.998
Stir-fry the vegetables.

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.249
You can also use asparagus, 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.119
snap peas, onion or mushrooms instead.

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.536
Now, the vegetables are deliciously browned.

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.607
Place them into the marinade.

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:28.608
Now, with a paper towel, 

00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:31.576
remove the moisture from the salmon.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.176
Then, using a mesh strainer, 

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:40.126
sprinkle all purpose flour on both sides of the fish.

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.926
This will help to create a nicely browned surface 

00:02:43.926 --> 00:02:46.493
and also absorb the marinade.

00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:51.071
Add oil again 

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.774
and reheat the pan.  

00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:58.689
Place the salmon into the pan.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.206
Saute the top side first 

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:04.847
so that you can present a beautifully browned surface.

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:09.119
Occasionally shake the pan to brown evenly.

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:13.480
Cover and saute on low heat.

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:22.794
When the bottom is golden brown, flip it over.

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:25.271
Brown the other side.

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:31.768
You can also grill the salmon to give the skin a crisp texture, 

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:34.150
making the dish more delicious.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.753
Mmmmm. This looks so good!

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:44.744
Now, it is ready.

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:48.437
Place the salmon onto the plate.

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:52.906
Spoon the marinade over the ingredients 

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:55.478
and let them sit until cool.

00:03:56.975 --> 00:04:00.562
Now, the Yakizuke has absorbed the flavor.

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:02.236
Place the kombu seaweed 

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:05.848
and a piece of long green onion onto a plate.

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.522
Then, lean the salmon against them.

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:16.451
Garnish with the bell pepper and the long green onion.

00:04:17.622 --> 00:04:21.253
Finally, spoon the marinade over the salmon.

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:29.225
This is a local dish in Niigata Prefecture 

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:31.357
and it was originally made at home 

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:35.799
to preserve fresh salmon which are caught in that area.

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.981
You can enjoy the dish immediately 

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:50.901
or keep it in the fridge for several hours 

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:54.369
to help it absorb more delicious flavor.

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:55.910
Good luck in the kitchen!
