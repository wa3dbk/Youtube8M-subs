about<00:01:27.000> five<00:01:27.900> minutes<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.220> personally<00:01:29.759> do

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
about five minutes and I personally do

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
about five minutes and I personally do
experience<00:01:30.780> some<00:01:31.290> drop<00:01:31.650> frames<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.369> most<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
experience some drop frames so most of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
experience some drop frames so most of
the<00:01:32.790> time<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.170> click<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the time I will just click out of the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.700 
the time I will just click out of the
game<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.240> come<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
game and then come back in and the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
game and then come back in and the
weather<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:38.970> it'll<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.479> be

normal<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.530> suggest<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> probably<00:01:41.729> if

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
normal so I suggest that probably if

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370

iphone 4 and i'm still getting framerate

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
iphone 4 and i'm still getting framerate
drops<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> lower<00:01:47.340> device<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
drops so if you're on a lower device the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810 
drops so if you're on a lower device the

underground biomes there's new mobs that
drop<00:02:25.560> different<00:02:26.099> materials<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
drop different materials so it's

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.449 
drop different materials so it's
definitely<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.980> cool<00:02:29.519> add<00:02:29.939> on<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> worlds

definitely a cool add on to the worlds

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.059 
definitely a cool add on to the worlds

but moving back on to craft a bulls like

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.710 
but moving back on to craft a bulls like
i'd<00:02:35.220> mentioned<00:02:35.579> before<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.120> tons<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.569> new

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
i'd mentioned before there's tons of new

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.530 
i'd mentioned before there's tons of new
food<00:02:37.019> there's<00:02:37.409> also<00:02:37.620> trinkets<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.540> fireworks

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
food there's also trinkets and fireworks

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140 
food there's also trinkets and fireworks
which<00:02:39.989> fireworks<00:02:40.859> actually<00:02:41.250> confused<00:02:41.700> me<00:02:42.060> at

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
which fireworks actually confused me at

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.500 
which fireworks actually confused me at
first<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.659> can<00:02:42.900> come<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.799> here<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.299> let's<00:02:45.299> see

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
first you can come in here and let's see

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960 
first you can come in here and let's see
where<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.230> where<00:02:46.799> did<00:02:47.129> they<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.459> right<00:02:47.700> here

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
where is it where did they go right here

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.020 
where is it where did they go right here
so<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.829> firework<00:02:50.340> case<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so this is kind of the firework case and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.849 
so this is kind of the firework case and
then<00:02:51.239> once<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.599> make<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.780> case<00:02:52.109> you<00:02:52.319> have<00:02:52.349> to

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
then once you make the case you have to

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.089 
then once you make the case you have to
add<00:02:53.359> dyes<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.389> them<00:02:54.930> before<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.439> can<00:02:55.620> release

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
add dyes to them before you can release

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.860 
add dyes to them before you can release
it<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:56.879> confused<00:02:57.359> me<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it and this actually confused me so you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.379 
it and this actually confused me so you
have<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.290> touch<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.769> hold<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.189> then<00:02:59.819> you<00:03:00.120> can

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
have to touch and hold and then you can

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.259 
have to touch and hold and then you can
add<00:03:00.629> in<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.200> colors<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.519> add<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
add in your colors and you can add up to

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.649 
add in your colors and you can add up to
four<00:03:03.540> colors<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.769> can<00:03:04.920> see<00:03:05.189> there<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.730> you

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
four colors you can see there and you

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.319 
four colors you can see there and you
have<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.109> add<00:03:07.230> at<00:03:07.470> least<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:08.129> die<00:03:08.700> before<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
have to add at least one die before you

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.509 
have to add at least one die before you
can<00:03:09.540> let<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.720> go<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:10.859> shoot<00:03:11.159> it<00:03:11.340> off

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
can let it go and then you shoot it off

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.330 
can let it go and then you shoot it off
and<00:03:11.849> boom<00:03:12.799> fiyah<00:03:13.799> crew<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:15.889> then<00:03:16.889> moving<00:03:17.099> on

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
and boom fiyah crew and then moving on

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
there's new armor and weapons which

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.729 
there's new armor and weapons which
mostly<00:03:19.440> use<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:20.310> new<00:03:20.579> or<00:03:20.849> which<00:03:21.599> is<00:03:21.900> Galvan

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
mostly use this new or which is Galvan

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.509 
mostly use this new or which is Galvan
neum<00:03:23.069> golphin<00:03:23.940> Kelvin<00:03:24.870> neum<00:03:25.349> yep<00:03:25.949> that<00:03:26.250> thing

neum golphin Kelvin neum yep that thing

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.099 
neum golphin Kelvin neum yep that thing
it<00:03:26.669> ends<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.329> numb<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.449> now<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
it ends with a numb and this is now the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.740 
it ends with a numb and this is now the
strongest<00:03:31.949> metal<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.609> these<00:03:32.819> just<00:03:32.849> work<00:03:33.389> kind

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
strongest metal and these just work kind

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
strongest metal and these just work kind
of<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.290> other<00:03:34.590> metals<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.280> get<00:03:35.430> them<00:03:35.639> in

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
of like the other metals you get them in

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.059 
of like the other metals you get them in
the<00:03:35.879> or<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.750> smelt<00:03:37.049> them<00:03:37.169> down<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> ingot

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the or you smelt them down to the ingot

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.369 
the or you smelt them down to the ingot
you<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.430> make<00:03:38.579> them<00:03:38.760> into<00:03:39.000> bars<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.479> then<00:03:40.229> you

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
you can make them into bars and then you

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.080 
you can make them into bars and then you
can<00:03:40.560> make<00:03:40.650> them<00:03:40.859> into<00:03:41.129> chest<00:03:41.370> pieces<00:03:41.669> and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
can make them into chest pieces and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.909 
can make them into chest pieces and
armor<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.720> weapons<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.799> stuff

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
armor and weapons and all that stuff

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.599 
armor and weapons and all that stuff
works<00:03:44.400> just<00:03:44.729> like<00:03:44.970> any<00:03:45.209> other<00:03:45.810> metal<00:03:46.400> also<00:03:47.400> on

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
works just like any other metal also on

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.430 
works just like any other metal also on
armor<00:03:48.030> they<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.389> changed<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:49.049> way<00:03:49.199> in

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
armor they have changed the way in

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.920 
armor they have changed the way in
Unity's<00:03:50.010> work<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.609> before<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.540> could<00:03:51.750> be

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
Unity's work so before you could be

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.649 
Unity's work so before you could be
resistant<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> blast<00:03:52.919> damage<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.819> lava<00:03:54.060> and

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
resistant to blast damage and lava and

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.270 
resistant to blast damage and lava and
ask<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.260> damage<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.919> could<00:03:56.069> breathe

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
ask the damage you could breathe

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.369 
ask the damage you could breathe
underwater<00:03:56.659> there<00:03:57.659> was<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> ton<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.079> different

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
underwater there was a ton of different

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.250 
underwater there was a ton of different
things<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.669> now<00:04:00.060> they<00:04:00.359> have<00:04:00.389> changed<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.079> so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
things but now they have changed it so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.379 
things but now they have changed it so
each<00:04:01.500> one<00:04:01.799> has<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.340> percentage<00:04:02.819> which<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.239> can

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
each one has a percentage which you can

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.990 
each one has a percentage which you can
see<00:04:03.629> at<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.810> bottom<00:04:04.139> here<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.970> example

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
see at the bottom here so for example

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.270 
see at the bottom here so for example
before<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:07.019> could<00:04:07.260> encrust<00:04:07.709> something<00:04:08.129> with

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
before you could encrust something with

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.740 
before you could encrust something with
topaz<00:04:08.669> and<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.000> would<00:04:09.120> automatically<00:04:09.629> be

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
topaz and you would automatically be

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.960 
topaz and you would automatically be
able<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.169> breathe<00:04:10.319> underwater<00:04:10.609> but<00:04:11.609> now<00:04:11.760> when

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
able to breathe underwater but now when

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 
able to breathe underwater but now when
you<00:04:12.060> entrust<00:04:12.419> things<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.169> only<00:04:13.349> get

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
you entrust things you only get

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.120 
you entrust things you only get
twenty-five<00:04:14.220> percent<00:04:14.459> immunity<00:04:15.229> so<00:04:16.229> that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
twenty-five percent immunity so that

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.399 
twenty-five percent immunity so that
adds<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.699> think<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.180> adds<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.570> lot<00:04:18.779> more<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.079> a

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
adds I think that adds a lot more of a

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.080 
adds I think that adds a lot more of a
challenge<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.190> also<00:04:20.340> makes<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.789> so<00:04:20.909> that

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
challenge and it also makes it so that

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.969 
challenge and it also makes it so that
you<00:04:21.180> can't<00:04:21.539> be<00:04:21.779> one<00:04:21.989> hundred<00:04:22.049> percent<00:04:22.320> immune

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
you can't be one hundred percent immune

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.470 
you can't be one hundred percent immune
to<00:04:23.729> every

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
to every

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.770 
to every
single<00:04:25.470> element<00:04:26.370> which<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.790> kind<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.120> nice<00:04:27.300> it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
single element which is kind of nice it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.320 
single element which is kind of nice it
also<00:04:28.410> makes<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.310> can't<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:29.850> one

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
also makes it so that you can't be one

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.060 
also makes it so that you can't be one
hundred<00:04:30.420> percent<00:04:30.660> immune<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.590> every<00:04:31.890> single

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
hundred percent immune to every single

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.480 
hundred percent immune to every single
thing<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.550> think<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.030> most<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.510> I've<00:04:33.630> seen<00:04:33.900> is

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
thing I think the most that I've seen is

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.190 
thing I think the most that I've seen is
one<00:04:35.490> hundred<00:04:35.550> percent<00:04:35.820> immune<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.660> two<00:04:36.930> and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
one hundred percent immune to two and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.160 
one hundred percent immune to two and
then<00:04:37.440> about<00:04:37.710> halfway<00:04:38.160> on<00:04:38.880> another<00:04:39.600> one<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.110> I

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
then about halfway on another one and I

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.680 
then about halfway on another one and I
think<00:04:40.230> that's<00:04:40.590> pretty<00:04:40.860> reasonable<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:42.450> those

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
think that's pretty reasonable so those

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.300 
think that's pretty reasonable so those
are<00:04:42.720> really<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> biggest<00:04:43.500> things<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.190> this

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
are really the biggest things in this

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.730 
are really the biggest things in this
update<00:04:44.520> there<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.150> still<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> couple<00:04:45.780> smaller

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
update there is still a couple smaller

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.550 
update there is still a couple smaller
things<00:04:47.130> their<00:04:47.670> new<00:04:48.060> armor<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.810> weapon<00:04:49.260> sets

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
things their new armor and weapon sets

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.590 
things their new armor and weapon sets
there's<00:04:49.890> also<00:04:50.100> for<00:04:50.520> new<00:04:50.700> statues<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.420> can

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
there's also for new statues you can

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.410 
there's also for new statues you can
collect<00:04:51.780> one<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.800> my<00:04:52.920> favorite<00:04:53.430> things<00:04:54.090> in

this update though is in creative
there's<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.760> stop<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.480> start<00:04:57.810> time<00:04:58.170> button<00:04:58.680> and

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
there's a stop and start time button and

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.910 
there's a stop and start time button and
that<00:04:59.910> will<00:04:59.970> allow<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.960> pretty<00:05:01.140> much<00:05:01.290> do<00:05:01.710> as

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
or I believe if you rename a world it

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.960
