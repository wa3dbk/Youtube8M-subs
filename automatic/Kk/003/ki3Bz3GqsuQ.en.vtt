00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.690
 [Music] 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.240
 and let's see what happened in the sand 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.780
 mexico the highlight of the past 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 Friday the grand finale for the tournament the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
 kings of the air that better exponents 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 that will reach the final that flying 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 Junior and the shadow that follow 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.930
 starring a great rivalry go 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 There, I was looking to take him with him 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.420
 German suplex answered the flyer 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.850
 junior the sea â€‹â€‹cracker that they applied to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.950
 the shadow I was looking for with those scissors 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.369
 then the loop and out of the 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.820
 quadrilateral and where the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.460
 shadow with that the scissors after the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 way to throw yourself with that iron the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.240
 knock down that applied to him he looked for the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 double backflip but placed 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.050
 knees and out of the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 quadrilateral sent to the shadow and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 also the flyer took advantage being 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 the tournament kings of the air had to 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.630
 show this and what better you already said 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.340
 with these two awesome gladiators 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.110
 the performance of these men a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 third fall that left many emotions 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.820
 the first and the second action so 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 very quickly the two were surprised 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.079
 mutually here as the shadow trapped in 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.310
 the air some meetings mercilessly 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.110
 they play against 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.869
 the handrail but these look 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.210
 indestructible these two elements and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.950
 this movement was beginning to give 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 very slight advantage to the shadows that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 the winner was the kick 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 face was looking for the super frankenstein 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.159
 leaving it on the canvas after the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 spanish fly from the flying but it returned 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.670
 with that knee that gave 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.500
 momentarily knocked out he was trying 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 come back with those inverted scissors 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.130
 but the shadow of that one rose 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.409
 moment of the controversy made located and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570
 We argue with the flyer arrives 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.429
 the shadow kick over landa kings 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.959
 and they take off the mask to both 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.060
 first flying in the shade of usually 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.979
 pay with the same currency and package 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
 total at the end the back plans for the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.390
 flying julen so the shadow takes 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.409
 the tournament kings of the air of the arena 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.270
 mexico in its 2013 edition and so the lack 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.990
 of respect the flyer threw the trophy 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.909
 how well the shadow with fang won is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.909
 true but he deserves to be the winner
