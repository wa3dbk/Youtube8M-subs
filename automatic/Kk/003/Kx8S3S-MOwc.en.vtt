review of Planet Hawk number three so I
was<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> little<00:03:04.500> down<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> last<00:03:05.520> issue<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
was a little down on the last issue that

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.120 
was a little down on the last issue that
felt<00:03:06.630> full<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.140> lot<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.320> dialogue<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
felt full of a lot of dialogue that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.100 
felt full of a lot of dialogue that
didn't<00:03:08.400> engage<00:03:08.490> me<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.750> terms<00:03:09.870> of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
didn't engage me and little in terms of

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.410 
didn't engage me and little in terms of
moving<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.470> story<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.920> forward<00:03:11.430> still<00:03:12.300> in

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
moving the story going forward still in

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.760 
moving the story going forward still in
the<00:03:12.510> two<00:03:12.660> weeks<00:03:12.840> since<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.140> review<00:03:13.620> I've

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the two weeks since that review I've

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.200 
the two weeks since that review I've
been<00:03:13.950> thinking<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.490> was<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> little<00:03:14.970> too

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
been thinking that I was a little too

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.930 
been thinking that I was a little too
hard<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.750> Planet<00:03:16.140> Hulk<00:03:16.320> number<00:03:16.740> two<00:03:16.950> some<00:03:17.850> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
hard on Planet Hulk number two some of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.520 
hard on Planet Hulk number two some of
the<00:03:18.000> dialogue<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.630> very<00:03:18.990> important<00:03:19.440> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the dialogue was very important to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.260 
the dialogue was very important to
establishing<00:03:19.980> character<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.940> art<00:03:21.090> was

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
establishing character the art was

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.810 
establishing character the art was
phenomenal<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.170> maybe<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.620> wasn't<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.160> bad

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
phenomenal and maybe it wasn't that bad

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820 
phenomenal and maybe it wasn't that bad
so<00:03:24.390> when<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.600> came<00:03:24.750> time<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.200> read<00:03:25.350> Planet<00:03:25.680> Hulk

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
so when it came time to read Planet Hulk
