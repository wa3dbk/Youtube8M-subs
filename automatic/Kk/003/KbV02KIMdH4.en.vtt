00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
game play it's a little confusing but

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.409 
game play it's a little confusing but
I'm<00:00:26.439> gonna<00:00:26.590> explain<00:00:26.919> it<00:00:27.099> as<00:00:27.189> best<00:00:27.250> I<00:00:27.699> can<00:00:27.759> it<00:00:28.300> is

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
I'm gonna explain it as best I can it is

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.109 
I'm gonna explain it as best I can it is
basically<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:29.110> detachable<00:00:30.009> sentry<00:00:30.939> gun

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
basically a detachable sentry gun

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.930 
basically a detachable sentry gun
vicious<00:00:31.869> metal<00:00:32.200> so<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.070> lot<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.489> it<00:00:33.640> but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
vicious metal so it is a lot to it but

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.610 
vicious metal so it is a lot to it but
carnage<00:00:34.300> isotonic<00:00:34.809> gets<00:00:35.020> something<00:00:35.260> pretty

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
carnage isotonic gets something pretty

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.410 
carnage isotonic gets something pretty
unique<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.579> way<00:00:36.700> this<00:00:36.820> works<00:00:37.059> is<00:00:37.329> that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
unique and the way this works is that

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.889 
unique and the way this works is that
you<00:00:38.020> have<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.370> sentry<00:00:39.370> turret<00:00:39.700> once<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.210> use<00:00:40.690> it

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
you have a sentry turret once you use it

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.209 
you have a sentry turret once you use it
up<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.200> have<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.379> percentage<00:00:41.770> that's<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.160> the

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
up you have a percentage that's in the

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.529 
up you have a percentage that's in the
bottom<00:00:42.460> right<00:00:42.579> corner<00:00:42.610> you<00:00:42.910> can<00:00:43.000> see<00:00:43.059> that<00:00:43.329> and

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
bottom right corner you can see that and

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.900 
bottom right corner you can see that and
it's<00:00:43.900> at<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.050> body<00:00:44.290> %<00:00:44.620> obviously<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.250> once<00:00:45.820> that

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
it's at a body % obviously and once that

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's at a body % obviously and once that
completely<00:00:46.390> goes<00:00:46.690> down<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.620> lose<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.550> sentry

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
completely goes down you lose the sentry

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.010 
completely goes down you lose the sentry
turret<00:00:49.150> as<00:00:49.240> you<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.510> see<00:00:49.690> throughout<00:00:49.900> this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
turret as you can see throughout this

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.380 
turret as you can see throughout this
game<00:00:50.230> play<00:00:50.470> she<00:00:50.829> has<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.250> get<00:00:51.489> another<00:00:51.970> century

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
technically with the sentry turret it's

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.290 
technically with the sentry turret it's
impossible<00:00:56.590> literally<00:00:57.280> impossible<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:58.120> do<00:00:58.270> it

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
impossible literally impossible to do it

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.150 
impossible literally impossible to do it
with<00:00:58.630> one<00:00:58.660> cent<00:00:59.110> return<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.470> get<00:00:59.560> 30<00:00:59.800> kills<00:01:00.040> in

with the to make the vicious in one life

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.209 
with the to make the vicious in one life
using<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.719> century<00:01:14.320> traction<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.829> think<00:01:15.009> it's

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
using the century traction I think it's

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.340 
using the century traction I think it's
like<00:01:15.310> okay<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.940> way<00:01:16.030> works<00:01:16.210> he<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:16.450> like<00:01:16.570> 34

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
like okay so the way works he is like 34

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.710 
like okay so the way works he is like 34

way<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.270> works<00:01:34.450> guys<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.900> was<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.049> little

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
way it works guys and it was a little

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.050 
way it works guys and it was a little
confusing<00:01:35.680> hopefully<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.159> understand<00:01:36.760> what

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
confusing hopefully you understand what

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.000 
confusing hopefully you understand what
I'm<00:01:37.150> trying<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.479> say<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:38.049> don't<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.680> if<00:01:38.860> you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
I'm trying to say I don't know if you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'm trying to say I don't know if you
will<00:01:39.190> or<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.490> but<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.180> idea<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.570> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
will or not but the idea is that a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.010 
will or not but the idea is that a
vicious<00:01:41.740> metal<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.220> 30<00:01:42.580> kills<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.390> get<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
vicious metal is 30 kills so to get the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
vicious metal is 30 kills so to get the
vicious<00:01:44.530> metal<00:01:44.799> he<00:01:44.920> had<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.100> get<00:01:45.189> 30<00:01:45.369> kills<00:01:45.670> in

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
vicious metal he had to get 30 kills in

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
probably repeated myself a lot but I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.570 
probably repeated myself a lot but I
just<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.349> know<00:02:20.440> there'd<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> lot<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.190> comments

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
like what the hell is this but it's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.839 
like what the hell is this but it's
actually<00:02:23.680> still<00:02:23.890> really<00:02:24.190> hard<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.520> do<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
actually still really hard to do I

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:25.650 
actually still really hard to do I
probably<00:02:25.209> couldn't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
probably couldn't

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.450

news<00:02:25.780> honestly<00:02:26.290> because<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.740> turret<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.220> not
