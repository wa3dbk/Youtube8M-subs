this bottom panel is to come out and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680 
this bottom panel is to come out and
flip<00:00:50.080> up<00:00:50.280> you'd<00:00:51.280> have<00:00:51.400> a<00:00:51.460> real<00:00:51.730> bad<00:00:51.970> problem<00:00:52.240> so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
flip up you'd have a real bad problem so

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.100 
flip up you'd have a real bad problem so
you<00:00:52.720> want<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:53.020> make<00:00:53.170> sure<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:54.460> have<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.960> have

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
you want to make sure we have we have

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.780 
you want to make sure we have we have
some<00:00:56.350> storage<00:00:56.650> bins<00:00:56.950> over<00:00:57.250> here<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.610> are<00:00:57.700> in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
some storage bins over here that are in

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.000 
some storage bins over here that are in
the<00:00:57.910> way<00:00:58.060> from<00:00:58.330> stopping<00:00:58.810> that<00:00:58.990> but<00:00:59.290> if<00:00:59.830> you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the way from stopping that but if you

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the way from stopping that but if you
didn't<00:01:00.220> know<00:01:00.250> what<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.520> were<00:01:00.640> doing<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.000> you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
didn't know what you were doing and you

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.180 
didn't know what you were doing and you
pulled<00:01:01.360> on<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.690> door<00:01:01.870> really<00:01:02.110> hard<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:03.010> could

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
pulled on the door really hard it could

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.660 
pulled on the door really hard it could
definitely<00:01:03.370> make<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.150> go<00:01:04.510> away<00:01:04.540> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
definitely make that go away so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.090 
definitely make that go away so
typically<00:01:06.670> when<00:01:06.940> guys<00:01:07.090> are<00:01:07.270> putting<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.720> in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
typically when guys are putting this in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.340 
typically when guys are putting this in
what<00:01:09.100> they'll<00:01:09.340> do<00:01:09.610> is<00:01:09.910> they'll<00:01:10.780> pinch<00:01:11.080> down

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
what they'll do is they'll pinch down

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
what they'll do is they'll pinch down
the<00:01:11.590> bottom<00:01:11.980> that<00:01:12.160> makes<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.490> tough<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.730> pull

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
the bottom that makes it tough to pull

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.940 
the bottom that makes it tough to pull
that<00:01:13.180> rubber<00:01:13.450> out<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:13.990> what<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.230> usually<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.830> is

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
that rubber out so what I usually do is

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670 
that rubber out so what I usually do is
I'll<00:01:15.070> take<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.280> thin<00:01:15.610> screwdriver<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.680> make

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
I'll take a thin screwdriver and make

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'll take a thin screwdriver and make
sure<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:18.220> not<00:01:18.370> pinched<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:18.970> very<00:01:19.300> well

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
sure that it's not pinched up very well

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.250 
sure that it's not pinched up very well
so<00:01:20.040> here's<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.159> screwdriver<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.140> we're<00:01:23.140> just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
so here's the screwdriver and we're just

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.200 
so here's the screwdriver and we're just
going<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.530> take<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:23.830> make<00:01:24.490> sure<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.880> this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
going to take it make sure that this

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.450 
going to take it make sure that this
isn't<00:01:25.480> pinched<00:01:25.960> at<00:01:26.080> all<00:01:26.230> this<00:01:27.010> one's<00:01:27.340> very

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
isn't pinched at all this one's very

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460 
isn't pinched at all this one's very
pinched<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:31.240> they<00:01:31.360> did<00:01:31.600> is<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.780> lot<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.260> times

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
pinched what they did is a lot of times

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
pinched what they did is a lot of times
they'll<00:01:32.680> take<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:34.979> we'll<00:01:35.979> take<00:01:36.010> a<00:01:36.190> pair<00:01:36.460> of

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.210 
they'll take a we'll take a pair of
pliers<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.150> pinch<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.479> tight<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.950> got<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
pliers and pinch it tight so you got to

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.880 
pliers and pinch it tight so you got to
figure<00:01:42.520> out<00:01:42.700> how<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.570> get<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:44.049> pinch<00:01:44.500> out<00:01:44.740> of

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
it was pinched too much and we're going

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.750 
it was pinched too much and we're going
to<00:03:42.470> start<00:03:42.769> taking<00:03:43.040> out<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.519> these<00:03:43.700> bolts

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.100 

usually<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.849> manufacturer<00:03:50.690> use<00:03:50.900> these

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
usually the manufacturer use these

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.259 
usually the manufacturer use these
little<00:03:51.319> ones<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.700> we're<00:03:52.819> going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.090> down

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
little ones so we're going to go down

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:07.930 
little ones so we're going to go down
the<00:03:53.450> whole<00:03:53.629> line<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:53.870> take<00:03:54.200> these<00:03:54.410> apart<00:04:06.940> so

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the whole line and take these apart so

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.150 
the whole line and take these apart so
we<00:04:08.030> got<00:04:08.180> all<00:04:08.329> those<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.019> now<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:10.040> just

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
we got all those out and now you just

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.550 
we got all those out and now you just
take<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.400> screwdriver<00:04:10.959> should<00:04:11.959> pill<00:04:12.230> right<00:04:12.410> out

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
take a screwdriver should pill right out

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.719 
take a screwdriver should pill right out
is<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.739> glued<00:04:16.039> on<00:04:16.250> here

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
is it glued on here

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:41.300 
is it glued on here
it's<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.269> someone<00:04:17.660> epoxy<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.410> on

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:56.300 

once<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.520> get<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:54.330> there<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:55.450> go

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
once I get it there we go

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.010 
once I get it there we go
so<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.520> sides<00:04:57.850> gonna<00:04:58.300> pull<00:04:58.600> right<00:04:58.630> out<00:05:04.020> and

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
so this sides gonna pull right out and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:23.910 
so this sides gonna pull right out and
now<00:05:05.170> this<00:05:05.440> side<00:05:05.740> pulls<00:05:06.130> right<00:05:06.430> out<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.770> then

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
now this side pulls right out and then

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.830 
now this side pulls right out and then
you<00:05:24.070> could<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.430> new<00:05:24.610> one<00:05:27.450> all<00:05:28.450> I'm<00:05:28.690> gonna
