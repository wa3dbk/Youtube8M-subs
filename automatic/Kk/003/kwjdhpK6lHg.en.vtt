to<00:02:35.650> shorten<00:02:35.860> up<00:02:36.010> my<00:02:36.160> swing<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.670> order<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.880> keep

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
to shorten up my swing in order to keep

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.140 
to shorten up my swing in order to keep
the<00:02:37.180> ball<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> power<00:02:38.770> felt<00:02:39.100> good<00:02:39.400> it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the ball in but the power felt good it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.290 
the ball in but the power felt good it
was<00:02:40.330> an<00:02:40.420> overwhelming<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:42.040> my<00:02:42.220> volleys<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300

was an overwhelming on my volleys the
oversized<00:02:43.690> frame<00:02:44.080> just<00:02:44.260> made<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> ball

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
oversized frame just made the ball

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800 
oversized frame just made the ball
weighs<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.010> much<00:02:45.070> easier<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.820> short<00:02:46.330> punch<00:02:46.600> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
weighs so much easier a short punch and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.230 
weighs so much easier a short punch and
on<00:02:46.870> my<00:02:46.990> balls<00:02:47.230> my<00:02:47.380> deep<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> court<00:02:48.250> all

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
on my balls my deep into the court all

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.820 
on my balls my deep into the court all
my<00:02:49.420> serve<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.020> able<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.290> generate<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> lot<00:02:50.800> of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
my serve I was able to generate a lot of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.770 
my serve I was able to generate a lot of
spin<00:02:51.220> which<00:02:51.430> created<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.820> higher<00:02:52.030> bounce<00:02:52.420> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
spin which created a higher bounce I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
spin which created a higher bounce I
kept<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.620> ball<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:53.860> deep<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.520> I'm<00:02:54.820> sure<00:02:55.090> this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
kept the ball in deep and I'm sure this

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
kept the ball in deep and I'm sure this
is<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.690> shot<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.140> would<00:02:56.500> keep<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.890> lot<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.220> your

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
is a shot that would keep a lot of your
