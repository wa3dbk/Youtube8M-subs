mittens<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.709> these<00:03:41.830> youth<00:03:42.100> should<00:03:42.310> have

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
mittens I think these youth should have

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.560 
mittens I think these youth should have
thought<00:03:42.550> ahead<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:43.120> first<00:03:43.300> thing<00:03:43.480> they

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
thought ahead the first thing they

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.300 
thought ahead the first thing they
should<00:03:43.600> have<00:03:43.840> done<00:03:43.870> was<00:03:44.110> stockpile<00:03:44.709> snowballs

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
should have done was stockpile snowballs

should have done was stockpile snowballs
so<00:03:45.580> they<00:03:45.670> wouldn't<00:03:45.820> have<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.060> waste<00:03:46.269> time

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
so they wouldn't have to waste time

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.180 
so they wouldn't have to waste time
creating<00:03:47.080> them<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.380> heat<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> battle<00:03:47.830> then

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
creating them in the heat of battle then

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.110
