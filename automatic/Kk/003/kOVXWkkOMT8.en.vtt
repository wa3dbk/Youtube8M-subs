00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.849 
piece and what you can also do is you
can<00:02:27.519> kind<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.269> just<00:02:28.810> break<00:02:29.019> off<00:02:29.260> corners<00:02:29.709> if

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
can kind of just break off corners if

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.740 
can kind of just break off corners if
you<00:02:29.950> want<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> round<00:02:30.940> them<00:02:31.090> out<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> little<00:02:31.510> bit

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
you want to round them out a little bit

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
you want to round them out a little bit
so<00:02:32.040> they're<00:02:33.040> not<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.400> straight<00:02:35.250> nice<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.489> glue

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
so they're not so straight nice and glue

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.800 
so they're not so straight nice and glue
you<00:02:39.780> place<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:42.060> slightly<00:02:43.060> back<00:02:43.269> further<00:02:43.630> than

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you place it slightly back further than

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.539 
you place it slightly back further than
the<00:02:43.989> first<00:02:44.320> pieces<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.920> lay<00:02:45.070> down<00:02:47.160> yeah<00:02:48.220> looks

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
the first pieces you lay down yeah looks

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.690 
the first pieces you lay down yeah looks
like<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.940> piece<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.359> one<00:02:50.100> fit<00:02:51.100> nicely<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.609> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
like that piece of one fit nicely if I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.759 
like that piece of one fit nicely if I
break<00:02:51.910> off<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.420> right<00:02:52.630> there<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.049> see

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
break off that right there like that see

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.390 
break off that right there like that see
how<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.130> fits<00:02:54.400> nice<00:02:55.950> apply<00:02:56.950> glue<00:02:57.220> right

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
how that fits nice apply glue right

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.110 
how that fits nice apply glue right

like to take the dark colors and apply
them<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.849> places<00:03:37.810> where<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.980> dirt<00:03:39.220> would

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
them to places where the dirt would

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.690 
them to places where the dirt would
settle<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:40.230> real<00:03:41.230> life<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:42.129> on<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.459> flat

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
settle in real life like on the flat

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.509 
settle in real life like on the flat
surfaces<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> cracks<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.430> crevices

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
surfaces and in the cracks and crevices

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.600 
surfaces and in the cracks and crevices
like<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.599> deep<00:03:46.780> parts<00:03:50.489> something<00:03:51.489> like

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
like in the deep parts something like

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.610 
like in the deep parts something like
that<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.910> obviously<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:56.110> know<00:03:56.140> when<00:03:56.500> it's

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
that and obviously you know when it's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.720 
that and obviously you know when it's
wet<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.930> lot<00:03:59.230> darker<00:03:59.560> looking<00:04:00.160> than<00:04:00.430> when

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
wet it is a lot darker looking than when

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.990 
wet it is a lot darker looking than when
it<00:04:00.819> dries<00:04:01.980> what<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.129> does<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.579> gives<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.940> a

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
it dries what this does is it gives it a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.940 
it dries what this does is it gives it a
nice<00:04:04.120> tint<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.049> when<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.140> all<00:04:08.260> dries<00:04:08.560> it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
nice tint so that when it all dries it

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.440 
nice tint so that when it all dries it
looks<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.340> realistic<00:04:09.879> like<00:04:10.000> real<00:04:10.209> rock<00:04:11.160> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
looks more realistic like real rock so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.940 
looks more realistic like real rock so
that's<00:04:13.450> pretty<00:04:13.720> much<00:04:13.840> how<00:04:14.019> fast<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.560> was<00:04:14.680> for

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
that's pretty much how fast it was for

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.199 
that's pretty much how fast it was for
me<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.190> do<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:17.229> step<00:04:17.470> with<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.739> dark<00:04:17.949> color

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
me to do the step with the dark color

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.560 
me to do the step with the dark color
the<00:04:19.209> next<00:04:19.510> step<00:04:19.690> I'll<00:04:19.810> show<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.769> grace

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
the next step I'll show you the grace

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.840 
the next step I'll show you the grace
all<00:04:22.570> right<00:04:22.690> guys<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.289> next<00:04:23.560> step<00:04:23.850> I'm

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
all right guys for the next step I'm

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.930 
all right guys for the next step I'm
using<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.870> grey<00:04:26.860> mix<00:04:27.190> with<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> little<00:04:27.760> bit<00:04:27.850> of

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
using a grey mix with a little bit of

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.750 
using a grey mix with a little bit of
black<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.389> there<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.470> wide<00:04:29.740> type<00:04:30.370> painters

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
black in there and a wide type painters

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.490 
black in there and a wide type painters
brush<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.330> just<00:04:31.510> covers<00:04:31.810> more<00:04:31.990> area<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.320> lot

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
brush it just covers more area a lot

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.580 
brush it just covers more area a lot
faster<00:04:32.979> than<00:04:33.330> using<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.200> little<00:04:35.410> foam

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
faster than using one of the little foam

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.670 
faster than using one of the little foam
brushes<00:04:36.840> we're<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:37.960> really<00:04:38.169> going<00:04:38.349> for

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
brushes we're not really going for

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.370 
brushes we're not really going for
detail<00:04:39.010> here<00:04:39.220> we're<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.400> going<00:04:39.760> for<00:04:40.830> color

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
detail here we're just going for color

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.610 
detail here we're just going for color
just<00:04:44.380> dab<00:04:44.740> on

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
just dab on

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.690
