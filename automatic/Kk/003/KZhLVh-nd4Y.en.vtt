00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
like you're in the flight which is

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.779 
like you're in the flight which is
opposed<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.479> iron<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.070> it's<00:04:38.070> yeah<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.580> very

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
opposed to iron and it's yeah it's very

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.790 
opposed to iron and it's yeah it's very
well<00:04:38.910> designed<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.539> a<00:04:39.599> very<00:04:39.630> nice<00:04:39.900> place<00:04:40.169> spent

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
well designed in a very nice place spent

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.360 
well designed in a very nice place spent
time<00:04:40.979> any<00:04:41.820> downsides<00:04:42.419> well<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:44.160> could

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
time any downsides well it could

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.189 
time any downsides well it could
probably<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.729> bit<00:04:44.910> faster<00:04:45.090> there<00:04:45.750> abouts<00:04:46.020> in

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
probably be a bit faster there abouts in

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.890 
probably be a bit faster there abouts in
a<00:04:46.320> class<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:46.770> will<00:04:46.949> break<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.639> 30-knot<00:04:48.120> area

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
a class that will break the 30-knot area

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.850 
a class that will break the 30-knot area
pretty<00:04:49.229> easily

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
pretty easily

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.379 
pretty easily
and<00:04:50.580> if<00:04:50.669> you're<00:04:50.789> somebody<00:04:50.970> who<00:04:51.150> wants<00:04:51.300> to

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
and if you're somebody who wants to

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.570 
and if you're somebody who wants to
cruise<00:04:51.599> over<00:04:51.780> 30<00:04:52.020> knots<00:04:52.349> then<00:04:52.889> this<00:04:53.250> probably

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
cruise over 30 knots then this probably

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.890 
cruise over 30 knots then this probably
gonna<00:04:53.820> be<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> boat<00:04:54.120> cue<00:04:54.330> because<00:04:54.570> we've<00:04:54.750> got

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
gonna be the boat cue because we've got

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.730 
gonna be the boat cue because we've got
the<00:04:54.990> high

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
the high

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.710 
the high
spec<00:04:56.280> engine<00:04:56.430> here

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
spec engine here

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.660 
spec engine here
even<00:04:57.900> hitting<00:04:58.020> 30<00:04:58.590> personally<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.400> think<00:04:59.520> the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
even hitting 30 personally I think the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.460 
even hitting 30 personally I think the
way<00:04:59.790> this<00:04:59.970> boat<00:05:00.150> works<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:01.050> don't<00:05:01.320> worry

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
way this boat works you don't worry

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.110 
way this boat works you don't worry
about<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.250> will<00:05:02.430> discrete<00:05:02.760> Minnesota

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
about that you will discrete Minnesota

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.880 
about that you will discrete Minnesota
but<00:05:03.330> if<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.540> went<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.720> speed<00:05:04.110> you're<00:05:04.680> probably

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
but if you went to speed you're probably

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.370 
but if you went to speed you're probably
not<00:05:05.400> gonna<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.760> it

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
not gonna like it

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.930 
not gonna like it
other<00:05:07.380> than<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:08.070> there's<00:05:08.370> not<00:05:08.460> much<00:05:08.640> more

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
other than that is there's not much more

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.200 
other than that is there's not much more
to<00:05:09.210> be<00:05:09.450> said<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.980> cruises<00:05:11.310> beautifully

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
to be said it cruises beautifully

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.290 
to be said it cruises beautifully
the<00:05:12.360> interior<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.250> cosseting<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.670> nicely
