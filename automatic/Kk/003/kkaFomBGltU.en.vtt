00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.440
 the staff could have a candle here is 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.790
 reuse by a tutorial and filming 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 here it is difficult to make it easier for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:25.859
 China has a schedule also led to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.820
 a lot of toilet paper in the terminal 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.009
 from busÃ£o 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 I'll send lots of people back later 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.809
 a little roll, right? 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.829
 but the diving in the box is wrong 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 You have to dunk the toilet paper. 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.289
 paraffin 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 You take one of the ends and it pulls you to look only 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.879
 a sheet after the leaf dries fast 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 then dry 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 then you will wind up that he will not stay 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.460
 thought he gets more oxygenated fire is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.460
 better more prolonged right can be 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 different but I like it, I do not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.100
 make a dive of drying you dips 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.820
 in the tip there are people until in 2002 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.939
 that passes the end of the paper between the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 two suitcases so here it pulls 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.329
 the candle itself back where it did not arrive 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 for the fine she runs more and more 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.590
 then let dry on the clothesline piece 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.030
 there are people who do the direct control 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 pulling in the yard 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.700
 There, pick up everything right after 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.060
 Who makes the cookies that separates the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.659
 shaped balloons stack 64 meters 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.789
 You'll separate the balloon. 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.369
 and today has paraffin child does not leave 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:11.349
 yes she is getting you open the paper that is 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.299
 worse that leaves like this is to let him 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.000
 all right after that 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.010
 you make the goal for each size and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 the right balloon model I hope you have 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 liked
