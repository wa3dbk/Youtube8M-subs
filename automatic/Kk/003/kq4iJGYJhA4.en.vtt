too<00:02:33.140> easy<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.860> take<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.400> apart<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.420> was<00:02:35.540> kind

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
too easy to take it apart and I was kind

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.800 
too easy to take it apart and I was kind
of<00:02:35.810> worried<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.470> was<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:38.690> to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
of worried that it was actually going to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.740 
of worried that it was actually going to
come<00:02:39.740> apart<00:02:40.010> really<00:02:40.160> easy<00:02:40.370> once<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.820> was<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.450> my

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
come apart really easy once it was on my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.350 
come apart really easy once it was on my
phone<00:02:41.960> but<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.500> actually<00:02:42.710> doesn't<00:02:43.210> see<00:02:44.210> this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
phone but it actually doesn't see this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.750 
phone but it actually doesn't see this
one's<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.690> my<00:02:44.810> phone<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.350> it's<00:02:45.500> not<00:02:46.340> really

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
one's on my phone and it's not really

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.000 
one's on my phone and it's not really
easy<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.150> pull<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.870> apart<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.740> you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
easy to pull it apart I think you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.190 
easy to pull it apart I think you
actually<00:02:49.220> there's<00:02:49.700> like<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.030> little<00:02:50.450> slit

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
actually there's like a little slit

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.440 
actually there's like a little slit
right<00:02:51.580> here<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.610> don't<00:02:52.820> know<00:02:52.910> if<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.240> see

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
right here I don't know if you can see

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.810 
right here I don't know if you can see
that<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.290> actually<00:02:54.860> use<00:02:55.190> something<00:02:55.460> to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
that but you actually use something to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.740 
that but you actually use something to
prop<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.500> apart<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.000> once<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.330> there<00:02:59.480> it's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
prop it apart so once it's on there it's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.450 
prop it apart so once it's on there it's
really<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.740> that's<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.130> good<00:03:01.160> thing

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
really on there so that's a good thing

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.130 
really on there so that's a good thing
because<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.910> don't<00:03:01.940> want<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.570> cell<00:03:02.840> phone<00:03:02.960> case

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
because you don't want a cell phone case

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.200 
because you don't want a cell phone case
to<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:03.530> kind<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:03.800> fall<00:03:03.980> off<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.370> they<00:03:05.090> don't

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
to just kind of fall off and they don't

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.620 
to just kind of fall off and they don't
only<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.570> like<00:03:06.050> rhinestone<00:03:07.630> blinged-out

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
only have like rhinestone blinged-out

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.230 
only have like rhinestone blinged-out
cases<00:03:09.350> they<00:03:09.890> also<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.460> like<00:03:10.730> rubberized

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
cases they also have like rubberized

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.590 
cases they also have like rubberized
ones<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.820> have<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.120> all<00:03:14.240> kinds<00:03:14.420> of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
ones and they have the all kinds of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.790 
ones and they have the all kinds of
different<00:03:14.870> ones<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.380> guys<00:03:15.620> should<00:03:15.770> check

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
different ones so you guys should check

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.220 
different ones so you guys should check
out<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> website<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:17.210> am<00:03:17.720> very<00:03:17.900> happy<00:03:18.050> with

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
out the website I am very happy with

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.640 
out the website I am very happy with
them<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.860> think<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.220> prices<00:03:19.670> were<00:03:20.650> really

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
them and I think the prices were really

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.440 
them and I think the prices were really
reasonable<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.370> mean<00:03:22.520> some<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.910> cases<00:03:23.240> were

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
reasonable I mean some of the cases were

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.090 
reasonable I mean some of the cases were
pretty<00:03:23.870> expensive<00:03:24.170> like<00:03:24.680> some<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
pretty expensive like some of the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.920 
pretty expensive like some of the
blinged<00:03:25.370> out<00:03:25.520> ones<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.360> think<00:03:26.630> they<00:03:26.750> had

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
blinged out ones but I think they had

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.810 
blinged out ones but I think they had
sawasdee<00:03:27.500> crystal<00:03:27.860> or<00:03:28.010> something<00:03:28.310> on<00:03:28.430> them<00:03:28.640> so

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
sawasdee crystal or something on them so

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.040 
sawasdee crystal or something on them so
that's<00:03:29.000> why<00:03:29.150> they<00:03:29.300> were<00:03:29.330> more<00:03:29.630> they<00:03:29.810> were<00:03:29.870> like

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
that's why they were more they were like

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.590 
that's why they were more they were like
50<00:03:30.380> bucks<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.710> for<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.370> majority<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
50 bucks but for the majority of the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.970 
50 bucks but for the majority of the
cell<00:03:32.780> phone<00:03:32.930> cases<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:33.530> had<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:33.800> there

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
cell phone cases that they had on there

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.890 
cell phone cases that they had on there
for<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.250> iPhone<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.820> saw<00:03:35.180> they<00:03:35.810> were

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
for the iPhone that I saw they were

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.350 
for the iPhone that I saw they were
really<00:03:36.170> reasonably<00:03:37.100> priced<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:38.150> for

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
really reasonably priced I think for

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.330 
really reasonably priced I think for
instance<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.870> one<00:03:39.140> was<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:39.650> fourteen

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
instance this one was like fourteen

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.210 
instance this one was like fourteen
fifteen<00:03:41.180> dollars<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:42.620> think<00:03:42.860> that's<00:03:43.130> a

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
fifteen dollars so I think that's a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.590 
fifteen dollars so I think that's a
really<00:03:43.400> good<00:03:43.520> price<00:03:43.640> for<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:44.000> cell<00:03:44.180> phone<00:03:44.360> case

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
really good price for a cell phone case

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.460 
really good price for a cell phone case
that's<00:03:45.050> all<00:03:45.320> blinged<00:03:45.620> out<00:03:45.770> like<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.910> I

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
that's all blinged out like this so I

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.960 
that's all blinged out like this so I
will<00:03:48.470> put<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.920> links<00:03:49.190> down<00:03:49.340> below<00:03:49.370> for<00:03:49.820> these

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970
