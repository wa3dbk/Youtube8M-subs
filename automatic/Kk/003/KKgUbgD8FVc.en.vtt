00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
all 12 layers and you're going to go to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.960 
all 12 layers and you're going to go to
layer<00:00:24.120> 12<00:00:25.010> well<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.520> you're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.850> to<00:00:26.910> have

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
layer 12 well then you're going to have

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.770 
layer 12 well then you're going to have
to<00:00:27.120> choose<00:00:27.270> circle<00:00:28.610> go<00:00:29.610> to<00:00:29.670> circle<00:00:30.120> and<00:00:30.270> change

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
to choose circle go to circle and change

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.530 
to choose circle go to circle and change
it<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.050> white<00:00:31.700> don't<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.940> move<00:00:33.150> anywhere

it to white don't like move anywhere
just<00:00:33.690> keep<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:33.990> dead<00:00:34.200> center<00:00:34.530> where<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> started

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
just keep a dead center where it started

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.950 
just keep a dead center where it started
at<00:00:35.360> okay<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:37.050> duplicate<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> layer<00:00:38.190> or

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
at okay then duplicate the layer or

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.940 
at okay then duplicate the layer or
duplicate<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> layer<00:00:40.080> by<00:00:40.260> pressing<00:00:40.290> X<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
duplicate the layer by pressing X and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.390 
duplicate the layer by pressing X and
change<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> black<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.930> press<00:00:43.200> R<00:00:43.410> b2<00:00:44.190> and

change it to black then press R b2 and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.420 
change it to black then press R b2 and
make<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.730> outline<00:00:45.739> then<00:00:46.739> go<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> layer<00:00:47.160> 10

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
make it an outline then go to layer 10

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
make it an outline then go to layer 10
and<00:00:48.020> you're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> find<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and you're going to have to find the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
and you're going to have to find the
curved<00:00:50.100> piece<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> can't<00:00:50.850> remember<00:00:50.970> actually

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
curved piece I can't remember actually

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.229 
curved piece I can't remember actually
just<00:00:51.629> find<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> name<00:00:52.230> you'll<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.239> think

just find the name you'll see it I think
it's<00:00:54.330> like<00:00:54.570> page<00:00:54.809> eight<00:00:55.140> ish<00:00:55.370> seven<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.839> 65

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
it's like page eight ish seven maybe 65

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's like page eight ish seven maybe 65
I<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.739> remember<00:00:58.860> somewhere<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.699> nothing<00:01:00.120> is

circle and put in the center of the
curved<00:01:33.340> line

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
curved line

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.020 
curved line
right<00:01:36.560> there<00:01:36.799> not<00:01:37.039> too<00:01:37.249> big<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.759> don't<00:01:37.909> want

right there not too big you don't want
make<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.240> two<00:01:38.359> times<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:39.590> wouldn't<00:01:39.859> look

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
make it two times that wouldn't look

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.069 
make it two times that wouldn't look
very<00:01:40.009> good<00:01:40.219> either<00:01:40.369> right<00:01:40.819> there's<00:01:41.060> good<00:01:41.119> then

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
very good either right there's good then

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.679 
very good either right there's good then
you're<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.469> to<00:01:42.530> duplicate<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> circle<00:01:43.689> and

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you're going to duplicate the circle and

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.450 
you're going to duplicate the circle and
then<00:01:45.590> you're<00:01:45.799> going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.979> make<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.189> white

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
then you're going to make it a white

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.220 
then you're going to make it a white
circle<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.719> make<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> little<00:01:48.109> bit<00:01:48.289> smaller

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.120 

okay<00:01:52.710> right<00:01:52.890> there

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.459 

and<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:58.820> you're<00:01:59.149> going<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.329> duplicate<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
and then you're going to duplicate the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.580 
and then you're going to duplicate the
circle<00:02:00.740> again<00:02:01.090> make<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.210> black<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.750> press<00:02:03.289> RB

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
circle again make it black and press RB

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.109 
circle again make it black and press RB
to<00:02:03.710> make<00:02:03.829> another<00:02:04.100> outline<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.880> make<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
to make another outline and make it a

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.650 
to make another outline and make it a
little<00:02:05.299> bit<00:02:05.539> smaller<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:06.860> take<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.070> inside

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
little bit smaller just take the inside

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.180 
little bit smaller just take the inside
just<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.210

you're going to duplicate it pressing X

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.189 
you're going to duplicate it pressing X
we<00:03:32.069> didn't<00:03:32.219> know<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.430> yet<00:03:32.900> okay<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.139> you're

then<00:03:56.920> I'm<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> duplicate<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.640> again<00:03:57.940> one

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
then I'm going to duplicate it again one

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.840 
then I'm going to duplicate it again one
last<00:03:58.450> time<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.230> then<00:03:59.290> fill<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.800> really<00:04:00.460> little

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
last time and then fill up really little

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.740 
last time and then fill up really little
bit<00:04:00.970> left<00:04:01.210> now<00:04:02.080> its<00:04:02.260> entire<00:04:02.320> red<00:04:02.950> top<00:04:03.480> go<00:04:04.480> up<00:04:04.600> to

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
bit left now its entire red top go up to

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.040 
bit left now its entire red top go up to
layer<00:04:04.900> three<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:06.660> you're<00:04:07.660> going<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.840> need<00:04:07.960> to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
layer three and you're going to need to

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.450 
layer three and you're going to need to
have<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> middle<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.800> what<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.040> believe<00:04:09.280> it's

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
have a middle of what I believe it's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.880 
have a middle of what I believe it's
called<00:04:09.520> or<00:04:09.970> oval<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.260> don't<00:04:11.470> actually<00:04:11.590> know

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
called or oval I don't actually know

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.180 
called or oval I don't actually know
oval<00:04:12.340> medium<00:04:12.640> there<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.120> right<00:04:13.240> there

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
oval medium there you go right there

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.300 
oval medium there you go right there
then<00:04:15.190> change<00:04:15.460> that's<00:04:15.640> white

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.789 

and<00:04:19.430> then<00:04:20.150> there<00:04:20.690> you're<00:04:21.290> going<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.470> put<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.709> up
