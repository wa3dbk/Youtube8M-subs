00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
they tested these new safety features it

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.770 
they tested these new safety features it
didn't<00:04:15.350> fail<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.860> this<00:04:16.130> yeah<00:04:16.940> remember<00:04:17.630> when

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
didn't fail like this yeah remember when

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.000 
didn't fail like this yeah remember when
volvo<00:04:18.109> was<00:04:18.230> doing<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.530> test<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.859> their

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
volvo was doing a test of their

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
collision detection system and it failed

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.810 
collision detection system and it failed
to<00:04:20.989> detect<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.560> collision<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.220> crash<00:04:22.610> right

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820

anyway<00:04:25.400> two<00:04:25.910> new<00:04:26.120> safety<00:04:26.420> technologies<00:04:27.110> will

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
anyway two new safety technologies will

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.190 
anyway two new safety technologies will
debut<00:04:27.440> at<00:04:27.830> Geneva<00:04:28.220> including<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.180> active<00:04:29.930> high

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
debut at Geneva including a active high

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.860 
debut at Geneva including a active high
beam<00:04:30.500> control<00:04:30.830> system<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:32.480> world's

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
beam control system and the world's

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.960 
beam control system and the world's
first<00:04:33.020> collision<00:04:33.530> avoiding<00:04:34.190> technology

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
first collision avoiding technology

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.210 
first collision avoiding technology
we've<00:04:35.720> heard<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.050> active<00:04:36.410> high<00:04:36.560> beams<00:04:36.800> before

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
we've heard of active high beams before

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.950 
we've heard of active high beams before
which<00:04:37.400> they<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.210> switched<00:04:38.390> between<00:04:38.540> low<00:04:38.930> and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
which they just switched between low and

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.720 
which they just switched between low and
high<00:04:39.200> beams<00:04:39.560> when<00:04:39.770> another<00:04:39.950> car<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.310> detected

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
high beams when another car is detected

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.400 
high beams when another car is detected
which<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.240> cool<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.540> all<00:04:41.660> but<00:04:41.720> no<00:04:42.080> big<00:04:42.260> deal

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
which is cool and all but no big deal

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.380 
which is cool and all but no big deal
volvo<00:04:43.370> decided<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.850> take<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> step

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
volvo decided to take that a step

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.320 
volvo decided to take that a step
further<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:45.169> will<00:04:45.680> now<00:04:45.830> only<00:04:46.100> direct<00:04:47.030> high

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
further and will now only direct high

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.260 
further and will now only direct high
beams<00:04:47.630> at<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.440> road<00:04:48.710> around<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.910> oncoming

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
beams at the road around the oncoming

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.470 
beams at the road around the oncoming
car<00:04:50.540> not<00:04:50.840> switching<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.950> low<00:04:52.100> beams<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:53.150> is

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
car not switching to low beams that is

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.630 
car not switching to low beams that is
pretty<00:04:53.750> awesome<00:04:53.930> my<00:04:54.440> friends<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:54.979> we'll<00:04:55.520> have

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
pretty awesome my friends and we'll have

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.219 
pretty awesome my friends and we'll have
to<00:04:55.760> wait<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:55.940> see<00:04:56.120> exactly<00:04:56.270> how<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:56.990> new

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
to wait and see exactly how this new

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.320 
to wait and see exactly how this new
system<00:04:57.440> will<00:04:57.620> work<00:04:57.740> but<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.669> name<00:04:58.820> sort<00:04:59.150> of

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
system will work but the name sort of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.760 
system will work but the name sort of
sounds<00:04:59.509> like<00:04:59.599> a<00:04:59.659> revolutionary<00:05:00.349> collision

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
sounds like a revolutionary collision

no clue how they're going to stop the
light<00:05:07.189> from<00:05:07.370> shining<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:08.120> mean<00:05:08.689> if<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.169> look<00:05:09.289> at

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379

light from shining I mean if you look at
these<00:05:09.439> pictures<00:05:09.500> how<00:05:10.219> do<00:05:10.280> they<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:10.550> make<00:05:10.699> the

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
these pictures how do they just make the

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.020 
these pictures how do they just make the
