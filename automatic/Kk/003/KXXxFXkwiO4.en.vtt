00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
this domination on freight where the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
this domination on freight where the
game<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.500> already<00:00:58.710> 50<00:00:59.250> points<00:00:59.489> through<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
game was already 50 points through and I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
game was already 50 points through and I
went<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> 3-gun<00:01:00.719> streak<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.289> I'd<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.770> twice

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
went a 3-gun streak and I'd like twice

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
went a 3-gun streak and I'd like twice
so<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> cut<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> start<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.239> that's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so I cut that at the start and that's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.060 
so I cut that at the start and that's
what<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.049> seeing<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.500> essentially<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
what you're seeing is essentially the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
what you're seeing is essentially the
start<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.489> about<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> 50

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
start of about a 50

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.539 
start of about a 50
kill<00:01:06.869> streak<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.680> nearly<00:01:07.860> fifty<00:01:08.280> kills

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
kill streak and when nearly fifty kills

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
kill streak and when nearly fifty kills
without<00:01:08.820> dying<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.780> about<00:01:09.869> fifty

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
without dying I think I'm on about fifty

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
without dying I think I'm on about fifty
fifteen<00:01:11.159> gun<00:01:11.610> streak<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> wait<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fifteen gun streak and if you wait to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
fifteen gun streak and if you wait to
the<00:01:13.500> end<00:01:13.619> you'll<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.100> mouse<00:01:14.250> kills<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.820> get

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the end you'll see the mouse kills I get

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
the end you'll see the mouse kills I get
in<00:01:15.119> total<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> score<00:01:16.140> line<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.280> get

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
in total and the score line and I do get

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.740 
in total and the score line and I do get
quite<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.090> kills<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> short<00:01:18.689> amount

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
quite a lot of kills in a short amount

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.749 
quite a lot of kills in a short amount
of<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.710> lucky<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.250> some

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of time so I was pretty lucky in some

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
of time so I was pretty lucky in some
situations<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.380> nice

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
situations and it's just a really nice

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
situations and it's just a really nice
gameplay<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.130> enjoy<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> background

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
gameplay so enjoy that in the background

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
gameplay so enjoy that in the background
but<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.350> literally<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:26.130> game

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
but so this was literally my first game

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
but so this was literally my first game
on<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.939> hands<00:01:27.150> were<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.630> cold<00:01:27.930> I'm

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on so my hands were like very cold I'm

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.719

aim<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> pretty<00:01:28.979> bad<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.310> might<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
aim is pretty bad you might see that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370 
aim is pretty bad you might see that
sometimes<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> plan<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.630> run<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> ammo

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
sometimes this plan just run out of ammo

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
sometimes this plan just run out of ammo
and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.040> had<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.490> try<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> knife<00:01:32.880> someone

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and I had to go and try a knife someone

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
and I had to go and try a knife someone
in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> back<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> gun<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> worked

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in the back and get that gun that worked

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.870 
in the back and get that gun that worked
out<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.009> well<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.579> thought<00:01:35.729> he

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
out really well because I thought he

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
out really well because I thought he
actually<00:01:36.150> saw<00:01:36.360> me<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.990> set<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> order<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
actually saw me but set in order to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.469 
actually saw me but set in order to
carry<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.250> air<00:01:38.430> kill<00:01:38.670> streak<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.329> my

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
carry my air kill streak and get my

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.510 
carry my air kill streak and get my
streaks<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> had<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> pick<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> gun<00:01:40.979> even

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
streaks in I had to pick up a gun even

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.770 
streaks in I had to pick up a gun even
though<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> had<00:01:41.729> scavenger<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.390> wasn't<00:01:42.689> actually

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
though I had scavenger I wasn't actually

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
though I had scavenger I wasn't actually
running<00:01:43.049> over<00:01:43.229> any<00:01:43.439> scab<00:01:43.680> packs<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
running over any scab packs but I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
running over any scab packs but I
managed<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.180> streaks<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
managed to get my streaks here and this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
managed to get my streaks here and this
is<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.890> much<00:01:46.979> where<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> kill

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is pretty much where all the kill

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.609 
is pretty much where all the kill
streaks<00:01:48.180> start<00:01:48.509> coming<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> starts<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> get

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
streaks start coming in it starts to get

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
streaks start coming in it starts to get
really<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.220> action-packed<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
really really action-packed and so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.960 
really really action-packed and so
you'll<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.560> sometimes<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you'll see is sometimes I'm actually is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.340 
you'll see is sometimes I'm actually is
a<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.329> off<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.600> I'd<00:01:54.810> say<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> my

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a little bit off because I'd say is my

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.130 
a little bit off because I'd say is my
first<00:01:55.649> game<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> twitching<00:01:57.899> all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
first game on and I'm like twitching all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.749 
first game on and I'm like twitching all
over<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> place<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> I've<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.310> actual

ghosts it's always something i like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
ghosts it's always something i like
working<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.750> say<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.380> full

working for but say you can see my full
setup<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.459> here's<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:08.879> screen

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
setup right here here's a little screen

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.260 
setup right here here's a little screen
shot<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> perks

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.030 
shot and there you can see all the perks
attachments<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.050> killstreaks<00:02:12.320> this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
attachments and killstreaks this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.610 
attachments and killstreaks this
probably<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.790> best<00:02:14.060> assault<00:02:14.720> streak<00:02:15.200> set<00:02:15.470> up

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
probably the best assault streak set up

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.620 
probably the best assault streak set up
I'd<00:02:15.800> recommend<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.610> need<00:02:16.790> seven<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
I'd recommend you need seven for the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.170 
I'd recommend you need seven for the
tree<00:02:17.840> rocket<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:19.040> domination<00:02:19.490> if<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.940> cap

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
tree rocket but in domination if you cap

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.760 
tree rocket but in domination if you cap
your<00:02:20.360> own<00:02:20.450> spawn<00:02:20.690> flag<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> if<00:02:21.650> you're

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
your own spawn flag and if you're

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.350 
your own spawn flag and if you're
running<00:02:21.860> hardline<00:02:22.460> like<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.210> don't

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
running hardline like I and you don't

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.150 
running hardline like I and you don't
need<00:02:23.480> five<00:02:23.780> kills<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:25.070> that's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
need five kills for it and then that's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.770 
need five kills for it and then that's
pretty<00:02:25.280> easy<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.880> Trinity<00:02:26.210> rocket<00:02:26.510> arena

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
pretty easy for a Trinity rocket arena

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.260 
pretty easy for a Trinity rocket arena
rocket<00:02:27.020> itself<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.620> find<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.670> bad<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
rocket itself I find is really bad and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.270 
rocket itself I find is really bad and
most<00:02:29.750> maps<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.260> ghosts<00:02:30.470> tend<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:30.950> stall

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
most maps in ghosts tend to have stall

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920 
most maps in ghosts tend to have stall
structures<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.090> least<00:02:32.240> half<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.660> map<00:02:32.810> is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
structures or at least half the map is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.540 
structures or at least half the map is
covering<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.350> building<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.220> other<00:02:34.310> half

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
covering the building and the other half

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.250 
covering the building and the other half
is<00:02:34.700> kind<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.910> outdoors<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.930> perfect

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
is kind of outdoors this is a perfect

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.630 
is kind of outdoors this is a perfect
example<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.800> there's<00:02:37.010> lots<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.400> tall

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
example of it there's lots of tall

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.610 
example of it there's lots of tall
structures<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.630> kind<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.900> cranes<00:02:39.230> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
structures and kind of cranes and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.320 
structures and kind of cranes and
shipping<00:02:40.160> things<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:40.640> around<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.060> map<00:02:41.210> so

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
shipping things all around the map so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.180 
shipping things all around the map so
you<00:02:41.390> can't<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:41.900> call<00:02:42.350> them<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.650> very<00:02:42.920> well

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
you can't really call them in very well

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.400 
you can't really call them in very well
and<00:02:43.430> things<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> tree<00:02:44.540> rocket<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.050> that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
and things like the tree rocket is that

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
and things like the tree rocket is that
when<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.620> comes<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.100> actually<00:02:46.430> comes<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:46.790> at

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
when it comes in it actually comes in at

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.940 
when it comes in it actually comes in at
a<00:02:46.940> drift<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.450> comes<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.840> an<00:02:47.930> angle<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.770> it's

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
a drift it comes in at an angle so it's

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.710 
a drift it comes in at an angle so it's
very<00:02:49.130> difficult<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.730> actually<00:02:49.850> aim<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.480> thing

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
very difficult to actually aim the thing

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.150 
very difficult to actually aim the thing
and<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.960> tends<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.350> go<00:02:51.770> where<00:02:52.040> you're

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and it tends to not go where you're

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
and it tends to not go where you're
trying<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.490> aim<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.060> land<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.020> after

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
trying to aim it to land and then after

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.960 
trying to aim it to land and then after
that<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.070> other<00:02:55.190> two<00:02:55.490> kills<00:02:55.730> full

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
that you need and other two kills full

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
something like that but it's very

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.159 
something like that but it's very
difficult<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.390> ghosts<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.720> actually<00:04:17.959> shoot

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
difficult in ghosts to actually shoot

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.539 
difficult in ghosts to actually shoot
stuff<00:04:18.380> down<00:04:18.650> which<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.950> why<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.190> assault

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
stuff down which is why the assault

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.400 
stuff down which is why the assault
streaks<00:04:19.850> they're<00:04:20.210> kind<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.600> difficult<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:21.169> get

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
streaks they're kind of difficult to get

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.960 
streaks they're kind of difficult to get
but<00:04:21.590> when<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:22.070> get<00:04:22.280> them<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.640> if<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:22.880> a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
but when you do get them and if it's a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.820 
but when you do get them and if it's a
perfect<00:04:23.419> situation<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:24.260> guess<00:04:24.320> if<00:04:24.590> you're

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
perfect situation I guess if you're

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.890 
perfect situation I guess if you're
really<00:04:25.069> open<00:04:25.400> map<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:26.030> Stonehaven<00:04:26.750> for

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
really open map like Stonehaven for

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
really open map like Stonehaven for
example<00:04:27.319> which<00:04:27.439> is<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> bad<00:04:27.800> map<00:04:28.069> in<00:04:28.220> general

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
example which is a bad map in general

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.339 
example which is a bad map in general
but<00:04:29.000> they're<00:04:29.240> very<00:04:29.419> very<00:04:29.689> good<00:04:29.870> for<00:04:30.050> streets

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
but they're very very good for streets

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.110 
but they're very very good for streets
if<00:04:30.919> you're<00:04:31.099> in<00:04:31.189> map<00:04:31.340> like<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.970> would

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
if you're in map like that you would

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.879 
if you're in map like that you would
really<00:04:32.569> really<00:04:32.930> do<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.139> lot<00:04:33.349> of<00:04:33.379> work<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
really really do a lot of work and

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.980 
really really do a lot of work and
especially<00:04:34.129> in<00:04:34.400> ground<00:04:34.699> war<00:04:35.000> you'd<00:04:35.629> get<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> lot

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
especially in ground war you'd get a lot

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.029 
especially in ground war you'd get a lot
kills<00:04:36.259> and<00:04:36.439> right<00:04:36.560> here<00:04:36.710> I'm<00:04:36.800> kind<00:04:36.979> of

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
kills and right here I'm kind of

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.040 
kills and right here I'm kind of
speeding<00:04:37.370> up<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> gameplay<00:04:37.939> because<00:04:38.389> I'm

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
speeding up the gameplay because I'm

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.480 
speeding up the gameplay because I'm
literally<00:04:39.349> just<00:04:39.409> laying<00:04:39.800> around<00:04:39.949> my<00:04:40.250> chopper

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
literally just laying around my chopper

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.980 
literally just laying around my chopper
as<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.819> said<00:04:41.060> there's<00:04:41.419> not<00:04:41.599> really<00:04:41.719> much<00:04:41.930> point

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
as I said there's not really much point

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.659 
as I said there's not really much point
going<00:04:42.379> out<00:04:42.590> inside<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.189> getting<00:04:43.430> killed

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
going out inside and getting killed

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.890 
going out inside and getting killed
anything<00:04:43.969> could<00:04:44.210> happen<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.509> I'm<00:04:44.569> gonna<00:04:44.750> spawn

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
anything could happen so I'm gonna spawn

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.119 
anything could happen so I'm gonna spawn
behind<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.319> so<00:04:45.469> literally<00:04:45.800> waiting<00:04:46.069> around

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
behind you so literally waiting around

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.890 
behind you so literally waiting around
wasn't<00:04:46.460> exactly<00:04:46.610> camping<00:04:47.180> like<00:04:47.360> waiting<00:04:47.870> for

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
wasn't exactly camping like waiting for

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.570 
wasn't exactly camping like waiting for
someone<00:04:48.439> to<00:04:48.530> walk<00:04:48.620> through<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.860> door<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:49.280> was

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
building just waiting for my helicopter

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.490

and<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:34.279> don't<00:05:34.340> really<00:05:34.550> think<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.879> could<00:05:35.060> get<00:05:35.270> it

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
and I don't really think I could get it

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.909 
and I don't really think I could get it
but<00:05:35.629> then<00:05:35.779> I<00:05:35.900> realized<00:05:36.289> it<00:05:36.409> was<00:05:36.440> kind<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.680> in<00:05:36.830> my

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
but then I realized it was kind of in my

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.589 
but then I realized it was kind of in my
range<00:05:37.159> and<00:05:37.279> actually<00:05:37.580> shot<00:05:37.729> that<00:05:38.000> down<00:05:38.240> as

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
range and actually shot that down as

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.269 
range and actually shot that down as
well<00:05:38.629> so<00:05:39.080> I<00:05:39.110> was<00:05:39.199> doing<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.529> lot<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.740> work<00:05:40.009> right

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
well so I was doing a lot of work right

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.129 
well so I was doing a lot of work right
here<00:05:40.520> actually<00:05:40.909> taken<00:05:41.509> down<00:05:41.659> a<00:05:41.870> other

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
here actually taken down a other

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.230 
here actually taken down a other
killstreaks<00:05:42.860> as<00:05:43.069> well<00:05:43.279> and<00:05:43.639> this<00:05:43.789> was<00:05:43.940> just<00:05:43.969> so

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
killstreaks as well and this was just so

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.149 
killstreaks as well and this was just so
much<00:05:44.389> fun<00:05:44.449> in<00:05:44.870> general<00:05:45.289> has<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:45.680> much<00:05:45.860> fun<00:05:46.039> in

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
much fun in general has so much fun in

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.379 
much fun in general has so much fun in
this<00:05:46.310> game<00:05:46.400> probably<00:05:46.849> one<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:46.969> those<00:05:47.120> fun

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
this game probably one of those fun

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.149 
this game probably one of those fun
games<00:05:47.629> I've<00:05:47.839> ever<00:05:48.020> had<00:05:48.229> in<00:05:48.379> ghosts<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.770> it

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
games I've ever had in ghosts and it

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.070 
games I've ever had in ghosts and it
just<00:05:49.339> so<00:05:49.430> happened<00:05:49.789> to<00:05:49.909> be<00:05:50.029> my<00:05:50.180> first<00:05:50.479> game<00:05:50.779> on

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
just so happened to be my first game on

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.480 
just so happened to be my first game on
and<00:05:51.379> I'm<00:05:51.529> really<00:05:51.740> lucky<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.039> I<00:05:52.159> got<00:05:52.370> this

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
and I'm really lucky that I got this

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.369 
and I'm really lucky that I got this
gameplay<00:05:53.000> I<00:05:53.029> guess<00:05:53.330> because<00:05:53.539> people<00:05:54.110> happen

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
gameplay I guess because people happen

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.409 
gameplay I guess because people happen
to<00:05:54.409> be<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.710> right<00:05:54.860> positions<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.639> just

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
to be in the right positions and just

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.659 
to be in the right positions and just
then<00:05:56.569> I<00:05:56.659> got<00:05:56.810> knifed<00:05:57.199> to<00:05:57.529> end<00:05:58.039> the<00:05:58.250> gun<00:05:58.430> Street

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
then I got knifed to end the gun Street

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.309 
then I got knifed to end the gun Street
was<00:05:58.789> kind<00:05:59.000> of<00:05:59.029> a<00:05:59.120> fortunate<00:05:59.599> I<00:05:59.750> guess<00:06:00.020> I<00:06:00.139> might

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
was kind of a fortunate I guess I might

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.869 
was kind of a fortunate I guess I might
have<00:06:00.409> been<00:06:00.500> on<00:06:00.620> set<00:06:00.979> for<00:06:01.219> an<00:06:01.370> assault<00:06:01.610> Kem

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
have been on set for an assault Kem

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.300 
have been on set for an assault Kem
strike<00:06:02.000> but<00:06:02.479> this<00:06:02.839> guy<00:06:03.020> just<00:06:03.560> panic<00:06:03.889> knife<00:06:04.039> me

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
strike but this guy just panic knife me

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.800 
strike but this guy just panic knife me
out<00:06:04.460> of<00:06:04.610> nowhere<00:06:04.819> and<00:06:05.210> that's<00:06:05.360> one<00:06:05.599> thing

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
out of nowhere and that's one thing

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.659 
out of nowhere and that's one thing
that's<00:06:06.020> important<00:06:06.379> to<00:06:06.409> note<00:06:06.500> that<00:06:06.860> a<00:06:07.129> knifing

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
that's important to note that a knifing

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.399 
that's important to note that a knifing
is<00:06:07.849> still<00:06:08.150> a<00:06:08.360> one-hit<00:06:08.779> kill<00:06:08.990> even<00:06:09.319> though

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
is still a one-hit kill even though

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.709 
is still a one-hit kill even though
there's<00:06:09.620> increased<00:06:10.069> health<00:06:10.339> in<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:10.849> knifing

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
there's increased health in this knifing

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.300 
there's increased health in this knifing
is<00:06:11.810> still<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.050> one-hit<00:06:12.589> kill<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.009> will<00:06:13.219> get

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
is still a one-hit kill and you will get

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.459 
is still a one-hit kill and you will get
knifed<00:06:13.610> once<00:06:14.210> like<00:06:14.539> normal<00:06:15.020> even<00:06:15.379> though

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
knifed once like normal even though

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.290 
knifed once like normal even though
knife<00:06:15.680> thing<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:16.039> think<00:06:16.250> it<00:06:16.370> does<00:06:16.520> 100<00:06:17.120> damage

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
knife thing I think it does 100 damage

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.309 
knife thing I think it does 100 damage
and<00:06:17.659> you're<00:06:17.750> supposed<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:18.020> have<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.169> hundred

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
and you're supposed to have a hundred

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.990 
and you're supposed to have a hundred
health<00:06:18.620> even<00:06:19.069> though<00:06:19.250> it's<00:06:19.339> increase<00:06:19.759> it's

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
health even though it's increase it's

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.360 
health even though it's increase it's
not<00:06:20.210> exactly<00:06:20.539> double<00:06:20.960> health<00:06:21.169> but<00:06:21.560> a<00:06:21.589> knifing

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
not exactly double health but a knifing

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.059 
not exactly double health but a knifing
it's<00:06:22.580> still<00:06:22.879> a<00:06:22.909> one<00:06:23.270> hit<00:06:23.539> kill<00:06:23.839> however<00:06:24.650> but

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
it's still a one hit kill however but

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.649 
it's still a one hit kill however but
this<00:06:25.159> game-mode<00:06:25.370> does<00:06:25.759> there<00:06:26.000> feel<00:06:26.180> really

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
this game-mode does there feel really

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.809 
this game-mode does there feel really
good<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:26.900> really<00:06:27.020> love<00:06:27.589> how<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:27.979> plays<00:06:28.219> I'm<00:06:28.669> not

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
good I really love how it plays I'm not

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:29.800 
good I really love how it plays I'm not
sure<00:06:28.969> whether<00:06:29.120> it's<00:06:29.270> just<00:06:29.389> the<00:06:29.479> placebo

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
sure whether it's just the placebo

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.779 
sure whether it's just the placebo
effect<00:06:30.020> because<00:06:30.860> I'm<00:06:31.009> told<00:06:31.219> I<00:06:31.400> have<00:06:31.580> more

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
effect because I'm told I have more

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.610 
effect because I'm told I have more
health<00:06:32.029> that<00:06:32.449> I<00:06:32.479> just<00:06:32.750> play<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:33.169> enjoy<00:06:33.440> it<00:06:33.560> a

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
health that I just play and enjoy it a

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.889 
health that I just play and enjoy it a
lot<00:06:33.860> more<00:06:34.130> but<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:34.669> does<00:06:34.849> feel<00:06:35.209> so<00:06:35.479> much<00:06:35.630> better

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899 
lot more but it does feel so much better

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.659 
lot more but it does feel so much better
and<00:06:36.289> I've<00:06:36.409> played<00:06:36.589> a<00:06:36.620> few<00:06:36.860> games<00:06:36.919> on<00:06:37.310> this<00:06:37.520> and

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
and I've played a few games on this and

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:38.379 
and I've played a few games on this and
all

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
all

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.119 
all
just<00:06:38.900> felt<00:06:39.080> really<00:06:39.259> good<00:06:39.349> all<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.710> gunfights

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
just felt really good all the gunfights

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.070 
just felt really good all the gunfights
just<00:06:40.340> feel<00:06:40.550> really<00:06:40.849> natural<00:06:41.150> because<00:06:41.840> you're

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
just feel really natural because you're

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.570 
just feel really natural because you're
not<00:06:42.169> just<00:06:42.289> getting<00:06:42.469> destroyed<00:06:42.919> in<00:06:43.159> like<00:06:43.340> two

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
not just getting destroyed in like two

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.100 
not just getting destroyed in like two
bullets<00:06:43.879> as<00:06:44.180> normal<00:06:44.569> because<00:06:44.810> for<00:06:44.960> some

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
bullets as normal because for some

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.290 
bullets as normal because for some
reason<00:06:45.139> they<00:06:46.129> want<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.430> make<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.669> games<00:06:46.879> fast

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
reason they want to make the games fast

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.360 
reason they want to make the games fast
start<00:06:47.599> and<00:06:47.689> kill<00:06:47.990> faster<00:06:48.560> and<00:06:48.800> just<00:06:48.979> the<00:06:49.099> guns

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
start and kill faster and just the guns

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.249 
start and kill faster and just the guns
have<00:06:49.879> less<00:06:50.120> and<00:06:50.270> less<00:06:50.330> recoil<00:06:50.629> it's<00:06:51.050> kind<00:06:51.229> of

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259 
have less and less recoil it's kind of

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.230 
have less and less recoil it's kind of
easy<00:06:51.500> to<00:06:51.740> kill<00:06:51.919> people<00:06:52.129> but<00:06:52.669> in<00:06:52.759> this<00:06:52.879> takes<00:06:53.150> a

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
easy to kill people but in this takes a

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.420 
easy to kill people but in this takes a
lot<00:06:53.389> more<00:06:53.419> skill<00:06:53.719> as<00:06:54.169> I've<00:06:54.349> said<00:06:54.560> black<00:06:55.009> ops<00:06:55.219> 1

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
lot more skill as I've said black ops 1

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.459 
lot more skill as I've said black ops 1
was<00:06:55.639> my<00:06:55.759> all-time<00:06:56.000> favorite<00:06:56.900> Call<00:06:57.080> of<00:06:57.110> Duty

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
was my all-time favorite Call of Duty

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:58.839 
was my all-time favorite Call of Duty
simply<00:06:57.889> because<00:06:58.129> of<00:06:58.159> how<00:06:58.340> much<00:06:58.520> health<00:06:58.789> you

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
simply because of how much health you

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.300 
simply because of how much health you
had<00:06:59.180> and<00:06:59.389> there<00:06:59.870> you<00:06:59.990> could<00:07:00.139> choose<00:07:00.439> to<00:07:00.469> enter

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
had and there you could choose to enter

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.010 
had and there you could choose to enter
a<00:07:01.340> gun<00:07:01.520> fight<00:07:01.759> or<00:07:01.879> not<00:07:02.120> if<00:07:02.360> you<00:07:02.599> got<00:07:02.689> hit<00:07:02.900> by

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
a gun fight or not if you got hit by

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.240 
a gun fight or not if you got hit by
something<00:07:03.229> you<00:07:03.319> could<00:07:03.500> actually<00:07:03.620> run<00:07:03.949> away

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
something you could actually run away

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.219 
something you could actually run away
and<00:07:04.520> just<00:07:04.669> completely<00:07:05.000> evade<00:07:05.389> them<00:07:05.689> you<00:07:06.080> could

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
and just completely evade them you could

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.689 
and just completely evade them you could
have<00:07:06.319> the<00:07:06.469> choice<00:07:06.710> but<00:07:06.919> in<00:07:07.039> this<00:07:07.189> if<00:07:07.370> you<00:07:07.400> see

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
have the choice but in this if you see

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:09.159 
have the choice but in this if you see
someone<00:07:08.000> you're<00:07:08.120> pretty<00:07:08.419> much<00:07:08.659> dead<00:07:08.900> there's

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
someone you're pretty much dead there's

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.260 
someone you're pretty much dead there's
not<00:07:09.289> really<00:07:09.409> many<00:07:09.860> options<00:07:10.490> you<00:07:10.699> have<00:07:10.909> in<00:07:11.090> this

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
not really many options you have in this

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.339 
not really many options you have in this
but<00:07:11.479> one<00:07:11.629> thing<00:07:11.840> I<00:07:11.900> would<00:07:12.020> definitely

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:12.349 
but one thing I would definitely

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.469 
but one thing I would definitely
recommend<00:07:12.439> is<00:07:12.919> the<00:07:13.370> perk<00:07:13.580> focus<00:07:14.180> that<00:07:14.330> is

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
recommend is the perk focus that is

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.570 
recommend is the perk focus that is
essential<00:07:15.080> in<00:07:15.289> this<00:07:15.469> game<00:07:15.710> mode<00:07:15.919> because

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
essential in this game mode because

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.800 
essential in this game mode because
there<00:07:16.789> because<00:07:17.029> there's<00:07:17.180> more<00:07:17.300> health<00:07:17.569> you'll

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
there because there's more health you'll

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.390 
there because there's more health you'll
get<00:07:17.960> in<00:07:18.020> here<00:07:18.229> a<00:07:18.259> lot<00:07:18.439> more<00:07:18.650> you<00:07:19.009> getting<00:07:19.250> hit

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
get in here a lot more you getting hit

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.429 
get in here a lot more you getting hit
markered<00:07:19.879> a<00:07:20.029> lot<00:07:20.210> more<00:07:20.449> so<00:07:20.719> away<00:07:20.930> you<00:07:20.990> won't<00:07:21.349> be

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:21.439 
markered a lot more so away you won't be

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.469 
markered a lot more so away you won't be
getting<00:07:21.680> jolted<00:07:22.129> off<00:07:22.340> your<00:07:22.789> aim<00:07:23.060> I<00:07:23.090> wasn't

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
getting jolted off your aim I wasn't

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:24.519 
getting jolted off your aim I wasn't
actually<00:07:23.569> running<00:07:23.810> in<00:07:23.960> this<00:07:24.050> game<00:07:24.259> mode<00:07:24.500> but

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:24.529 
actually running in this game mode but

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.189 
actually running in this game mode but
their<00:07:25.009> focus<00:07:25.189> is<00:07:25.729> definitely<00:07:26.060> a<00:07:26.330> perk<00:07:26.719> to<00:07:26.750> run

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
their focus is definitely a perk to run

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.559 
their focus is definitely a perk to run
and<00:07:27.379> so<00:07:28.039> just<00:07:28.189> here<00:07:28.460> I<00:07:28.490> managed<00:07:28.939> to<00:07:29.000> pick<00:07:29.240> up<00:07:29.360> a
