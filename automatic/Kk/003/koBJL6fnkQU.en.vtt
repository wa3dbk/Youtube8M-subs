00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.650

 really all the heroes it will be the same 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.610

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.920
 can face is contorted 6013 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.449
 girls stopped at now it takes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 it takes a good spirit to whip the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.770
 forms one has to be relaxed if one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.780
 is christian I have a language I know 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.270
 that tell the twins then and I 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 family want to come back and I place myself 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.830
 it should not be pressed to do I 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 pose by saying it's not denying this 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.130
 rhythm we will have reached Islamic rose 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.729
 no we are seen as she does us 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 shows vestiges le pauliste effect lo 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.570
 why because it's not blocked 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 at the departure level there I resume 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 always resumes equality but your 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 sides and members fired her double 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 so it has to be an engine at the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.210
 rent a little more conceded of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.939
 inside so I resume this after 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.260
 I you france my pendulum is my 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.990
 honor for us 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.290
 and here I am kindly looking for the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 poses years and I really come the other 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.030
 you're blocking on the ball ok it's 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.030
 visible and and I ask it he's not going and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 do it and go away will not go months 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.550
 to the mother of the family I choose it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 challenge reviewed at roma and I resume I 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.160
 close and there I balance to another nothing 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 block you like that it's a trick 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.350
 it's a course andrÃ© joffre to take the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.290
 mind and under master's degree is a master's 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.300
 of self and to pose and to be calm 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.450
 to do it that's hard I 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 recently stolen it's good for the method 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.700
 never alone then it would have to be our 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.010
 deals - VIVALIS is not to remake it 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 looks we will send a new moment 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.900
 stronger than ever because because it 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.020
 means you have to shell out the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.020
 guen 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:35.700

 for that 1 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.019
 2 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.019
 harris 36.1 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.280
 I took it one inch 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.280
 offer 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.209
 and you they are required on each side and 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.849
 the lotois visions are there who blocked 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.469

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:15.219

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.349
 happens to open misery would then have 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.639
 we almost think we should know 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.680
 that when you succeed you do not 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.200
 do not think about the last row 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.319
 you shrink and get three 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.290
 years old boyfriend a good man 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.510
 sure but to do the rounded wii is born 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.859

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.349
 every time you draw on his honor 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.419
 courses and stories narrowed not on the 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.430
 last row meece narrowed the ranks 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.040
 who are above if yes yes in the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.859
 street that's why you have to go there 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.389
 sweetness that we have left at nantes 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.040
 on the right side joined damage on the 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.109
 mounds of the prefect grinds good but we have 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 always a pc that died while 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:16.829
 his teeth 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:32.010
