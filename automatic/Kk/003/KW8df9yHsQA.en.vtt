 they give you to download the file it takes 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:11.420
 around 11 minutes and they give to 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.620
 download for free and it will start not because 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.620

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.090
 and in the folders are the mods all 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.770
 they bring their text file where it says 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.770
 how it is installed and how are they used 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.030
 and some brings an image of the way where 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.300
 the place is located but not at all only 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.150
 in some edges 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.220
 but whenever they install they do not make a 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.970
 backup since I do not want 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.060

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.560

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.530

 Fucking fucking etc. for breaking the tape 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.080
 so whenever they install one they are 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.000
 Break the game before installing it 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.220
 a backup of the files 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 they will never replace as 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 know if the mold is reliable or not or 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.000
 if fire breaks or not 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.610
