let's see here

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.569 
let's see here
okay<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.870> intimidate<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.739> especially

on<00:00:38.820> donphan<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.989> donphan<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:40.649> has

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
on donphan because donphan actually has

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
on donphan because donphan actually has
really<00:00:41.190> high<00:00:41.340> base<00:00:41.700> attack<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:43.290> he<00:00:43.410> can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
really high base attack I think he can

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
really high base attack I think he can
get<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> 189<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> Mac<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.899> that's

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
get up to 189 as a Mac so that's

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.630 
get up to 189 as a Mac so that's
actually<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> barely

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
actually really good that's just barely

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.779 
actually really good that's just barely

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
looking for a physical attacker but with

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.100 
looking for a physical attacker but with
like<00:00:52.590> no<00:00:53.039> special<00:00:53.550> events<00:00:54.020> donphan<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
like no special events donphan is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
like no special events donphan is
definitely<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.620> option<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.730> yeah

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
he's really powerful but he's just kind

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
he's really powerful but he's just kind
of<00:00:59.760> slow<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> he<00:01:01.530> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of slow I'm pretty sure that he doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.780 
of slow I'm pretty sure that he doesn't
have<00:01:02.780> an<00:01:03.780> attack<00:01:04.199> boosting<00:01:04.949> move<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.430> than

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
have an attack boosting move other than

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.620 
have an attack boosting move other than
curse<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> only<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.450> him

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
curse so the only way I can see him

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
curse so the only way I can see him
working<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.170> either<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.640> big

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
working is either like just a really big

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
working is either like just a really big
cursed<00:01:12.360> spammer<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> start<00:01:13.560> going

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
cursed spammer and then you start going

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
cursed spammer and then you start going
for<00:01:13.950> ice<00:01:14.100> shard<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:15.240> maybe<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.259> occurs<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
for ice shard or maybe just occurs in

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.800 
for ice shard or maybe just occurs in
the<00:01:17.070> trig<00:01:17.400> room<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.509> see

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
the trig room that's about all I can see

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.390 
the trig room that's about all I can see
unless<00:01:20.590> somebody<00:01:20.860> else<00:01:20.979> can<00:01:21.100> come<00:01:21.130> up<00:01:21.310> with

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
unless somebody else can come up with

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.850 
unless somebody else can come up with
something<00:01:21.610> better<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.570> uh<00:01:22.720> maybe<00:01:23.380> something

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
something better and uh maybe something

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.530 
something better and uh maybe something
with<00:01:23.979> swagger<00:01:24.580> that<00:01:24.610> could<00:01:24.970> definitely<00:01:25.150> work

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
with swagger that could definitely work
