 until now compensate 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 m12 effect i would say we do 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.230

 Ulm really dry 11 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.079
 finally resume 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.820
 when I am back with problems 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.549

 Run 5 times 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 and I believe in a distinctive way 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.879
 once 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.870
 approved and also men can 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.870

 had exactly on it 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.360
 so do not believe that does not lose the percent 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.009
 so often 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.919
 Varela percent a year earlier
