00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
jump over in the first kids like this

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.359 
jump over in the first kids like this
and<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.599> couple<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:04.990> zombies<00:02:05.380> what

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
and so that's a couple of zombies what

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.609 
and so that's a couple of zombies what
do<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.819> not<00:02:07.119> too<00:02:07.300> many<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.200> glitch<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
do that not too many and this glitch is

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.650 
do that not too many and this glitch is
great<00:02:09.099> for<00:02:09.640> semi<00:02:10.420> high<00:02:10.630> rounds<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.300> said

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
great for semi high rounds and as I said

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.400 
great for semi high rounds and as I said
semi<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.110> mean<00:02:14.349> maybe<00:02:14.980> around<00:02:15.420> 2025<00:02:16.420> its<00:02:16.959> max

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
semi I mean maybe around 2025 its max

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.040 
semi I mean maybe around 2025 its max
just<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.520> lot<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.239> zombies<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.870> get

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
just because a lot of zombies can get

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410 
just because a lot of zombies can get
piled<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.830> if<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.670> many<00:02:21.819> zombies<00:02:22.239> do

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
piled up here and if so many zombies do

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.390 
piled up here and if so many zombies do
get<00:02:22.630> piled<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:23.080> they<00:02:23.530> will<00:02:23.709> start<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> hit<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
get piled up they will start to hit you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
as long as you've got a decent gun you

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.160
