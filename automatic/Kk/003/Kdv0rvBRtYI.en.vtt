acceleration is again somewhat

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.820 
acceleration is again somewhat
controversial<00:00:12.570> because<00:00:12.960> you'll<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.530> some

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hockey player ever start like this off

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
hockey player ever start like this off
of<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> face-off<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.650> a<00:00:34.770> ready<00:00:35.010> position

of a face-off or in a ready position

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.060 
of a face-off or in a ready position
like<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.090> always<00:00:36.330> like<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.800> as

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like this it's always like this so as

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.510 
like this it's always like this so as
that<00:00:38.400> translates<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.330> into<00:00:39.810> acceleration<00:00:40.520> we

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that translates now into acceleration we

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
that translates now into acceleration we
also<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.450> incorporate<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.320> into<00:00:43.650> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
also want to incorporate that into the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
also want to incorporate that into the
start<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> acceleration<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.900> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
start of the acceleration so you want to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
start of the acceleration so you want to
tell<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> players<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.130> get<00:00:47.310> in<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> goody<00:00:47.700> ready

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
tell the players to get in a goody ready

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.960 
tell the players to get in a goody ready
position<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.470> coaching<00:00:50.010> points<00:00:50.580> for

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
position some of the coaching points for

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.440 
position some of the coaching points for
acceleration<00:00:51.630> include<00:00:52.670> trying<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.880> dis<00:00:54.060> push

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
acceleration include trying to dis push

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.710 
acceleration include trying to dis push
and<00:00:54.720> go<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.470> it's<00:00:55.680> interesting<00:00:55.830> because

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
and go now it's interesting because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.810 
and go now it's interesting because
sometimes<00:00:57.720> some<00:00:57.990> players<00:00:58.290> will<00:00:58.650> cross<00:00:59.520> over

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
sometimes some players will cross over

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170 
sometimes some players will cross over
hop<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.470> acceleration<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.490> that's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hop to do an acceleration now that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.110 
hop to do an acceleration now that's
okay<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> realize<00:01:05.190> generally

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
okay but you have to realize generally

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.520 
okay but you have to realize generally
speaking<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.870> slower<00:01:07.230> way<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
speaking that's a slower way to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710 
speaking that's a slower way to
accelerate<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.090> been<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> couple<00:01:09.300> of

fastest<00:01:36.390> skating<00:01:36.720> competition<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> because

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
fastest skating competition is because

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
fastest skating competition is because
he<00:01:38.430> didn't<00:01:38.909> hop<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> he<00:01:39.870> didn't<00:01:40.170> cross<00:01:40.409> over

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

he didn't hop and he didn't cross over
when<00:01:41.040> he<00:01:41.070> accelerated<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.510> interesting

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
when he accelerated it was interesting

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.060 
when he accelerated it was interesting
to<00:01:43.200> watch<00:01:43.940> Horcoff<00:01:44.940> race<00:01:45.690> first<00:01:46.080> Campbell<00:01:46.890> and
