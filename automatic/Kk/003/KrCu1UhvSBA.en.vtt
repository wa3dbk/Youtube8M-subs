00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.780
 Here it is from above but like you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.179
 Looks a bit colorful I have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 here all for the German 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.880
 market planned color variants for the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.260
 Samsung Galaxy s4 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.640
 I already had that one for you 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.050
 Comparison of the white of the black 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.340
 version shown at the black 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.689
 version is always so contentious 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.949
 if she really is that black because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 depending on the incidence of light, it is more likely 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 I like silver now have good 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.300
 meanwhile I myself have ordered 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 I then decided against the white 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 which I like or that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.410
 pattern ensures that it is relatively bright 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.079
 is and not like the galaxy s3 ever 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 after she has her creamy tone on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 every case comes to germany too 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 the blue version 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 we have here blue version is just 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 brown as you see and on the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 front page that is here and there now 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 you can see around the display below 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 the glass but blue metallic look 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.370
 always with this predator pattern 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.039
 I definitely like that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 it is not like that now 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.000
 light blue is just still a halfway 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.189
 subtle dark blue metallic blue can 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.620
 you definitely still take the red 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.210
 version but really what 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.350
 for certain tastes me personally 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.410
 It would be too intrusive then 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.150
 Well, maybe it suits then 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 one to the ferrari fits it then only 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.120
 to one or the other handbag 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.040
 that's a bit that wants a 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 But taste has ours again 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 surface of this diamond pattern 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.509
 in this respect also the normal one 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.280
 sp ends this is so red cool 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.750
 impression is of course cool here in 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.340
 real version would because I believe in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.289
 the display is black and you have it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 bottom of this red I think that looks 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.740
 really chic so I want that now 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.479
 It does not say anything else about style 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.909
 this is something for certain tastes 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.409
 but bad is not all 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.179
 I really like what you have there 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.229
 samsung wants to come up with new colors 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.159
 probably hit again 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.990
 nachschieÃŸen 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 We are definitely up to date for the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.020
 German market planned red and blue 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.189
 partly available partially already 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.080
 listed must have a look again 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.429
 I hope this short phase overview 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.690
 I like you alaska 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.580
 autobots samsung and if you ask 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.270
 have as always once in the short 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.890
 Comments 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.759
 Subscription also does not harm unread 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.759
 like the daily paper
