lens we have an 85 1 to 135 F 235 1/4
this<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.470> an<00:01:14.560> 85<00:01:14.890> millimeter<00:01:15.250> 1/8<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.030> 50

this is an 85 millimeter 1/8 and a 50
millimeter<00:01:16.479> 1/4<00:01:17.050> one<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.409> things<00:01:17.560> we<00:01:17.710> like

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
millimeter 1/4 one of the things we like

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.620 
millimeter 1/4 one of the things we like
to<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.220> stack<00:01:18.520> they'll<00:01:18.790> stack<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.330> lenses

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
to do is stack they'll stack the lenses

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.539 
to do is stack they'll stack the lenses
together<00:01:19.870> with<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.110> stacking<00:01:20.590> cap<00:01:20.799> by<00:01:21.310> stacking

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
together with a stacking cap by stacking

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.130 
together with a stacking cap by stacking
them<00:01:21.820> up<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.150> allows<00:01:22.450> us<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.780> store<00:01:22.990> them

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
them up it just allows us to store them

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.180 
them up it just allows us to store them
easier<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.590> bag<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:23.979> they're<00:01:24.070> not

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
easier in the bag and they're not

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.070 
easier in the bag and they're not
bouncing<00:01:24.610> around<00:01:24.700> as<00:01:25.000> much<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.660> reason<00:01:25.990> that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
bouncing around as much the reason that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.550 
bouncing around as much the reason that
we<00:01:26.200> have<00:01:26.350> an<00:01:26.440> 85<00:01:26.890> 1/8<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.850> an<00:01:28.210> 85<00:01:28.600> 1<00:01:28.840> 2<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
85 1/8 is the lens we have to use when

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.820 
keep it in the think tank case instead
what<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.480> might<00:02:35.660> do<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.020> transfer<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.590> some<00:02:36.740> of

we're ready to go one of the other
points<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.800> want<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.010> make<00:04:03.160> about<00:04:03.310> these

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
points I want to make about these

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.160 
points I want to make about these
flashes<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.240> lot<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.570> times<00:04:04.780> we'll<00:04:04.960> put<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
flashes is a lot of times we'll put a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.070 
flashes is a lot of times we'll put a
CTO<00:04:05.740> or<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.370> green<00:04:06.970> gel<00:04:07.270> in<00:04:07.420> front<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.870> so

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
CTO or a green gel in front of that so

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.960 
CTO or a green gel in front of that so
that<00:04:08.200> we<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.470> use<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.800> strobe<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.310> match<00:04:09.700> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
that we can use the strobe and match the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
that we can use the strobe and match the
strobe<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.570> color<00:04:10.780> temperature<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
strobe to the color temperature of the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.990 
strobe to the color temperature of the
environment<00:04:11.980> we're<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.340> whether<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:12.910> a

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
environment we're in whether it's a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.400 
environment we're in whether it's a
tungsten<00:04:13.240> color<00:04:13.600> temperature<00:04:14.170> or<00:04:14.350> a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
tungsten color temperature or a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.680 
tungsten color temperature or a
fluorescent<00:04:15.070> environment<00:04:15.910> using<00:04:16.570> these

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
fluorescent environment using these

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.630 
fluorescent environment using these
different<00:04:17.080> gels<00:04:17.350> allows<00:04:17.830> us<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.220> match<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
different gels allows us to match the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.300 
different gels allows us to match the
strobe<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.930> room<00:04:20.140> color<00:04:20.500> temperature<00:04:21.010> so

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
strobe to the room color temperature so

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.500 
strobe to the room color temperature so
that's<00:04:21.460> how<00:04:21.610> we<00:04:21.670> work<00:04:21.880> when<00:04:22.060> we're<00:04:22.180> not<00:04:22.300> using

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
that's how we work when we're not using

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.090 
that's how we work when we're not using
the<00:04:22.750> think-tanks<00:04:23.290> airport<00:04:23.710> security

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
the think-tanks airport security

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.350 
the think-tanks airport security
equipment<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.520> instead<00:04:24.790> we<00:04:24.910> want<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.150> travel

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
equipment and instead we want to travel

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.420 
equipment and instead we want to travel
light<00:04:25.750> well<00:04:26.320> take<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.560> nut<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.070> get<00:04:27.220> rid<00:04:27.400> of

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
light well take a nut and get rid of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
light well take a nut and get rid of
this<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.580> how<00:04:33.700> we<00:04:33.760> travel<00:04:34.090> light<00:04:34.330> this

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
this so this is how we travel light this

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
this so this is how we travel light this
is<00:04:34.570> actually<00:04:34.870> how<00:04:34.930> we<00:04:34.990> shoulder<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
is actually how we shoulder the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.050 
is actually how we shoulder the
equipment<00:04:35.860> our<00:04:36.130> strobes<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.700> zooms<00:04:36.910> and

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
equipment our strobes and zooms and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.950 
equipment our strobes and zooms and
extra<00:04:37.420> battery

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
extra battery

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.850 
extra battery
go<00:04:38.320> on<00:04:38.470> one<00:04:38.650> shoulder<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:41.080> other<00:04:41.110> zooms<00:04:41.590> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
go on one shoulder the other zooms the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.890 
go on one shoulder the other zooms the
others<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.280> other<00:04:42.430> strobe<00:04:43.110> closes<00:04:44.110> up<00:04:45.900> goes

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
others the other strobe closes up goes

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.990 
others the other strobe closes up goes
on<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.140> other<00:04:47.260> shoulder<00:04:47.730> we<00:04:48.730> don't<00:04:48.880> always

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
on the other shoulder we don't always

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.060 
on the other shoulder we don't always
take<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.360> fast<00:04:49.570> glass<00:04:49.900> with<00:04:50.170> us<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.860> now<00:04:50.980> that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
take the fast glass with us so now that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.890 
take the fast glass with us so now that
we've<00:04:51.220> got<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.430> bags<00:04:51.640> on<00:04:52.380> on<00:04:53.380> go<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> cameras

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
we've got the bags on on go to cameras

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.050 
we've got the bags on on go to cameras
one<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:56.050> either<00:04:56.200> side<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.940> we're<00:04:58.720> ready<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.960> go

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
one on either side and we're ready to go

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.460 
one on either side and we're ready to go
this<00:05:01.060> believe<00:05:01.450> it<00:05:01.570> or<00:05:01.660> not<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:02.020> traveling

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
this believe it or not is traveling

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.650 
this believe it or not is traveling
light
