00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.460
 so let's continue if you had asked 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.480
 only the burning in the particles is missing 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.959
 I decided to put 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.769
 this final part and together 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.349
 Why should I wait 3 to shoot? 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.719
 posted curial of three minutes the staff and want to kill nÃ© 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.949
 So let's get on with it. 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.310
 same thing 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.079
 let's arrive 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.019
 the website visibility the knits team only on Christmas this 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.250
 of the customer 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.000
 twice until it turns red see only the particles on the screen 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 then I'll double-click Aquino until I'm stuck twice 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.050
 so I can select the by block 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.950
 return with it here in my panel of tributes so I can minimize here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.350
 and an important thing to make grandson if the order had reversed in the case being 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.720
 the competition that in the first 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.370
 now see yourself 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 if the particles go from side to side 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.030
 we try to cheer and this now 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.690
 told in the area that in the beginning 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.980
 the zero point 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.070
 bechara 15 0% 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.200
 press until you found 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.640
 to click on what went beyond 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.030
 checking 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580
 cremation 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.880
 I read stuff by the way 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.330
 the opera one night for 100% 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.380
 Ricky again presses the find until it turns red 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.160
 So this will give me 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 animation of the particles from side to side 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.410
 raise awareness here you see 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.410
 the material thud applied there from inside 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 so we have these three colors involved 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 earth was much more interesting the thing you see right 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 resettled 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.000
 we can have proposals like render in detail 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.450
 in the last of the real because I will not repeat the procedure and tried 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.729
 so if you have not seen 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.729
 this one asked to speak the editorial 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 video pain so we split the course 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.979
