00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
use a primer that's going to work well

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.320 
use a primer that's going to work well
in<00:00:41.650> photography<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.190> also<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.910> gives<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.210> nice

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
in photography and also it gives a nice

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.200 
in photography and also it gives a nice
base<00:00:43.660> for<00:00:43.900> your<00:00:44.080> foundation<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.580> decided<00:00:46.059> to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
base for your foundation so I decided to

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.459 
base for your foundation so I decided to
go<00:00:46.330> with<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.629> bourgeois<00:00:46.989> happy<00:00:47.320> light

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
go with the bourgeois happy light

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.020 
go with the bourgeois happy light
foundation<00:00:47.950> because<00:00:48.100> this<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.640> supposed<00:00:48.940> to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
foundation because this is supposed to

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.970 
foundation because this is supposed to
be<00:00:49.090> good<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.390> any<00:00:49.600> sort<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:50.110> light<00:00:50.379> so<00:00:50.770> it

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
be good in any sort of light so it

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.100 
be good in any sort of light so it
doesn't<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.340> SPF<00:00:51.700> I<00:00:51.940> don't<00:00:52.120> think<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.960> it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
doesn't have SPF I don't think so it's

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.270 
doesn't have SPF I don't think so it's
not<00:00:53.200> going<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.379> flush<00:00:53.590> back<00:00:53.770> on<00:00:53.890> pictures

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
not going to flush back on pictures

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.670 
not going to flush back on pictures
which<00:00:54.460> most<00:00:55.450> foundations<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.110> have<00:00:56.200> an<00:00:56.350> SPF

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
which most foundations that have an SPF

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.490 
which most foundations that have an SPF
will<00:00:56.860> do<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:58.629> got<00:00:58.809> nice<00:00:58.989> coverage<00:00:59.379> and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
will do and it's got nice coverage and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.810 
will do and it's got nice coverage and
its<00:00:59.590> really<00:00:59.739> hydrating<00:01:00.309> but<00:01:00.399> if<00:01:00.520> you've<00:01:00.670> got

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
its really hydrating but if you've got

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.910 
its really hydrating but if you've got
oily<00:01:01.210> skin<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.750> probably<00:01:02.289> wouldn't<00:01:02.739> say<00:01:02.890> that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
oily skin and probably wouldn't say that

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.079 
oily skin and probably wouldn't say that
it's<00:01:03.100> going<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.309> work<00:01:03.460> for<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.699> because<00:01:04.059> I

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
it's going to work for you because I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.969 
it's going to work for you because I
just<00:01:04.330> think<00:01:04.479> it<00:01:04.600> would<00:01:04.660> be<00:01:04.720> too<00:01:04.809> hydrating<00:01:05.740> in

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
just think it would be too hydrating in

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.950 
just think it would be too hydrating in
hindsight<00:01:06.399> because<00:01:07.000> at<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.360> point<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.780> no

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
hindsight because at this point have no

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.389 
hindsight because at this point have no
idea<00:01:08.229> what<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.619> do<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.950> would<00:01:09.280> have

under<00:01:40.270> under<00:01:40.720> eye<00:01:40.810> concealer<00:01:40.920> after<00:01:41.920> but<00:01:42.459> at

under under eye concealer after but at

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.889 
under under eye concealer after but at
this<00:01:42.700> point<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.119> had<00:01:43.239> no<00:01:43.390> idea<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.840> was

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
this point I had no idea what I was

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:53.010 
this point I had no idea what I was
going<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> do<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.739> was<00:01:44.920> winging<00:01:45.130> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.690 

then<00:01:53.680> going<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.039> with<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> makeup<00:01:54.460> revolution

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
then going in with the makeup revolution

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.910 
then going in with the makeup revolution
blush<00:01:55.390> stick<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> contour<00:01:56.560> cream

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
blush stick this is a contour cream

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.770 
blush stick this is a contour cream
stick<00:01:57.340> now<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.820> does<00:01:57.969> look<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.179> bit<00:01:58.210> scary<00:01:58.630> when

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
stick now it does look a bit scary when

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.660 
stick now it does look a bit scary when
you<00:01:58.899> first<00:01:59.109> put<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.409> on<00:01:59.530> but<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.219> blends<00:02:00.460> out

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
you first put it on but it blends out

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.910 
you first put it on but it blends out
beautifully<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.659> not<00:02:02.289> only<00:02:02.409> does<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.679> make

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
beautifully and not only does it make

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.959 
beautifully and not only does it make
you<00:02:02.950> contour<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.429> little<00:02:03.579> bit<00:02:03.670> more<00:02:03.789> dramatic

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
you contour a little bit more dramatic

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.340 
you contour a little bit more dramatic

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
crease just as a transition color

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.510 
crease just as a transition color
because<00:03:12.050> we're<00:03:12.200> using<00:03:12.290> such<00:03:12.680> dark<00:03:13.010> colors<00:03:13.370> on

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
because we're using such dark colors on

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.070 
because we're using such dark colors on
the<00:03:13.640> eyes<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:14.330> will<00:03:14.450> really<00:03:14.600> want<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.930> make

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the eyes you will really want to make

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.420 
the eyes you will really want to make
sure<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.440> you've<00:03:15.530> got<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.680> transition<00:03:16.220> color

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
sure that you've got a transition color

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.310 
sure that you've got a transition color
and<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.390> color<00:03:17.600> kind<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.110> has<00:03:18.290> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and that you the color kind of has a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.960 
and that you the color kind of has a
gradient<00:03:18.860> effect<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.520> just<00:03:19.610> looks<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
gradient effect because it just looks a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.360 
gradient effect because it just looks a
lot<00:03:20.060> nicer<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:21.860> I'm<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.340> with

not<00:03:55.310> going<00:03:55.550> all<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.850> way<00:03:55.910> up<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.180> crease

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
not going all the way up to the crease

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.090 
not going all the way up to the crease
because<00:03:56.720> when<00:03:57.020> you<00:03:57.140> start<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.560> blend<00:03:57.710> this<00:03:57.890> out

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
because when you start to blend this out

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.800 
because when you start to blend this out
it<00:03:58.370> will<00:03:58.580> kind<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.880> gradually<00:03:59.090> work<00:03:59.480> its<00:03:59.690> way

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it will kind of gradually work its way

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.630 
it will kind of gradually work its way
up<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.080> crease<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.920> if<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.160> went<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.490> to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
the crease with it like this should end

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.540 
the crease with it like this should end
up<00:04:03.020> all<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> way<00:04:03.710> up<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.860> your<00:04:04.040> freaking<00:04:04.370> brow
