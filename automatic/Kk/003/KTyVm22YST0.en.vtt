about this like I said I could be wrong
so<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.370> looked<00:03:23.730> at<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.330> figured<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.750> out

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so I looked at that and I figured it out

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.010 
so I looked at that and I figured it out
and<00:03:25.230> what<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.800> did<00:03:26.160> was<00:03:26.460> I've<00:03:27.240> taken<00:03:27.660> this

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and what I did was I've taken this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.510 
and what I did was I've taken this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
nothing really happens because this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.880 
nothing really happens because this
plastic<00:03:34.950> goes<00:03:35.160> all<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.400> way<00:03:36.150> around<00:03:36.890> this

that<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.520> grass<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.180> there<00:04:57.330> dirt

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
that this grass in there dirt

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.189 
that this grass in there dirt
accumulates<00:04:58.560> over<00:04:59.190> time<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> suggest<00:05:00.599> about

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
accumulates over time so I suggest about

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.159 
accumulates over time so I suggest about
1-2<00:05:01.800> month<00:05:02.009> doing<00:05:03.000> this<00:05:03.180> once<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.139> that

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
1-2 month doing this once you do that

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.170 
1-2 month doing this once you do that
and<00:05:04.949> you<00:05:05.039> clean<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.460> out<00:05:05.520> real<00:05:05.849> good<00:05:06.000> you

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
and you clean that out real good you

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.059 
and you clean that out real good you
could<00:05:06.300> even<00:05:06.479> get<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> vacuum<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.560> wanted<00:05:07.889> to

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
could even get a vacuum if you wanted to

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.510 
could even get a vacuum if you wanted to
that's<00:05:08.310> probably<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.819> better<00:05:09.210> way<00:05:09.509> to<00:05:09.569> doing<00:05:10.020> it

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
that's probably a better way to doing it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.749 
that's probably a better way to doing it
you<00:05:11.520> get<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.729> nice<00:05:12.050> powerful<00:05:13.050> vacuum<00:05:13.550> suck<00:05:14.550> all

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
you get a nice powerful vacuum suck all

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.029 
you get a nice powerful vacuum suck all
that<00:05:15.000> stuff<00:05:15.300> out<00:05:15.539> of<00:05:15.569> there<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.710> what<00:05:16.889> you

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
that stuff out of there and what you

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.710 
that stuff out of there and what you
want<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.430> is<00:05:17.669> I'm<00:05:17.880> gonna<00:05:18.000> clean<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.449> skin

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
want to do is I'm gonna clean the skin

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.420

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
but I'm just going to show you how

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.219 
but I'm just going to show you how
simple<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:20.970> is<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.150> clean<00:05:21.599> out<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.050> put<00:05:22.199> back

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
simple it is to clean out and put back

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.159 
simple it is to clean out and put back
together<00:05:22.909> just<00:05:23.909> pretty<00:05:24.150> much<00:05:24.360> fold<00:05:24.720> this<00:05:24.930> back

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
together just pretty much fold this back

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:32.160 
together just pretty much fold this back
over<00:05:26.720> like<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:28.220> flip<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.460> hold<00:05:30.120> it

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
over like that flip it hold it

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.610 
over like that flip it hold it
let<00:05:33.010> it<00:05:33.130> pop<00:05:33.280> into<00:05:33.640> place<00:05:33.670> by<00:05:34.180> itself<00:05:34.620> come

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
let it pop into place by itself come

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.360 
let it pop into place by itself come
over<00:05:35.890> here

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
over here

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:44.939 
over here
lip<00:05:37.210> it

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.360 

hold<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.960> flip<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:46.990> again<00:05:47.199> right<00:05:47.680> here<00:05:47.919> and

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
hold it flip it again right here and

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.920 
hold it flip it again right here and
just<00:05:49.499> let<00:05:50.499> it<00:05:50.650> fall<00:05:50.979> into<00:05:51.189> place<00:05:51.719> and<00:05:52.719> there

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
just let it fall into place and there

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.890 
just let it fall into place and there
you<00:05:53.050> go<00:05:53.259> now<00:05:54.069> you<00:05:54.129> take<00:05:54.400> this<00:05:54.729> which<00:05:55.479> do<00:05:55.749> is

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900

you go now you take this which do is
after<00:05:56.319> you're<00:05:56.439> done<00:05:56.620> all<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:57.069> I<00:05:57.340> want<00:05:57.999> to<00:05:58.120> go

the hair and all the junk out of it

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.890 
the hair and all the junk out of it
because<00:06:03.699> what<00:06:03.849> happens<00:06:04.180> is<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.509> doesn't<00:06:04.810> let

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
because what happens is it doesn't let

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.119 
because what happens is it doesn't let
the<00:06:05.020> water<00:06:05.669> drain<00:06:06.669> properly<00:06:07.590> now<00:06:08.590> I've<00:06:08.889> ever

the water drain properly now I've ever
run<00:06:09.400> out<00:06:09.460> of<00:06:10.680> warranty<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:12.279> this<00:06:12.430> was<00:06:12.610> like

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
run out of warranty and this was like

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.540 
run out of warranty and this was like
ten<00:06:13.150> years<00:06:13.330> old<00:06:13.629> and<00:06:14.110> what<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:14.830> would<00:06:15.129> do<00:06:15.310> I'm

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
ten years old and what I would do I'm

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.640 
ten years old and what I would do I'm
not<00:06:15.789> telling<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.360> do<00:06:16.479> this<00:06:16.509> nor<00:06:18.689> I<00:06:19.689> take

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
not telling you to do this nor I take

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.980 
not telling you to do this nor I take
any<00:06:21.219> risk<00:06:21.520> for<00:06:21.759> damages<00:06:22.270> that<00:06:22.300> you<00:06:22.509> do<00:06:22.810> to

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
any risk for damages that you do to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.110 
any risk for damages that you do to
yours<00:06:23.199> but<00:06:23.590> I'm<00:06:24.099> just<00:06:24.400> saying<00:06:24.639> this<00:06:24.879> is<00:06:24.939> just

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
yours but I'm just saying this is just

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.959 
yours but I'm just saying this is just
my<00:06:25.509> opinion<00:06:25.689> if<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:26.949> had<00:06:27.099> to<00:06:27.219> hold<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.520> system

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
my opinion if you had to hold the system

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.019 
my opinion if you had to hold the system
with<00:06:28.150> no<00:06:28.569> warranty<00:06:29.199> um<00:06:29.949> I<00:06:30.490> would<00:06:30.699> make<00:06:30.849> these

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:31.029 
with no warranty um I would make these

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.510 
with no warranty um I would make these
holes<00:06:31.210> bigger<00:06:31.509> by<00:06:31.779> the<00:06:32.080> way<00:06:32.919> you<00:06:32.979> can<00:06:33.189> do<00:06:33.310> that

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
holes bigger by the way you can do that

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.640 
holes bigger by the way you can do that
I'll<00:06:34.210> probably<00:06:34.509> do<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:34.779> in<00:06:34.960> some<00:06:35.319> time<00:06:35.500> in

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
I'll probably do that in some time in

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.429 
I'll probably do that in some time in
the<00:06:35.710> future<00:06:35.969> okay<00:06:36.969> where<00:06:37.270> I<00:06:37.300> have<00:06:37.569> no<00:06:37.839> warranty

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:38.439 
the future okay where I have no warranty

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.200 
the future okay where I have no warranty
because<00:06:38.680> I<00:06:38.800> would<00:06:38.979> not<00:06:39.250> do<00:06:39.430> it<00:06:39.550> now<00:06:39.759> because<00:06:40.089> it

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
because I would not do it now because it

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.619 
because I would not do it now because it
would<00:06:40.300> buoyed<00:06:40.569> the<00:06:40.750> warranty<00:06:41.460> so<00:06:42.629> kids

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
would buoyed the warranty so kids

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.399 
would buoyed the warranty so kids
warranty<00:06:44.050> I'm<00:06:44.139> sorry<00:06:44.409> I<00:06:44.499> keep<00:06:44.680> on<00:06:44.770> saying<00:06:45.370> why

might be able to cause it could drain
better<00:07:00.490> with<00:07:00.729> bigger<00:07:01.029> holes<00:07:01.629> in<00:07:01.930> there<00:07:02.189> you
