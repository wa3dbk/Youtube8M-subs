here<00:00:01.350> we<00:00:01.500> have<00:00:01.680> our<00:00:02.250> vacuum<00:00:02.850> solenoids<00:00:03.389> again

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
here we have our vacuum solenoids again

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.059 
here we have our vacuum solenoids again

min/max<00:00:08.639> again<00:00:08.940> here<00:00:09.150> but<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.540> time<00:00:10.250> we're

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
min/max again here but this time we're

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.450 
min/max again here but this time we're
going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.550> current<00:00:12.440> logic<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.160> current

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
Ben McMillan the maximum current here we

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.340 
Ben McMillan the maximum current here we
have<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> meter<00:00:18.330> again<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.109> see<00:00:19.170> I'm

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
have a meter again and you can see I'm

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429 
have a meter again and you can see I'm
in<00:00:19.470> max<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.480> already<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.930> connected<00:00:22.320> up

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
in max I already have that connected up

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
in max I already have that connected up
for<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> current<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> means<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> meter

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
for a current and that means the meter

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
for a current and that means the meter
is<00:00:24.859> connected<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.250> series<00:00:27.260> that<00:00:28.260> means<00:00:28.439> power

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
is connected in series that means power

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.729 
is connected in series that means power

you're sure what corn sure and got to be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789 
you're sure what corn sure and got to be
measuring<00:01:05.939> should<00:01:06.630> set<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> high<00:01:07.380> Dyess

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
measuring should set it as a high Dyess

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
measuring should set it as a high Dyess
level<00:01:08.280> first<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.270> de<00:01:09.450> am<00:01:09.630> scale

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
level first so we put on de am scale

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.850 
level first so we put on de am scale
there<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.659> here<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.900> two<00:01:12.990> dice<00:01:13.170> set<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
there and here we have two dice set to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
there and here we have two dice set to
you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.610> they're<00:01:14.790> under<00:01:16.159> starting<00:01:17.159> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you can see they're under starting on

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
you can see they're under starting on
the<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.490> hand<00:01:17.729> side<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.750> bottom

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the right hand side and the bottom

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
the right hand side and the bottom
symbol<00:01:19.409> under<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.740> hand<00:01:19.920> corner<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
symbol under right hand corner there is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.179 
symbol under right hand corner there is
is<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.830> egg<00:01:23.040> on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is that little you put a little egg on

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.929 
is that little you put a little egg on
the<00:01:23.310> left<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.490> stands<00:01:26.729> for

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the left of it and a and that stands for

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
the left of it and a and that stands for
micro<00:01:27.180> amps<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> millionth<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.710> amp

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
micro amps that's a millionth of an amp

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
micro amps that's a millionth of an amp
that's<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.579> ampere<00:01:29.939> divided<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> million

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's one ampere divided into a million

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
that's one ampere divided into a million
pieces

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pieces

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
pieces
and<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:33.540> small<00:01:34.500> amount<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and so you're very small amount of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.090 
and so you're very small amount of
current<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.420> other<00:01:36.770> microbes<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
current there other microbes are not a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
current there other microbes are not a
smallest<00:01:38.520> units<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.079> even

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
smallest units you can go down and even

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.020 
smallest units you can go down and even
even<00:01:41.070> lower<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:43.399> but<00:01:44.399> normally<00:01:44.880> 2

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
even lower than that and but normally 2

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
even lower than that and but normally 2
micro<00:01:45.360> amps<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.720> those<00:01:45.960> who<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
micro amps will be those who need to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.510 
micro amps will be those who need to
know<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.140> once<00:01:49.409> we've<00:01:49.770> made<00:01:50.159> meter

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
know about so then once we've made meter

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.810 
know about so then once we've made meter
set<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.280> will<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> expect<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> be

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
set to is is a will I expect to be

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
set to is is a will I expect to be
measuring<00:01:54.149> milliamps<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.020> you've<00:01:55.140> am<00:01:55.320> suppose

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
measuring milliamps so you've am suppose

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.920 
measuring milliamps so you've am suppose
amps<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> milliamps<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.780> see

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
amps and milliamps there and you can see

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.219 
amps and milliamps there and you can see
the<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.820> signature<00:01:59.820> mark<00:02:00.180> directly<00:02:00.930> over

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the little signature mark directly over

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.950 
the little signature mark directly over
the<00:02:01.350> MA<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> stands<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.240> alternating

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the MA and that stands for alternating

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
the MA and that stands for alternating
so<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:05.189> actually<00:02:05.369> measuring<00:02:05.700> direct

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so we're actually measuring direct

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
so we're actually measuring direct
current<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> case<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.700> see

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
current in this case and you can see

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.130 
current in this case and you can see
there<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.149> bear<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> three<00:02:09.959> little

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there little bear with the three little

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
there little bear with the three little
dots<00:02:10.319> underneath<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.610> yellow<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.450> the

and<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.239> want<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.780> measure<00:02:15.870> DC<00:02:16.500> that's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and when we want to measure DC that's

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.280 
and when we want to measure DC that's
the<00:02:17.010> DC<00:02:17.310> symbol<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.730> must<00:02:17.879> measure<00:02:18.060> DC<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:19.049> go

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the DC symbol we must measure DC just go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.869 
the DC symbol we must measure DC just go
over<00:02:19.349> here<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.069> yellow<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.549> moved<00:02:20.790> to

over here and that yellow was moved to

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.640 
over here and that yellow was moved to
press<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.080> what<00:02:22.230> Britt<00:02:22.409> debts

just well I just altered us to that it
doesn't<00:03:28.330> go<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> 0<00:03:29.620> completely<00:03:31.680> here<00:03:32.680> again

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.830 

all<00:03:56.160> right<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:57.270> check<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.510> see<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
all right just check to see what a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.080 
all right just check to see what a
minimun<00:03:58.260> was<00:04:01.100> too<00:04:02.100> many<00:04:02.220> military<00:04:02.640> Jericho's

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
minimun was too many military Jericho's

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.330 
minimun was too many military Jericho's
you<00:04:03.150> cut<00:04:03.300> out<00:04:03.420> completely<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.830> few<00:04:05.130> happened

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
you cut out completely so a few happened

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.140 
you cut out completely so a few happened
to<00:04:05.430> me<00:04:05.520> clear<00:04:05.760> wires<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.880> got<00:04:09.030> an

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
to me clear wires and and you got an

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.570 
to me clear wires and and you got an
open<00:04:09.420> circle<00:04:09.750> here<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.020> go<00:04:10.140> 2-0<00:04:10.320> lamps<00:04:10.890> so

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
open circle here to go 2-0 lamps so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.970 
open circle here to go 2-0 lamps so
that's<00:04:12.110> that's<00:04:13.110> again<00:04:13.380> that's<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> beauty<00:04:13.950> of

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
that's that's again that's the beauty of

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.009 
that's that's again that's the beauty of
this<00:04:14.190> setting<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.990> a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
this setting and you can see to a

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
minimum to record what it went 2-0 so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.940 
minimum to record what it went 2-0 so
you<00:04:18.060> know<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.540> had<00:04:18.660> an<00:04:18.810> open<00:04:18.900> circuit<00:04:21.950> so
