00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.170
 hello everyone how are you good at 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.959
 this video I wanted to show you a little something 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.340
 very simple but that the first thing that 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.050
 I usually do in summer 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.509
 when they are hot and when I leave the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.700
 shower and such eat wet hair I do it 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.829
 and I add some extensions for me 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.640
 longer and thicker the 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.079
 braid 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.989
 then I will show you how he placed 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.419
 the extensions like like me now 13 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.070
 as I still have the hairstyle I hope that 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.530
 you like I leave you with the good video 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 I got out of the shower and I have my hair 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.399
 wet then what I want is something 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.440
 fast and good that a little nice by 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.870
 that I put the extension to be a 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.989
 little bit longer then what I do 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.329
 is to make my line next to me 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.400
 fancy 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 this 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.650
 we make a line as we want or without 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.640
 stripes or ya 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.770
 to the taste of each 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.510
 and I was this but because it's wet it's going 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.010
 Get very gluey then when you go 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.600
 drying, it releases a little more 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.080
 but now in principle it was going to be 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.420
 so we throw it all in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.850
 one side to the side that we want to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.850
 go the braid I tell me to this one 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.780
 good to lengthen a little bit I'm going to 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.170
 use extensions of these clip 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.299
 one of one of a clip and another of two 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.100
 clips and the only thing I'm going to do well 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.710
 on motorcycles that have the same texture 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 wet that hair now and the only thing that 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.640
 I do is raise this area a little 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.740
 we put a clamp if we want and here 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.729
 I will hook them in any way 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 because you will not see 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.270
 we hooked one 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720
 and the other 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.990
 Once hooked when releasing the hair 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.570
 it has to stay above 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.720
 Covering everything well we comb again 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.780
 to join everything and now I'm going 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.010
 now we are going to do our good one 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.960
 Once we have the extensions already 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.270
 placed we are going to make the braid 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.670
 we can do whatever we want in this 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.850
 I'm not in a hurry, I 'm going to make a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.480
 normal of 3 ends but you can do the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.870
 spike of 4 ends or those who want 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.049
 now we do the normal braid and it is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.290
 and having the extensions like this is going to 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.739
 get much more chubby and also more 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.739
 long 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.269
 of jara and we can put a rubber like 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.470
 a flower if we want as I go 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.470
 yellow I'm going to put it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.129
 or we can put a more discreet one too 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.830
 Well, that's it, I would throw a 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.740
 little lacquer so that when the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.230
 hair I do not get too excited I 'm missing 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.550
 the earrings and also what I do is 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.830
 put behind him a little piece without 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.770
 look 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:42.060
 so that my hair does not fall off 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.959
 around here when it dries or so 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.959
 and hide it under 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.220
 so that this hair does not fall out when 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.600
 when it dries 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.400
 as I turned around I do not know if you saw it 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.910
 I hope so, but the clamp goes for 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 there behind tapadita and nothing more slowly 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.200
 would be ready is the allows depends something 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 a lot in summer because it's something of the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.980
 shower I propose and I go and good in 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.930
 winter I had it a little apart like this 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.850
 that now as the sun returned we return to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 take it out I hope you liked the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.680
 video and see you in the next video 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.680
 bye 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.920
 do not
