so a little kind of sample turned up

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.549 
so a little kind of sample turned up
it's<00:00:48.940> completely<00:00:49.090> correct<00:00:49.840> it's<00:00:50.020> exactly<00:00:50.470> how

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
it's completely correct it's exactly how

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.799 
it's completely correct it's exactly how
they're<00:00:50.710> going<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.949> be<00:00:51.070> but<00:00:51.879> we've<00:00:52.090> only<00:00:52.360> had

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
they're going to be but we've only had

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.200

this<00:00:53.020> pedal<00:00:53.410> for<00:00:53.620> about<00:00:53.890> five<00:00:54.520> minutes<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:55.030> try

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
this pedal for about five minutes to try

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.040 
this pedal for about five minutes to try
and<00:00:55.300> work<00:00:55.390> out<00:00:55.570> what<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.810> does

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
