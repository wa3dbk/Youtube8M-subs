 already won at the expense when I have you 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.010
 already won and in addition to him if he admits 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.600
 gave the 5 5 in five horses without any 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.910
 problem locution of entry marks 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.260
 of play we go back without a bad game of 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.360
 words in the arena directly with a 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 favorite all indicated the number 9 toreador 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.710
 he remains on two successes at this level 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.390
 it's the logic of placing m yes 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.340
 exactly me I really did it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 base because he's in very very big 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 form it stays as you come from the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.720
 say on two wins in the quintés 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.120
 so he is well known bettors his 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.010
 last race and victory it was on 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.570
 the 2100 meters of the big track 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.350
 he wins is really very very good 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.060
 before it was 2850 meters so it 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.370
 does a little bit everything is very regular 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 it's a very, very good commitment 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 head I think we can make him 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.050
 really trust it's a base 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.580
 especially I will add a small 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.890
 french thing -hunchbacked stone equivalent 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.770
 driver has won the last four 5.5 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.780
 which he participated in so well that's 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.190
 100% of the kidneys is revealing 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.770
 it means everything, so it makes sense to place 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.739
 in the lead in second position number 7 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.900
 beckmann 17 forgiveness is the revelation 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.670
 we are here it is the revelation of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
 this winter on vincennes 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.239
 undefeated in three attempts now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.070
 probably the reason why 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.940
 you had placed it in two setbacks of 25 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.680
 meters that's what worries you a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.450
 little bit yes a little bit indeed 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.130
 it's not going to be obvious in my opinion of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.160
 make 25 meters to horses I think 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.320
 quality in mind 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.510
 on the other hand as you said it is 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.690
 really blameless since we 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.430
 see running in France 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.440
 i think franck nivard will give him 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.570
 a very good course he will know the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.850
 actually bring back I read that he was 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.290
 not very very hot either the fact of 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.540
 make 25 meters one who was a small 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.220
 little but here they stay on three 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.790
 victories in vincennes he is deferré of 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.030
 four feet 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.580
 franck nivard fabrice souloy if I 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.960
 am obliged to agree in third 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.250
 position then damien blue does not have 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.190
 hidden as it was driving the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.590
 number 8 all organic and has just returned 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.940
 with success on this course it's 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.290
 also logical to keep in 3 same 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 why not in law finally he has his 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.300
 place on the podium 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.190
 yes yes here I think it is 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.560
 really inseparable from our favorite 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.360
 toreador they often ran one 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.910
 against each other so they are worth one 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.160
 little bit is the great shape too 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.750
 for the damian stable good who succeeds 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.880
 a lot during this meeting 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.820
 he just won on this course 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 it was him December that I'm doing 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.660
 also one of my favorites 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.400
 it will be almost a question of course 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.080
 to know who will prevail between these 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.070
 three days is the logic in 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.450
 fourth position 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.250
 there too a choice that could all 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.900
 also to win is number 7 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.190
 a crazy charm it stays on a 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.049
 excellent third place behind 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.820
 ultima of rib and a haufor love that's 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.890
 still not anyone on his 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.350
 launched deferré of 4 can not dismiss it 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.000
 that's why I keep it 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.020
 also the very powerful indeed without 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.290
 his shoes and more 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.290
 so there he is again déferré he 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.580
 just been third of the sly price 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.390
 finally here it comes to appear in 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 two groups 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.520
 I think that at this level if he reiterates 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.470
 his performances his place is in the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.790
 first five really agree in 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.140
 fifth position so maybe we will 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.070
 call it a little bit of poker 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.470
 may not be the horse of all the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.150
 world number three laughing torso he 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.550
 had shown ways early in the year 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.230
 he has just confirmed them 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.300
 this is the second asset of 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.040
 fabrice souloy at the beginning must be wary 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.110
 even so you have to be wary 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.720
 effect he has illustrated in groups 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.220
 in italy he has just been second in a 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.870
 love girl in the doynel price of 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.120
 saint quentin on this course 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.260
 so it was not anything it was 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.310
 a very good performance 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.270
 I think we have to remember him especially 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.710
 I'm going to add a little 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.240
 it's a horse that you are 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.770
 had said that was placed in Italy 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.050
 happened second of a group in 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.060
 italy 6 and that blocks him the road to 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.110
 a lot of events in France so that 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.550
 can be a goal 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.210
 we know fabrice souloy he emptied 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.570
 his commitments beckmann hockey orient 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.980
 torso 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.060
 we are wary because it could come 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.520
 quite make a couple with the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.040
 two islands and shoe this time but the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.230
 ferries has already established itself this way 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.620
 so we trust him we can not 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.540
 dismiss 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.440
 we will have understood ok him if I you 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.140
 request a small reminder of your 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.770
 selection is worth 8 so then my eight so 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.290
 the 9 toreador the 17 beckmann the 8 august 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.260
 the organic 7 a crazy charm 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.980
 the 3 orients Corsican and the last three 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.560

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.640
 we left on a 5 ch reduced by 3

 horses 3 absolute base 9 17 8 or will have 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.340
 understood by the way we placed the 3 on the 5th

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.719
 it's so rare that I was listening 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.400
 think everything is said or almost 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.139
 now it's a special show 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.860

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:38.189
