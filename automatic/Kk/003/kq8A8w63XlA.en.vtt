a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.090> boring<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:39.600> mean<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> sunday

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
a little boring i mean even the sunday

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.069 
a little boring i mean even the sunday

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
I mean it was still kind of black this

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
is probably going to come down to the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
is probably going to come down to the
bench<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:51.000> teams<00:00:51.629> bench<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.680> to
