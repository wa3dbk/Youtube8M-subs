e langston as Big E has done that move a
few<00:02:22.860> times<00:02:23.190> over<00:02:23.490> recent<00:02:23.790> years<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.540> looks<00:02:25.020> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
few times over recent years and looks to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.310

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
be a genuinely painful move so another

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.670 
be a genuinely painful move so another
potential<00:02:29.100> genuine<00:02:29.910> ng<00:02:30.420> moment<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.350> think

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
potential genuine ng moment but I think

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
potential genuine ng moment but I think
that<00:02:31.800> make<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.220> an<00:02:32.280> awesome<00:02:32.610> OMG<00:02:32.730> added<00:02:33.570> to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
know at 15 we did have a couple of these

again<00:03:02.100> done<00:03:02.460> from<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> full<00:03:02.880> position<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.600> I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
again done from the full position and I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.510 
again done from the full position and I
actually<00:03:04.170> think<00:03:04.620> these<00:03:04.860> were<00:03:05.040> some<00:03:05.310> pretty

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
actually think these were some pretty

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.240 
actually think these were some pretty
cool<00:03:05.850> smaller<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.540> 15<00:03:07.020> additions<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.130> think

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
cool smaller to 15 additions so I think

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.000 
cool smaller to 15 additions so I think
some<00:03:08.790> more<00:03:08.970> table<00:03:09.420> OMGs<00:03:09.960> similar<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.920> these

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
some more table OMGs similar to these

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.880 
some more table OMGs similar to these
four<00:03:11.190> tickets<00:03:11.460> 16<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.300> be<00:03:12.480> cool<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.050> since

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
potential brand new to get 16 oh gee

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.070 
potential brand new to get 16 oh gee
moment<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.130> Kevin<00:03:29.850> Owens<00:03:30.120> April<00:03:30.630> powerbomb

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
moment is Kevin Owens April powerbomb

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.870 
moment is Kevin Owens April powerbomb
and<00:03:31.470> now<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.830> think<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.220> what<00:03:32.489> would<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.760> up

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
and now I think this what would be up

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.760 
and now I think this what would be up
there<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:33.120> most<00:03:33.390> requested<00:03:33.900> energy<00:03:34.290> moments

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
there with most requested energy moments

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.710 
there with most requested energy moments
it's<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.520> pretty<00:03:35.760> sick<00:03:36.060> move<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.390> real<00:03:36.510> life

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
it's a pretty sick move in real life

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.840 
it's a pretty sick move in real life
therefore<00:03:37.470> would<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.770> pretty<00:03:38.160> sick<00:03:38.489> move<00:03:38.730> to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
therefore would be a pretty sick move to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.090 
therefore would be a pretty sick move to
happen<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> game<00:03:39.590> obviously<00:03:40.590> would<00:03:40.739> depend

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
happen the game obviously would depend

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580 
happen the game obviously would depend
on<00:03:41.340> Kevin<00:03:41.670> Owens<00:03:41.760> inclusion<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:43.110> if<00:03:43.230> Kevin

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
on Kevin Owens inclusion but if Kevin

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.199 
on Kevin Owens inclusion but if Kevin
Owens<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.220> game<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.700> hopefully<00:03:44.850> he

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
Owens is on the game and hopefully he

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.900 
Owens is on the game and hopefully he
will<00:03:45.360> be<00:03:45.420> his<00:03:46.320> eat<00:03:46.500> prepare<00:03:46.890> Obama<00:03:47.190> would<00:03:47.670> be<00:03:47.700> a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
will be his eat prepare Obama would be a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
will be his eat prepare Obama would be a
pretty<00:03:48.360> sick<00:03:48.660> inclusion<00:03:49.200> as<00:03:49.290> well<00:03:49.530> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
pretty sick inclusion as well so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.699 
pretty sick inclusion as well so
hopefully<00:03:50.670> if<00:03:50.850> Kevin<00:03:51.180> Owens<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.540> included<00:03:52.200> we

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
hopefully if Kevin Owens is included we

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.560 
hopefully if Kevin Owens is included we
may<00:03:52.890> potentially<00:03:53.250> have<00:03:53.640> an<00:03:53.910> apron<00:03:54.030> powerbomb

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
may potentially have an apron powerbomb

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.300 
may potentially have an apron powerbomb
as<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> brand<00:03:55.709> new<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:56.220> v16<00:03:56.910> OMG<00:03:57.420> moment<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.980> guys

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
as a brand new to v16 OMG moment so guys

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.880 
as a brand new to v16 OMG moment so guys
there<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.940> my<00:04:00.180> 5<00:04:00.510> energy<00:04:00.959> moments<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.650> would

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
there is my 5 energy moments I would

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.220 
there is my 5 energy moments I would
like<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.310> included<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.000> added<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.510> 2k16

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
like to see included and added the 2k16

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.410 
like to see included and added the 2k16
I<00:04:04.739> think<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.400> most<00:04:05.580> part<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.030> guys<00:04:06.180> would

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.729 
I think for the most part you guys would
agree<00:04:06.660> with<00:04:06.780> me<00:04:06.989> they<00:04:07.200> will<00:04:07.350> make<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.680> a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
agree with me they will make this a

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.640 
agree with me they will make this a
pretty<00:04:08.040> cool<00:04:08.370> brand<00:04:08.790> new<00:04:08.910> energy<00:04:09.269> moments<00:04:09.780> but

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
pretty cool brand new energy moments but

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.710 
pretty cool brand new energy moments but
