00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.680

there's<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:24.930> couple<00:05:25.110> flaws<00:05:25.469> with<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:26.340> it

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
there's a couple flaws with it but it

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.540 
there's a couple flaws with it but it
definitely<00:05:27.690> looks<00:05:28.349> better<00:05:28.500> this<00:05:29.070> time<00:05:29.130> I

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
definitely looks better this time I

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.379 
definitely looks better this time I
think<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.180> my<00:05:30.389> opinion<00:05:30.419> at<00:05:30.930> least<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.699> can

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
think in my opinion at least so I can

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.120 
think in my opinion at least so I can
see<00:05:33.539> its<00:05:33.659> face<00:05:33.750> paint<00:05:34.289> instead<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.740> mask<00:05:34.979> so

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
see its face paint instead of a mask so

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.470 
see its face paint instead of a mask so
I'll<00:05:35.340> get<00:05:35.490> into<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.760> in<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.060> second

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
I'll get into that in a second

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.600

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
it's a little bit uh it looks kind of

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.630 
it's a little bit uh it looks kind of
cool<00:06:33.120> i<00:06:33.180> think<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:34.890> don't<00:06:35.160> have<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.610> have

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
cool i think and you don't have to have

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.110 
cool i think and you don't have to have
the<00:06:36.030> problem<00:06:36.510> of<00:06:36.690> having<00:06:37.500> using<00:06:38.190> that<00:06:38.310> mask

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
the problem of having using that mask

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.800 
the problem of having using that mask
and<00:06:39.450> hat<00:06:40.050> glitch<00:06:40.410> and<00:06:40.790> having<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:41.880> mask<00:06:42.120> merge

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
and hat glitch and having the mask merge

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.960 
and hat glitch and having the mask merge
through<00:06:43.200> the<00:06:43.320> hat<00:06:43.500> so<00:06:44.160> that's<00:06:44.430> why<00:06:44.580> i<00:06:44.610> chose<00:06:44.790> to

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
through the hat so that's why i chose to

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.240 
through the hat so that's why i chose to
do<00:06:45.060> this<00:06:45.210> and<00:06:45.450> I<00:06:45.510> think<00:06:45.570> it<00:06:45.750> looks<00:06:45.870> pretty<00:06:45.930> cool

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
do this and I think it looks pretty cool

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.890 
do this and I think it looks pretty cool
i'll<00:06:47.250> show<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.520> a<00:06:47.610> picture<00:06:48.060> next<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.570> it<00:06:48.690> it's

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
i'll show you a picture next to it it's

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.280 
i'll show you a picture next to it it's
not<00:06:49.080> exactly<00:06:49.880> similar<00:06:50.880> because<00:06:51.570> the<00:06:52.170> original

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
not exactly similar because the original

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.940 
not exactly similar because the original
or<00:06:52.980> the<00:06:53.310> actual<00:06:53.490> watchmen<00:06:54.360> outfit<00:06:55.320> is<00:06:55.500> based

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
or the actual watchmen outfit is based

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.100 
or the actual watchmen outfit is based
off<00:06:56.160> of<00:06:56.220> brown<00:06:56.670> but<00:06:56.910> we<00:06:56.970> don't<00:06:57.150> have<00:06:57.210> brown

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
off of brown but we don't have brown

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.930 
off of brown but we don't have brown
trench<00:06:58.530> coats<00:06:58.770> or<00:06:58.920> anything<00:06:59.280> like<00:06:59.310> that<00:06:59.460> so

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
trench coats or anything like that so

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.220 
trench coats or anything like that so
basically<00:07:00.120> i<00:07:00.390> did<00:07:00.540> this<00:07:00.690> and<00:07:00.930> I<00:07:00.990> think<00:07:01.140> it's

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
basically i did this and I think it's

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.530 
basically i did this and I think it's
pretty<00:07:01.410> cool<00:07:01.680> the<00:07:02.340> way<00:07:02.370> the<00:07:02.490> character<00:07:03.180> stands

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
pretty cool the way the character stands

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.140 
pretty cool the way the character stands
he<00:07:03.810> looks<00:07:04.080> like<00:07:04.200> a<00:07:04.260> murderer<00:07:04.680> now<00:07:04.980> they've<00:07:05.940> got

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
he looks like a murderer now they've got

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.300 
he looks like a murderer now they've got
this<00:07:06.300> new<00:07:06.570> I<00:07:06.870> don't<00:07:07.560> know<00:07:07.770> if<00:07:07.890> anybody<00:07:08.190> else

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
this new I don't know if anybody else

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.500 
this new I don't know if anybody else
noticed<00:07:08.670> this<00:07:08.790> but<00:07:08.970> when<00:07:09.090> you<00:07:09.180> wear<00:07:09.330> these
