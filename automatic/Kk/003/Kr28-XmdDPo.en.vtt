00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.969 
give her her treat now it might seem
kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> silly<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> teach<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.439> cat<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.829> touch

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
kind of silly to teach your cat to touch

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.380 
kind of silly to teach your cat to touch
your<00:01:38.159> finger<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.549> mean<00:01:38.729> after<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
your finger I mean after all a lot of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
your finger I mean after all a lot of
them<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> naturally<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
them do that naturally but that's the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
them do that naturally but that's the
reason<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.610> start<00:01:41.850> work<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> basic

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
reason we start work on that as a basic

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
reason we start work on that as a basic
tool<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> try<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.090> teach<00:01:45.299> your

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
tool because if you try to teach your

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
tool because if you try to teach your
cat<00:01:45.570> something<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.259> normal<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.649> them

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
cat something that's not normal for them

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.109 
cat something that's not normal for them
it's<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> take<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> longer<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it's going to take you longer and be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's going to take you longer and be
confusing<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> cat<00:01:48.899> whereas<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.009> one

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
confusing for the cat whereas this one

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
confusing for the cat whereas this one
is<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> normal<00:01:50.850> cue<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.299> many<00:01:51.540> cats<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:52.020> learn

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
is a normal cue that many cats can learn

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
is a normal cue that many cats can learn
relatively<00:01:52.649> quickly<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.939> use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
relatively quickly and that you can use

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.460 
relatively quickly and that you can use
for<00:01:54.299> behavior<00:01:54.600> modification<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.140> training

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
for behavior modification and training

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
for behavior modification and training
later<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:56.969> teach<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.299> cat

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
later and that's how you teach your cat

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
later and that's how you teach your cat
to<00:01:57.630> touch
