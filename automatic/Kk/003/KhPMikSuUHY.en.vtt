or<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> try<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.120> know

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
or so you think as you try and you know

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
or so you think as you try and you know
go<00:01:01.050> through<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.410> pipe<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.829> actually<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
go through that pipe but actually if you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
go through that pipe but actually if you
break<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
break that one right down there so you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
break that one right down there so you
need<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.670> Nia<00:01:05.670> make<00:01:05.850> sure<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> keep

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
need to have them Nia make sure you keep

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.490 
need to have them Nia make sure you keep
a<00:01:06.330> mushroom<00:01:06.720> otherwise<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.170> won't<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.439> able
