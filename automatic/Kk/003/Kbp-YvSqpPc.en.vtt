 we will see the groups and analyze equipment 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 per team the groups are conformed 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.350
 by the host in the group a would be 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 chile mexico ecuador bolivia in the group 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.449
 go to the head is argentina uruguay 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 paraguay jamaica and in the group c what 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.039
 head brasil colombia peru and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.260
 venezuela we will start analyzing the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.359
 host chile plays at home what 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.399
 gives you an advantage with a very good 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.890
 team with players that excel at 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.989
 mean they have a very offensive game where 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 they have alexis sanchez a player 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 very fast and skillful weaknesses chile 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 he has a terrible defense and his central 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 they are the shortest of the height of the cup 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 they do not have an area 9 and they have a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 excellent creation flyer but in a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 bad physical condition classified it with a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.260
 7 out of 10 and my prediction absolutely 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 staff is that it will end in the third 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 place of the cup mexico always comes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.829
 with the team go to the cup so no 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 will give a lot to analyze in the cup of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 world- exhibited a more collective game 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.100
 and defensive with replacement players 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.710
 in your selection 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.930
 4 out of 10 Ecuador has a very strong team 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.120
 fast has very good flyers is the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 València case weaknesses are created 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.560
 many chances of goal but concrete 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
 very little his defense is limited and what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 ranked with a 5 of 10 Bolivian 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.940
 ranked the brazil-2014 world cup made 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.160
 a very poor tie has not had 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.050
 a replacement in your selection the last 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.090
 matches has shown a pretty game 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.720
 defensive taking advantage of the counterattack 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 has martins a very good forward 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 ranking 4 of 10 argentina was 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.260
 finalist in the world cup brazil 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.000
 2014 has an excellent team 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.160
 full of stars and has some of the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.930
 best players in the world without hesitation 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.620
 candidate for the cup final 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 America 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.370
 problems the team manages messi that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.870
 try to play like the barcelona being 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.240
 that the team does not have the same 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
 qualities its greatest virtue is its greatest 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
 problem if messi lets martino do 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 a team taking advantage of the virtues of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 your players will possibly be champion 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.630
 if it did not stay again in the second 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 place 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.910
 classification 9 out of 10 uruguay always gives 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.040
 of speaking in this tournament did not do a very 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.409
 good world cup has a team 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.689
 strong and an excellent defense has to 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.239
 World class strikers like Cavani 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.640
 and Suarez weaknesses lack of flyers and 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.680
 creators in the midfield still it is 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 difficult to classify uruguay what 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.299
 ranked with a 7 out of 10 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.069
 paraguay made a very bad elimination 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.870
 missing a replacement in your selection has 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.120
 lost his game identity account 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.879
 always with good center forwards 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 9 does not give much to analyze in advance 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.349
 a change is expected in the American Cup 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.810
 he classified it with a 4 out of 10 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.970
 hamaika good of this team I do not know much 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.040
 review some videos and I could see that they are 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.349
 fast but they do not have technique play 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.359
 very disordered my classification for 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.790
 they are 3 out of 10 and they would be cheese 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.489
 of the Brazil group made a terrible global 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.650
 being that he owned the house he was thrashed 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.629
 and humiliated but changed from coach to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.269
 the arrival of dunga cup champion 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.250
 america of venezuela the 2007 won the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.049
 final to Argentina by 3 to 0 with a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.900
 cataloged team as you see is a 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.340
 coach who believes more in the tactical 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.409
 strategic that technically goes to stop 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.569
 a very strong team probably and it 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.550
 sum to the candidates to win the cup 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.280
 together with argentina its greater 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.550
 neymar weaknesses lack of strikers 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
 of area classification 8 of 10 colombia 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.570
 he made a good playoff and good 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.460
 world has players like james 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.710
 rodríguez and falcao has an excellent 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.990
 midfield has a very good 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
 coach that is pekerman weaknesses 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.760
 has a very slow defense do not mark 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.680
 very good overconfidence falcao no 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.930
 is going through a good moment my 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.670
 classification for Colombia is 7 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.680
 10 and it would be within four 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 best of the cup Peru has 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.730
 several good players is the case of 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.740
 Vargas and Pizarro had a bad 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.170
 eliminator are still found 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.820
 looking for a game scheme does not give much 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.730
 to talk because it depends a lot on 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.250
 individualities classification 3 of 10 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 venezuela has made this tournament a 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.150
 surprise in the last editions to 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.460
 coach change what he has shown 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.200
 venezuela in friendlies is that he has lost 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.270
 much of his defensive game and that 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.670
 involved many balls stopped like 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.620
 Caesar farías took advantage of it to the 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.750
 selection of venezuela in this cup 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.670
 I give it 3 out of 10 well that would be my 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.460
 analysis by team my predictions 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.240
 would be first brazil second argentina 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.340
 third 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.830
 and fourth Colombia but as Brazil 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.539
 good favorite brazil comes to rebound 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.759
 how bad it happened in the world cup 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.500
 the game change that you will have with 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.050
 dunga will make it a very strong team 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.880
 especially in South America all this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.660
 said in football you can not predict 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.580
 nothing able to leave champion jamaica 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.120
 jajajajaja hehe xd comment you your 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.120
