00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.990 
thing that I'm doing right now but
instead<00:01:50.939> mark<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.899> line<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> pen<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.700> any

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
instead mark a line with a pen or any

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
instead mark a line with a pen or any
marking<00:01:54.810> tool<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.409> use<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.649> scissors

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
marking tool and then use your scissors

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
marking tool and then use your scissors
very<00:01:56.579> carefully<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> rotary

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
very carefully but if you have a rotary

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
very carefully but if you have a rotary
cutter<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.790> cut

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
cutter you can pretty much cut

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
cutter you can pretty much cut

everything the way that you want it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
everything the way that you want it
without<00:02:01.979> stress<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:03.930> people

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
without stress like you know how people

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
without stress like you know how people
go<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> pizza<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> cut<00:02:06.390> your

pizza with a pair of scissors nah so

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.460 
pizza with a pair of scissors nah so
it's<00:02:09.820> really<00:02:10.150> convenient<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.990> have<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> rotary

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
it's really convenient to have a rotary

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's really convenient to have a rotary
cutter<00:02:11.650> if<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:12.820> not<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.480> can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
cutter if you can get one if not you can

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.540 
cutter if you can get one if not you can

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
scissors nothing wrong with that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.840 
scissors nothing wrong with that
so<00:02:19.750> after<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> v-cut<00:02:20.650> was<00:02:20.890> made<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.490> flipped

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
so after the v-cut was made I flipped

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.210 
so after the v-cut was made I flipped
the<00:02:21.970> flannel<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.900> inside<00:02:23.320> was<00:02:23.740> showing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the flannel so the inside was showing

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.670 
the flannel so the inside was showing
and<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.580> started<00:02:24.970> hemming<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> raw<00:02:25.780> edges<00:02:26.110> made

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and I started hemming the raw edges made

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.550 
and I started hemming the raw edges made
from<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> v-cut<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.480> you've<00:02:28.690> never<00:02:28.720> sewn

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
from the v-cut now if you've never sewn

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.010 
from the v-cut now if you've never sewn
on<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> zipper<00:02:30.430> or<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.330> know<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> V

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
on a zipper or you don't know what a V

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
want if you're on mobile I'll probably

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.870 
want if you're on mobile I'll probably
put<00:02:40.600> an<00:02:40.720> annotation<00:02:40.990> slash<00:02:41.620> card<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.520> after

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
put an annotation slash card so after

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.940 
put an annotation slash card so after
I've<00:02:43.150> made<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> V<00:02:44.050> cut<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.500> flipped<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I've made the V cut I flipped the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.520 
I've made the V cut I flipped the
flannel<00:02:45.370> onto<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> inside<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.960> decided<00:02:47.440> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
flannel onto the inside and I decided to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580 
flannel onto the inside and I decided to
start<00:02:48.040> folding<00:02:48.970> all<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.570> raw<00:02:49.780> edges<00:02:49.990> because

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
start folding all the raw edges because

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.800 
start folding all the raw edges because
raw<00:02:50.830> edges<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.640> fun<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.270> work<00:02:52.480> with

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
raw edges are not fun to work with

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.230 
raw edges are not fun to work with
so<00:02:53.440> folding<00:02:53.830> them<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.160> onto<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.610> inside<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
so folding them in onto the inside of

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.580 
so folding them in onto the inside of
the<00:02:55.360> flannel<00:02:55.810> they're<00:02:55.990> gonna<00:02:56.080> be<00:02:56.230> covered

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the flannel they're gonna be covered

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.080 
the flannel they're gonna be covered
with<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.010> zippers<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.670> don't<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.000> to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
with the zippers so you don't have to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.490 
with the zippers so you don't have to
worry<00:02:58.270> about<00:02:58.360> double<00:02:58.840> folding<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.320> anything

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
worry about double folding or anything

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.190 
worry about double folding or anything
like<00:02:59.740> that's<00:03:00.180> after<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.540> hemming<00:03:01.960> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
like that's after all the hemming and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.260 
like that's after all the hemming and
ironing<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.890> flipped<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.580> flannel<00:03:03.940> onto<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
ironing I flipped the flannel onto the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.990 
ironing I flipped the flannel onto the
right<00:03:04.510> side<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.680> flannel<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.550> really

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
right side of the flannel that's really

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
right side of the flannel that's really
weirdly<00:03:07.330> worded<00:03:08.050> by<00:03:08.590> flipping<00:03:08.890> onto<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
weirdly worded by flipping onto the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.130 
weirdly worded by flipping onto the
right<00:03:09.520> side<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.910> flannel<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.450> open<00:03:11.020> up

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
right side of the flannel and open up

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.770 
right side of the flannel and open up
the<00:03:11.530> slit<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.310> should<00:03:12.490> be<00:03:12.580> nice<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.820> clean<00:03:13.300> so

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
the slit it should be nice and clean so

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.080 
the slit it should be nice and clean so
I<00:03:13.840> grabbed<00:03:14.320> my<00:03:14.470> zipper<00:03:14.860> unzips<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.940> it's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
I grabbed my zipper unzips it so it's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.960 
I grabbed my zipper unzips it so it's
easier<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.570> sew<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.470> each<00:03:17.830> side<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.580> slit

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
easier to sew on each side of the slit

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.900 
easier to sew on each side of the slit
and<00:03:19.270> use<00:03:19.930> pins<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.440> keep<00:03:20.590> everything<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.280> place

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
and use pins to keep everything in place

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.030 
and use pins to keep everything in place
so<00:03:22.330> today<00:03:22.840> for<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.260> transformation<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
so today for this transformation I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.530
