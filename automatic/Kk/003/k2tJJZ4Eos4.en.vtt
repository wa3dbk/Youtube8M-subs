that actually looks like dropouts but

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.150 
that actually looks like dropouts but
they're<00:03:02.350> really<00:03:02.530> not

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
they're really not

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.960 
they're really not
so<00:03:03.910> let<00:03:04.120> me<00:03:04.150> explain<00:03:05.459> we're<00:03:06.459> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.760> out

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
so let me explain we're going to go out

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.320 
so let me explain we're going to go out
of<00:03:07.000> here<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.600> have<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.440> stop<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.980> one<00:03:09.330> and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
of here and have to stop this one and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.460 
of here and have to stop this one and
I'm<00:03:10.480> going<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.690> go<00:03:10.840> into<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.350> laps<00:03:11.560> goat<00:03:13.470> I've

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I'm going to go into the laps goat I've

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.229 
I'm going to go into the laps goat I've
already<00:03:14.739> got<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.070> let's<00:03:15.430> don't<00:03:15.760> set<00:03:16.030> up

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
already got this let's don't set up

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.500 
already got this let's don't set up
we're<00:03:17.230> going<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> turn<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.860> on

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.960 

and<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.650> playing<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.129> this<00:03:22.430> I'm<00:03:22.670> still

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
and it's playing like this I'm still

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.119 
and it's playing like this I'm still
setting<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.540> five<00:03:23.810> seconds<00:03:24.409> just<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:24.799> the

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
setting in five seconds just like the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.610 
setting in five seconds just like the
other<00:03:25.310> one<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.269> now<00:03:26.450> we're<00:03:26.750> reading<00:03:26.930> voltage

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
other one and now we're reading voltage

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.890 
other one and now we're reading voltage
over<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.310> we're<00:03:28.610> not<00:03:28.760> reading<00:03:29.030> frequency

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
over here we're not reading frequency

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.380 
over here we're not reading frequency
and<00:03:30.379> if<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.190> look<00:03:31.370> at<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.640> voltage<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.239> you

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and if you look at the voltage if you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.509 
and if you look at the voltage if you
look<00:03:32.569> close<00:03:32.840> zero<00:03:33.530> volts<00:03:33.890> is<00:03:34.010> right<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.400> the

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
look close zero volts is right in the

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.030 
look close zero volts is right in the
middle<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.629> going<00:03:35.900> up<00:03:36.049> over<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.590> Walter

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
middle and it's going up over to Walter

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.830 
middle and it's going up over to Walter
that's<00:03:37.160> going<00:03:37.430> down<00:03:37.549> below<00:03:38.120> negative<00:03:38.660> two

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
that's going down below negative two

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.949 
that's going down below negative two
volts<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.700> sine<00:03:41.030> wave<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:41.870> it

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
volts so this is the sine wave that it

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.920 
volts so this is the sine wave that it
was<00:03:42.080> talking<00:03:42.560> about<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:43.670> see<00:03:43.879> that<00:03:44.060> better<00:03:44.330> I'm

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
was talking about to see that better I'm

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.619 
was talking about to see that better I'm
going<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.170> change<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.769> sweep<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.489> go<00:03:47.420> from

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
going to change the sweep and go from

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.949 
going to change the sweep and go from
five<00:03:47.989> seconds<00:03:48.790> what<00:03:49.790> we're<00:03:49.940> at<00:03:50.090> let's<00:03:50.599> go<00:03:50.750> down

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
five seconds what we're at let's go down

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.869 
five seconds what we're at let's go down
five<00:03:51.500> seconds<00:03:52.040> five<00:03:53.030> milliseconds

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.490 

now<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:59.120> can<00:03:59.300> see<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.690> sine<00:03:59.930> wave<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.260> little

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
now you can see the sine wave a little

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.000 
now you can see the sine wave a little
bit<00:04:00.769> better

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.070 

sorry<00:04:07.550> waiting

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.809 

both<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.920> over

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.759 

or<00:04:15.120> five<00:04:15.329> milliseconds<00:04:16.079> now

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
or five milliseconds now

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.400 
or five milliseconds now
accelerate

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.220 

to<00:04:25.560> see<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.920> voltage<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.820> up<00:04:27.230> the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
to see the voltage is going up the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.580 
to see the voltage is going up the
frequency<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.160> not<00:04:29.430> up<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.030> down<00:04:30.590> frequency

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
frequency is not up and down frequency

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.720 
frequency is not up and down frequency
is<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.860> interval<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.520> between<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.250> when<00:04:35.700> I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
is the interval in between so when I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.220 
is the interval in between so when I
accelerate<00:04:36.420> our<00:04:36.690> voltage<00:04:37.080> does<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.620> up<00:04:39.200> go<00:04:40.200> up

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
accelerate our voltage does go up go up

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.920 
accelerate our voltage does go up go up
and<00:04:40.530> down<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.040> sunny<00:04:41.310> way<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:42.330> also<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
and down in a sunny way but also the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.140 
and down in a sunny way but also the
frequency<00:04:43.560> gets<00:04:43.770> shorter

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.230 

so<00:04:51.900> as<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.199> look<00:04:52.410> at<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.889> there<00:04:53.729> are<00:04:53.940> no

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
so as you look at this there are no

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.590 
so as you look at this there are no
dropouts<00:04:55.280> we're<00:04:56.280> going<00:04:56.639> clearly<00:04:57.090> above<00:04:57.360> them

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
dropouts we're going clearly above them

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.780 
dropouts we're going clearly above them
below<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.229> in<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.800> state<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.160> nice<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.669> even

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.570 

there<00:05:06.790> are<00:05:06.940> no<00:05:07.150> drop<00:05:07.480> out<00:05:08.370> because<00:05:09.370> it's

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
there are no drop out because it's

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.410 
there are no drop out because it's
generating<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.450> sine<00:05:10.810> wave<00:05:11.850> now<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.270> make

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
generating a sine wave now this to make

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.730 
generating a sine wave now this to make
understand<00:05:14.350> that<00:05:14.590> let's<00:05:14.950> go<00:05:15.100> back<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:17.590> our

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
understand that let's go back to our

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.730 
understand that let's go back to our
component<00:05:18.370> test<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:18.970> then<00:05:19.630> here<00:05:20.110> it's<00:05:20.560> a

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
component test and then here it's a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.429 
component test and then here it's a
frequency<00:05:21.400> kiss<00:05:21.690> when<00:05:22.690> we<00:05:22.840> start<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.470> meter

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.329 

we're<00:05:28.009> eating<00:05:28.309> 1.5<00:05:29.119> the<00:05:29.419> frequency<00:05:30.159> and<00:05:31.159> it

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
we're eating 1.5 the frequency and it

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.239 
we're eating 1.5 the frequency and it
goes<00:05:31.519> the<00:05:32.509> frequency<00:05:33.199> goes<00:05:33.229> up<00:05:33.499> that's<00:05:34.099> the

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:34.249 
goes the frequency goes up that's the

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.159 
goes the frequency goes up that's the
same<00:05:34.519> thing<00:05:34.729> on<00:05:34.939> the<00:05:35.059> other<00:05:35.089> one<00:05:35.389> where<00:05:36.050> it

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
same thing on the other one where it

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.769 
same thing on the other one where it
goes<00:05:36.499> together<00:05:36.800> but<00:05:37.759> here<00:05:38.029> it<00:05:38.089> is<00:05:38.209> displaying

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
goes together but here it is displaying

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.829 
goes together but here it is displaying
the<00:05:38.899> frequency<00:05:39.649> increasing<00:05:40.539> where<00:05:41.539> when<00:05:41.719> you

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
the frequency increasing where when you

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.019 
the frequency increasing where when you
were<00:05:41.959> looking<00:05:42.259> at<00:05:42.379> voltage<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:43.519> was<00:05:43.669> actually

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
were looking at voltage it was actually

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.540 
were looking at voltage it was actually
screaming<00:05:44.569> together

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.110 

so<00:05:48.729> these<00:05:48.879> are<00:05:49.090> not<00:05:49.330> found<00:05:49.900> in<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.319> year

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
so these are not found in the year

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.210 
so these are not found in the year
not<00:05:51.510> reading<00:05:51.930> you

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
not reading you

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.670 
not reading you
up<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:55.400> down<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.570> having<00:05:56.810> this<00:05:57.080> equipment

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680

we want to find the evidence they
actually<00:06:11.900> tells<00:06:12.140> us<00:06:12.290> what<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.620> problem<00:06:12.980> is

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
actually tells us what the problem is

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.460 
actually tells us what the problem is
when<00:06:13.820> you're<00:06:13.940> gathering<00:06:14.210> data<00:06:14.780> it's<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.200> same

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
when you're gathering data it's the same

way gather the evidence in the data and

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.290 
way gather the evidence in the data and
be<00:06:18.410> sure<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.770> understand<00:06:19.310> what<00:06:19.910> if<00:06:20.030> telling

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
so as you advance and get a high-tech

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.130 
so as you advance and get a high-tech
piece<00:06:34.010> of<00:06:34.250> equipment<00:06:34.760> you<00:06:35.540> need<00:06:35.690> to<00:06:35.810> become<00:06:36.110> a

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
piece of equipment you need to become a

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.890 
piece of equipment you need to become a
high<00:06:36.380> tech<00:06:36.650> technician<00:06:37.340> as<00:06:37.460> well<00:06:37.760> and<00:06:38.330> expand

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900
