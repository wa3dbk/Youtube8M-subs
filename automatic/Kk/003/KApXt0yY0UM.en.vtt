00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 and then staff okay good this video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.400
 a video of indication of the north of the channel 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 90 if you want to know channel 90 is only 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.849
 click here under 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 in the video description of cleaning the channel 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.949
 it is north and they make a nostalgia 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.020
 than it was in the 1990s. 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.240
 games and movies and a lot of stuff there 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.279
 league that's worth it 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 well he pointed me to a video of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.070
 five games that marked the childhood already 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.529
 do not be 15 best games of my 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 childhood or the legal 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.700
 Truth to do this, I'll stay here. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 one hour talking to you but five 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.550
 games that marked the times in my 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 childhood 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 So it's not that they are the best and such 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 but those who marked then do not go 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.219
 first game is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.309
 the first game was a trap for 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.739
 roger rabbit of the nintendo nintendo ds 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.530
 8 bits I did not have a phantom system on 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 time I won there with my 12 13 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 years it was the phantom system was 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.070
 produced by the gradient was a 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.930
 Brazilian production and that you could 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 play the games of my understanding of 8 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.049
 bits a trap for roger rabbit one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.540
 film released in the year 1988 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 mixed up lively defense with people 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.000
 real 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 good movie was such a success that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
 nintendo decided to launch the game 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.430
 based on the movie you control in the game 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.689
 Detective is flawed and the roger always 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.909
 stand behind you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.000
 Wherever you go you control 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.310
 also the taxi that same taxi from the movie 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 the goal was simple to find four 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.729
 parts of a will to power 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.439
 south africa 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.450
 the buildings were very similar to you 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.500
 pull over to the enemy at least once 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 You'd already have lost a good life. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.640
 finding the dynamite and a detonator 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
 You move to the drawing side. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 animated to a world of designs 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.060
 which is very similar to the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.159
 everything you 've been playing before 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 you keep looking for items and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.570
 looking for the parts of the will and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 persecuted by the henchmen of the judge who 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.329
 try to trap rock and take a life of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 you 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.970
 but the game itself is pretty cool the second 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.920
 game was super mario super mÃ¡rio nem 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.930
 You need to talk to people, super Mario. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 marked the childhood of many people since 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.239
 the nine years until the youngest 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.950
 all games by landmark so the super 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.200
 8-bit nintendo mario I think 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.989
 is a classic that everyone plays and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.150
 finally it is impossible to speak of an old 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.750
 not to mention the most famous plumber in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 world 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.540
 super Mario Gobbi was released by 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.670
 Nintendo in 1985 and to this day makes 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.239
 success in several generations 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.489
 in 1993 tried to make the film in 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.010
 super mario brothers movie really 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.220
 was super mario brothers people and so the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.090
 movie does not have much to do with the game and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.510
 left much to be desired came the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.850
 third game is the lion king who scored the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.920
 Lion King's childhood and super nintendo 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.480
 was a time that traveled to Brasilia 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.090
 to stay with relatives with uncles 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.220
 with the cousins we would play day and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.269
 night area was very cool and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.790
 we managed to generate together in 1994 the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.519
 Unlinking 32nd movie feature film 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.280
 cartoon and the ninth largest box office 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 of the history of the cinema or region 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.350
 well I do not even need to talk about this much 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.650
 movie because the movie is wonderful 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.989
 nintendo and sega have released the game with 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.049
 their respective consonant the super 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.810
 nintendo and also for the mega drive 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.380
 good you go controlling the simba through 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.590
 the soundtrack of the game is 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.099
 perfect 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.130
 sensational very true to the movie 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.560
 good this phase the stage hakuna matata where 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.669
 You have to keep jumping from branch to branch. 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.739
 twig and giraffe head and e 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.989
 fleeing to the monkeys to put these 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.890
 monkeys in order and be played by end 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.900
 of the phase 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.660
 good ahead you play with five 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.690
 adults and in the end you fight against your 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.780
 Uncle Scar wins and returns to the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.780
 Kingdom 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.670
 The fourth game was to try hughes ninja 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.070
 also does not understand 8 bits is to make the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.959
 that generates a horrible game, it's a game 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.280
 too bad it was very difficult but I 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.220
 I really liked it because that was what 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.730
 had to play who had childhood in 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.640
 in the 80's and in the 90's certainly felt 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.180
 quite the drawings and films of the 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 ninja tortoises and nintendo 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.050
 taking advantage of this success solved 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.230
 to cast to 8-bit NINTENDO 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.180
 The Ninja Turtles Game The Game Was 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.570
 until cool the graphics were up 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.090
 cool scraps and the advantage was power 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.669
 change character in mid-game 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 even before the final phase you had 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.440
 tired of playing with the character I 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.980
 had a life of his very low she just 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.320
 It gives fauzi to choose another turtle the 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.590
 level of difficulty of the game and is 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.020
 average to difficult some well phases passes 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.080
 to pass but in the majority of medium to 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.900
 difficult because they were already very good and 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.810
 complicated to kill but all had 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.990
 that lard you used to explain in the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.260
 cantinho or throwing stars power 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.110
 spend more guarantee hours of fun 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.020
 the fifth game because it is a dalit of ps 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.430
 super nintendo is and the game was very 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.280
 cool, it's been a very good time for me 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.800
 because at the time my father did not want 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.120
 let him learn English because he said 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.890
 that English did not give the future 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.630
 no one in fact english ever gave 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.120
 in this English good was never essential 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.740
 to no one he as a very wise person 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.980
 He said that the English did not give the future to 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.960
 me 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.210
 and I was not going to put me in English school 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.470
 did not want to put me on and what I did 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.350
 To learn english 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.900
 I copied all the lines I saw 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.730
 written during the game and had two 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.190
 dictionaries there on the English bookshelf 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.230
 Portuguese Portuguese English and I passed 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.240
 the game spent time playing and 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.770
 translated and from there I was able to 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.450
 a little English 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.090
 So if a game that marked me because 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.210
 It was my beginning to discover another 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.110
 tongue and giving slab in the sky of the 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.980
 ipea 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.050
 the game launched in 1991 for the 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.970
 super nintendo and came to sell around 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.890
 of 4 million copies 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.830
 in it you controlled the character 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.860
 called a little boy link and draw a 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.230
 Very cool very cool map full of 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.390
 enemies and full of cloths to be 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.970
 solved some places you just 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.880
 I would get it right after I got 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.400
 I liked the game items very much. 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.640
 dialogues and I ended up learning English 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.230
 cause of that game and if there were five games 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.730
 that marked the childhood 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.890
