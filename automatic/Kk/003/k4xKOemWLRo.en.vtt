the<00:01:21.600> grafting<00:01:22.140> we're<00:01:22.350> doing<00:01:22.649> today<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:24.329> is

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the grafting we're doing today this is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.529 
the grafting we're doing today this is
2015<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> 2014<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.390> much

2015 this is 2014 you can see how much

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.740 
2015 this is 2014 you can see how much
they<00:01:30.750> grew<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.310> they<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.819> mistake<00:01:33.390> they

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
they grew and they have a mistake they

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.020 
they grew and they have a mistake they
nail<00:01:34.289> that<00:01:34.500> laugh<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.069> there<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.459> tie<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
nail that laugh in there and tie the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.029 
nail that laugh in there and tie the
limbs<00:01:36.359> to<00:01:36.600> him<00:01:36.719> so<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.049> wind<00:01:37.229> does<00:01:37.469> not<00:01:37.500> brush

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
limbs to him so the wind does not brush

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.770 
limbs to him so the wind does not brush
them<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:39.229> also<00:01:40.229> they're<00:01:40.829> training<00:01:41.780> their

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
them out also they're training their

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
them out also they're training their
scaffolds<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:44.609> I'm<00:01:44.729> cutting<00:01:45.119> these

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
scaffolds and when I'm cutting these

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.440 
scaffolds and when I'm cutting these
trees<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.920> preparation<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.640> grafting<00:01:48.239> I'm

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
trees in preparation for grafting I'm

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.889 
trees in preparation for grafting I'm
thinking<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:49.590> primary<00:01:50.159> scaffold<00:01:50.899> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
thinking about these primary scaffold so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.059 
thinking about these primary scaffold so
I<00:01:51.929> cut<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.679> limbs<00:01:52.860> accordingly<00:01:53.459> and<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:55.069> graft

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
I cut the limbs accordingly and we graft

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.289 
I cut the limbs accordingly and we graft
with<00:01:56.340> bud<00:01:56.929> orientation<00:01:58.429> accordingly<00:01:59.429> as<00:02:00.000> well

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
with bud orientation accordingly as well

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.649 
with bud orientation accordingly as well
so<00:02:01.110> lots<00:02:01.739> to<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.009> about

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
so lots to think about

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
so lots to think about
it's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:03.959> more<00:02:04.049> than<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.289> sharpening

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's a little more than just sharpening

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's a little more than just sharpening
sticks<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.819> poking<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.239> in<00:02:06.420> trees<00:02:07.039> although

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
sticks and poking up in trees although

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.639 
sticks and poking up in trees although
that's<00:02:08.519> what<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> tell<00:02:09.179> people<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that's what I tell people I do for a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.750 
that's what I tell people I do for a
living<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.269> tremendous<00:02:15.930> job

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
living this is just a tremendous job

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
living this is just a tremendous job
would<00:02:17.760> call<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.840> success<00:02:19.319> right<00:02:19.530> here

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
would call this the success right here

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.599 
would call this the success right here
we<00:02:19.859> call<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.750> percentage<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.930> take<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.459> this

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
we call it a percentage of take and this

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.340 
we call it a percentage of take and this
is<00:02:23.760> about<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.030> 99%<00:02:24.840> take<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.109> can<00:02:28.109> hardly

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
is about a 99% take it just can hardly

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.490 
is about a 99% take it just can hardly
find<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.190> did<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.639> grow<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.500> know

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
find one that did not grow I know

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.569 
find one that did not grow I know
they've<00:02:31.739> got<00:02:31.950> them<00:02:32.069> trained<00:02:32.910> up<00:02:33.150> very<00:02:33.450> nicely

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
they've got them trained up very nicely

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.129 
they've got them trained up very nicely
next<00:02:35.579> year<00:02:35.790> they<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.269> some<00:02:36.540> fruit

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139

starting to cut some of them out we put
in<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.069> up<00:03:29.220> graph<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.700> heal<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:30.120> stump<00:03:31.489> on<00:03:32.489> one

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
in an up graph to heal that stump on one

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.670 
in an up graph to heal that stump on one
video<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.120> think<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.510> talked<00:03:33.720> about

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.979 

undifferentiated<00:03:37.680> cells<00:03:38.220> or<00:03:38.519> calcium<00:03:38.989> teach

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
undifferentiated cells or calcium teach

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.899 
undifferentiated cells or calcium teach
you<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:40.560> called<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.659> that<00:03:42.659> is<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.909> tissue

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
you it's called and that is this tissue

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.180 
you it's called and that is this tissue
right<00:03:45.450> here<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.139> can<00:03:46.290> see<00:03:46.470> where<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> cut<00:03:46.739> was

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
right here you can see where a cut was

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.550 
right here you can see where a cut was
made<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.819> tree<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.299> it's<00:03:48.870> healed<00:03:49.139> itself

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
made on this tree and it's healed itself

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.610 
made on this tree and it's healed itself
so<00:03:50.190> that's<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.609> we<00:03:50.760> want<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.120> happen<00:03:51.440> here<00:03:52.440> in

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
so that's what we want to happen here in

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.379 
so that's what we want to happen here in
the<00:03:52.769> graph<00:03:53.010> between<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.669> graphs<00:03:53.910> we<00:03:54.150> want<00:03:54.329> a

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
the graph between the graphs we want a

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.720 
the graph between the graphs we want a
bridge<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.169> it's<00:03:55.859> there<00:03:56.190> that's<00:03:56.609> that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
bridge and it's there that's that

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.839 
bridge and it's there that's that
cousing<00:03:57.329> tissue<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.930> bridged<00:03:58.669> between<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
cousing tissue this bridged between the

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.689 
cousing tissue this bridged between the
graphs<00:04:00.139> if<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.290> don't<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:01.859> enough<00:04:01.889> grafts<00:04:02.400> on

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
graphs if you don't put enough grafts on

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.720 
graphs if you don't put enough grafts on
a<00:04:02.730> limb<00:04:03.319> then<00:04:04.319> they<00:04:04.650> don't<00:04:04.799> bridge<00:04:05.160> all<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
a limb then they don't bridge all the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.569 
a limb then they don't bridge all the
way<00:04:05.849> across<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.859> we<00:04:07.859> don't<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> real<00:04:08.430> long

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
way across and we don't have a real long

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.849 
way across and we don't have a real long
growing<00:04:08.910> season<00:04:09.060> here<00:04:09.569> if<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.440> don't<00:04:10.590> bridge

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
growing season here if they don't bridge

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.400 
growing season here if they don't bridge
across<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:12.329> can<00:04:12.480> start<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.930> get<00:04:13.049> some<00:04:13.109> dye

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
across you can start to get some dye

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.779 
across you can start to get some dye
back<00:04:14.209> down<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.480> trunk<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.489> don't<00:04:17.639> want

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
back down the trunk and we don't want

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.930 
back down the trunk and we don't want
that<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:18.449> these<00:04:18.660> trees<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:20.250> grafted<00:04:20.699> very

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
that but these trees have grafted very

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.469 
that but these trees have grafted very
nicely

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
nicely

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.589 
nicely
grown<00:04:22.199> very<00:04:22.500> nicely<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.849> they're<00:04:24.360> healthy

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
what's going on with his trees and he

a dedication there again that's the
bridging<00:04:53.610> between<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:54.150> graphs<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.630> I

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
bridging between the graphs that I

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.230 
bridging between the graphs that I
talked<00:04:55.020> about<00:04:55.320> but<00:04:55.789> all<00:04:56.789> these<00:04:57.060> things<00:04:57.330> are<00:04:57.680> 14

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
talked about but all these things are 14

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.890 
talked about but all these things are 14
14<00:05:00.240> 16<00:05:01.430> feet<00:05:02.430> tall<00:05:02.460> now<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.389> he's<00:05:03.659> getting

14 16 feet tall now and he's getting

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.100 
14 16 feet tall now and he's getting
quite<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.979> crop<00:05:05.310> off<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.940> these<00:05:06.120> these<00:05:07.020> are

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
quite a crop off of these these are

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.709 
quite a crop off of these these are
producing<00:05:07.740> well<00:05:07.950> this<00:05:08.849> is<00:05:09.060> an<00:05:09.210> apple<00:05:09.479> called
