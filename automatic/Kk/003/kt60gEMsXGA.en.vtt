that's what i like to do with apps like
that<00:01:47.270> anyway<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.170> once<00:01:48.470> it's<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:48.680> your

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that anyway so once it's in your

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.530 
that anyway so once it's in your
applications<00:01:49.850> well<00:01:49.970> let's<00:01:50.120> go<00:01:50.240> ahead<00:01:50.420> and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
applications well let's go ahead and

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.500 
applications well let's go ahead and
open<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.780> up<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:53.409> once<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.560> open<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.950> app<00:01:54.980> up

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
open it up and once you open the app up

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.940 
open it up and once you open the app up
it'll<00:01:56.510> prompt<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:57.080> some<00:01:57.260> updates<00:01:57.650> or

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
updates and there's no updates and then

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.870 
updates and there's no updates and then
we<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.770> do<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.159> they'll<00:02:04.460> show<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.700> your

we can do is they'll show you your

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.790 
we can do is they'll show you your
temperature<00:02:05.300> up<00:02:05.420> at<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.600> top<00:02:05.780> here<00:02:05.840> mine<00:02:06.290> 65

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
temperature up at the top here mine 65

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.979 
temperature up at the top here mine 65
degrees<00:02:07.040> Celsius<00:02:07.490> right<00:02:07.640> now<00:02:07.790> so<00:02:08.659> we<00:02:08.750> want<00:02:08.959> to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
degrees Celsius right now so we want to

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.229 
degrees Celsius right now so we want to
do<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.409> click<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> temperature<00:02:10.819> go<00:02:11.180> to

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
do is click the temperature go to

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.199 
do is click the temperature go to
preferences<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:13.129> I<00:02:13.430> found<00:02:13.969> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
preferences and then I found the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.440 
preferences and then I found the
absolutely<00:02:15.019> perfect<00:02:15.889> setting<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:16.670> Tet<00:02:17.150> for

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
absolutely perfect setting for Tet for

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.059 
absolutely perfect setting for Tet for
temperatures<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.799> we

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
temperatures so we

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.770 
temperatures so we
do<00:02:19.159> is<00:02:19.249> go<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.519> your<00:02:19.879> favorite<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.719> to

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
do is go to your favorite and go to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.690 
do is go to your favorite and go to
default<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.219> drag<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.640> about<00:02:24.099> 35<00:02:25.099> 25

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
default and then drag it to about 35 25

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.959 
default and then drag it to about 35 25
or<00:02:25.760> I'm<00:02:26.030> going<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> put<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> little<00:02:26.540> bit<00:02:27.349> higher

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
or I'm going to put a little bit higher

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.699 
or I'm going to put a little bit higher
3725<00:02:28.969> and<00:02:29.359> that's<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.079> RPM<00:02:30.469> so<00:02:30.590> that's

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
3725 and that's the RPM so that's

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.470 
3725 and that's the RPM so that's
rotations<00:02:31.249> per<00:02:31.340> minute<00:02:31.609> so<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.209> how<00:02:32.269> many

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
rotations per minute so that's how many

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.179 
rotations per minute so that's how many
rotations<00:02:32.689> the<00:02:33.170> fan<00:02:33.379> does<00:02:33.590> per<00:02:33.799> minute<00:02:34.069> and

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
rotations the fan does per minute and

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.099 
rotations the fan does per minute and
the<00:02:34.609> higher<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.969> is<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> fastest<00:02:35.810> fans<00:02:35.959> are

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
the higher it is the fastest fans are

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.330 
the higher it is the fastest fans are
going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> go<00:02:36.409> but<00:02:36.590> also<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.889> louder<00:02:37.129> your

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
going to go but also the louder your
