00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.210
 on the texturing of the pool that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.940
 one then more detailed the element nec 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.049
 the rest of the project, then note that there is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.109
 various effect textures here several 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.590
 effects of shading to give 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 depth to the elements will begin and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.779
 now defining these effects 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.260
 then our file I 'll start here at 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.719
 distributing our texture effect 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 through the ball and select here my 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.879
 ball a moving tool 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.520
 in that folder but also selects the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.350
 This my beloved is selecting 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.320
 here the pool on the edge 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.930
 I'll choose a texture to set 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 this is that part of the border 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
 I'll choose which marble to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.580
 texture had previously chosen 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 nor is it so defined, I will here define a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:18.119
 pattern ok and I'm going to apply the effect now 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 in my role in what I will leave with this 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.590
 same scale value 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.439
 if necessary the fair afterwards 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.130
 and in this edge effect here I go 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.509
 create a small shading for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.610
 start working with this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.850
 layers overlap here will give an ok 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.970
 this same effect I will apply for the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.180
 layer on the second approach that addresses 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.869
 then right-click Copy the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 style selects next layer 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.979
 here and copy the style of reading will stay 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 with this effect here in the next effect 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.750
 which is relative which is the bottom of the pool 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.740
 and a part here that is higher than 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.060
 is a good aac format of a bank is then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.099
 we define here a texture of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:17.800
 a tile then choose here in my 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:22.180
 library a tablet with effect here 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.989
 and tile darkening effect of here the mother 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.989
 it's all right 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:35.160
 I will define here paternal and I will apply 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.160
 this effect now at the bottom of the pool 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.520
 I'm going to slow down the scale that she 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.540
 here of 716 of 10 in opposition to that of 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.790
 ideas here is great only that in the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.570
 detail of this background I need 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.360
 give a depth effect to 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.600
 leave the pool looking like 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.850
 she has a background on the bottom as well 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.140
 relaxed for this I will now use the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:15.700
 effect of inner shannon to inner shadow 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.130
 and watch as you increase here the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.670
 distance it creates a 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.060
 more depth in my pool or 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.130
 defended the distance here in that size 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.850
 I'll put some 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.739
 then note that the swimming pool 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.630
 actually takes effect there from 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.140
 depth 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.320
 this same effect will be applied there in the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:47.549
 I will not copy the effect here and I will 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:52.000
 put the effect on the bench here 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.060
 who has here my depth these 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.480
 here detailed here in the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.780
 pool I will do later and I 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.989
 I'm going to make the water effect on 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.230
 pool and for this purpose 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.489
 I'll do it differently, I 'll go 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.850
 select that my buddy 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.910
 structure and the first tool here 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.940
 of the bar that selection by brand 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.650
 I will choose here the option of mark in 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.880
 elipse this in the structure layer here I go 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.210
 select any region with the shift 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.370
 keypad secures the keyboard chip and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.640
 click here to make my region 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.530
 circular or move that region 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.830
 if I happen to want to change the size 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.220
 of this circular region here I do the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.820
 right-click and transform the 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.949
 cells 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.310
 I can not hold here shift oauth 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.460
 jointly to increase my 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.120
 selection but had to increase given 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.880
 confirm that do not see to increase 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.990
 this selection and I will now have a new 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.520
 layer does not call here will be the layer 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.970
 of water 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.389
 ok I'll choose any color here 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.889
 with the bucket tool prevent 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.949
 selected 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:26.360
 so this layer here in the water it goes 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:29.419
 stay here on the edge right? 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.500
 only under the waterfall and I 'll have 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.110
 use a texture of water to 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:41.060
 apply it on my beloved 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:47.090
 then the bre a water texture in my 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:52.099
 library or use may be this 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:57.340
 texture here is too small or juice in the 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:06:01.160
 texture improved 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:05.300
 I define the same procedure as the 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:10.370
 other elements only and apply texture 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.870
 on my paternal layer ca1 choice here 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.990
 the person of water 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.590
 note that the texture keeps repeating itself 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.970
 here in my reads I'm going to increase here 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.400
 my texture to stop it appearing at 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.909
 repeat so I can see decreased 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.539
 in the texture that adjusting itself by itself 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.539
 mouse here 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.470
 interesting here in this texture or give 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:42.050
 Okay, I'll control your 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.440
 opacity because I have to see the 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.260
 Pool bottom then select aqmi at 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.600
 layer on the beauty guide that I have to 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.780
 opacity option 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.230
 I can go lower here my reads not 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.770
 notice it is start to leave texture 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.960
 here is water in the pool 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.100
 who you will control that which is 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.000
 ideal value I left here the value of 70 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.380
 and here is the effect of my 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.170
 water in my pool 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:20.470
 who can give more transparency if the 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.470
 smoker stay a little bit 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.900
 concealed voting so improved cake 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.590
 59 are being left to the discretion of 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:33.890
 then measures next step in video 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:37.760
 I will detail here the part of the 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:41.150
 cascade is not a waterfall here with a 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.440
 water tank and a staircase here on the stairs 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.440
 access to this box
