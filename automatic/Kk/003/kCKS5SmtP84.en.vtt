art shop so well combined this is our
rough<00:00:25.290> cut<00:00:25.590> area<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.210> where<00:00:27.450> we<00:00:27.570> get

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
rough cut area and this is where we get

rough cut area and this is where we get
all<00:00:27.870> our<00:00:28.110> stock<00:00:28.620> in<00:00:29.210> we're<00:00:30.210> basically<00:00:30.660> dealing

other processes that goes out here is a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
other processes that goes out here is a
quality<00:00:42.329> inspection<00:00:42.960> where<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.499> for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
quality inspection where they look for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.349 
quality inspection where they look for
any<00:00:43.739> cracks<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.519> knots<00:00:44.699> or<00:00:44.969> anything<00:00:45.149> else

any cracks and knots or anything else
that<00:00:45.600> may<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.899> problem<00:00:46.409> later<00:00:46.589> on<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:47.069 
that may be a problem later on the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.419 
that may be a problem later on the
process<00:00:48.170> after<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> stabbed<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.249> wood

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
process after we have stabbed the wood

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.919 
process after we have stabbed the wood
with<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> hydrometer<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> check<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.749> moisture

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
with a hydrometer and check the moisture

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.719 
with a hydrometer and check the moisture
level<00:00:52.499> of<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.859> then<00:00:53.039> bring<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.429> into<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
level of it will then bring it into this

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.910 
level of it will then bring it into this
hot<00:00:53.969> room<00:00:54.269> but<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.350> we'll<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.800> we'll

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
hot room but what we'll do is we'll

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.660 
hot room but what we'll do is we'll
leave<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.339> here<00:00:57.949> for<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.249> three<00:00:59.460> weeks

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
leave it in here for two to three weeks

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
leave it in here for two to three weeks
it<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.059> depends<00:01:00.479> on<00:01:00.569> how<00:01:00.749> wet<00:01:01.019> it<00:01:01.139> is<00:01:01.199> when

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it really depends on how wet it is when

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.809 
it really depends on how wet it is when
it<00:01:01.559> comes<00:01:01.589> in<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.219> we'll<00:01:02.339> dry<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.639> out

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
it comes in here and we'll dry it out

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.240 
it comes in here and we'll dry it out
even<00:01:03.179> further<00:01:03.389> and<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.830> was

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
even further and this right here was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.690 
even further and this right here was
probably<00:01:06.200> seven<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.320> eight<00:01:07.440> hundred<00:01:07.470> tops<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
probably seven or eight hundred tops and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
probably seven or eight hundred tops and
we'll<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.540> through<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> month

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we'll go through all these in a month

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
we'll go through all these in a month
plus<00:01:11.160> them<00:01:11.460> -<00:01:11.730> they'll<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.270> rotate<00:01:12.660> out

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
plus them - they'll have to rotate out

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.020 
plus them - they'll have to rotate out
again

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
again

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.100 
again
typically<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.300> they'll<00:01:15.480> do<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.840> start

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
typically what they'll do to start

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.290 
typically what they'll do to start
making<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> guitar<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.160> they'll<00:01:17.760> mill<00:01:18.060> these

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
making the guitar is they'll mill these

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.720 
making the guitar is they'll mill these
pieces<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> certain<00:01:19.770> specification

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
pieces down to a certain specification

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.080 
pieces down to a certain specification
then<00:01:21.570> they'll<00:01:21.810> join<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> edges<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.970> these

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then they'll join the edges of these

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
then they'll join the edges of these
pieces<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> glue<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.170> together<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:26.370> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
pieces and glue them together at that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
pieces and glue them together at that
point<00:01:26.970> they'll<00:01:27.300> mill<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.780> again<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
point they'll mill it down again and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
point they'll mill it down again and
then<00:01:28.560> laminate<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> whole<00:01:29.400> piece<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> piece

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
then laminate the whole piece to a piece

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
then laminate the whole piece to a piece
of<00:01:30.480> mahogany<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:32.760> one<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
of mahogany and that will go in one of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.140 
of mahogany and that will go in one of
these<00:01:33.120> presses<00:01:33.690> overnight<00:01:34.850> it'll<00:01:35.850> dry

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
these presses overnight it'll dry

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
these presses overnight it'll dry
they'll<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.410> presses

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they'll take it out of the presses

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.100 
they'll take it out of the presses
they'll<00:01:38.130> cut<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> rough<00:01:38.700> perimeter<00:01:39.300> and<00:01:39.870> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
they'll cut the rough perimeter and this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.320 
they'll cut the rough perimeter and this
go<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> milling<00:01:41.280> process<00:01:41.310> where<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
go on to the milling process where the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.480 
go on to the milling process where the
final<00:01:42.750> perimeter<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.680> cut<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.160> an<00:01:44.340> end

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
final perimeter will get cut by an end

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.760 
final perimeter will get cut by an end
mill<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> electronics<00:01:46.290> cavity

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
mill and then the electronics cavity

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
mill and then the electronics cavity
will<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.040> cut<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.550> belly<00:01:47.760> card<00:01:48.120> will<00:01:48.330> get<00:01:48.450> cut

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
will get cut the belly card will get cut

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110 
will get cut the belly card will get cut
perhaps<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.830> trim<00:01:50.100> cavity<00:01:50.580> will<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.820> cut<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
perhaps a trim cavity will get cut in

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.880 
perhaps a trim cavity will get cut in
the<00:01:51.210> back<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:51.960> typically<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> moves<00:01:52.650> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the back and then typically it moves on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.520 
the back and then typically it moves on
to<00:01:53.040> where<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.280> top<00:01:53.460> gets<00:01:53.790> car<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:55.380> these

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to where the top gets car when these

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.680 
to where the top gets car when these
guys<00:01:55.770> start<00:01:56.220> off<00:01:56.370> with<00:01:56.700> guitars<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.420> still

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
guys start off with guitars they still

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.350 
guys start off with guitars they still
have<00:01:57.870> machine

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
have machine

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840

and 16 days to manufacturer neck it's a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.950 
and 16 days to manufacturer neck it's a
lot<00:02:16.900> longer<00:02:17.110> than<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.530> body<00:02:17.770> process<00:02:18.960> instead

lot longer than the body process instead

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.080 
lot longer than the body process instead
of<00:02:20.020> taking<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.830> neck<00:02:21.040> down<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.610> final

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.830 
shape from one of those neck flanks we
take<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.610> bit<00:02:24.790> off<00:02:24.850> during<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> two

take a little bit off during like a two
week<00:02:26.020> process<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> neck<00:02:27.790> gets<00:02:28.090> time

week process so that the neck gets time
to<00:02:28.360> move<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.020> react<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.709> then<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:29.920> umbilical

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
to move and react and then we umbilical

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.750 
to move and react and then we umbilical
at<00:02:30.640> again<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.770> after<00:02:32.770> all<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.070> other<00:02:33.220> stages

one of my problems with the business is
people<00:03:35.520> very<00:03:35.760> often<00:03:35.940> will<00:03:36.180> buy<00:03:36.300> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
people very often will buy the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.270 
people very often will buy the
instruments<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.590> they're<00:03:37.710> beautiful<00:03:38.130> and

then they never play them and they'll

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.150 
then they never play them and they'll
take<00:03:39.660> another<00:03:40.110> instrument<00:03:40.440> out<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.800> play<00:03:40.980> it
