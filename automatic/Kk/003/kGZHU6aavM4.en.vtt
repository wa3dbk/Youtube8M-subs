 one year okay I bought it on the moon and mars 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.110
 would occupy only 49 90 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.110
 because what I had these two valleys 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 gifts you've been waiting for a long time 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 time to buy this game because never 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.719
 in my life I'm going to give 250 in a game 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.340
 this is absurd 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 the prices practiced here in Brazil 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.699
