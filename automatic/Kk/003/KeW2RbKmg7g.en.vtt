00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.890
 shackle for maintenance because good here and still 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.720
 two thirty in the morning 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.859
 I'm in shape no problem 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.859
 hello he notes that as you can see 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.570
 the sun begins slowly for this purpose 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 a project exchanged during the night I went through istres the 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.900
 in the centuries do it harassed by criteria 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.900
 today again and I think all the game like that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.170
 So this is it 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.840
 I realize this club texting pretty well managed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.610
 the time without a stopwatch against motion I realized that I read 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.370
 a lot of bullshit 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 so percent 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.270
 the world number 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.920
 you will not count fps or sugar 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 auch we obviously did not see the future 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.400
 I tested his fragility which is a little video after having after 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.700
 filmed the facts 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.120
 if it does not show it's not worse it will prevent me we have to 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.920
 now go 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190
 % 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.780
 it's here 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.410
 a lot of bullshit a culture 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.200
 remember it more I'm happy 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.260
 to be endowed with a capacity described as an enemy even I am not so 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 early it's a good catastrophic memory 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.540
 that's what I wanted to do 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.900
 nominated 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.010
 in the titanic dig minister accepts such would be already not bad 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 a movement a little bit eliminated 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.980
 carrez I told you 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 the thyssen museum actually 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.640
 m I will not do I'm not ready to ellipse 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.410
 now 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.950
 Talat 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.660
 fascism gg some limits 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.170
 it's a bit logical given 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.260
 5 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.499
 customer is looking forward 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.530
 the torch at all 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.520
 I did not see myself badly if the arrival of Bordeaux passes quickly 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 read again before submitting a text 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.309
 it's unpleasant but it's all the player 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 that's pretty much what's going on 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.199
 creyssel just how unpleasant those who had 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.289
 leaned on and turkey 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 according to it's me 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:25.959
 So here is 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.179
 here we are 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.869
 so 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.909
 I will probably spend a few nights torrent all to find some 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.949
 coal however find it pretty fast like that 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.259
 this magistrate to get into trouble 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.759
 she is also very dark 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.279
 Teneycke 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.729
 I have something to enlighten me 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.059
 I will try to spend a maximum of time 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.479
 other companies 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.999
 on a map 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.859
 so here's a guy like the deer 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.039
 thirty-nine people 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.119
 story besides to make me better tools that it will not be 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.129
 luxury 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.999
 to do this 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.019
 a house 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.559
 their thing 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 a little deeper 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.689
 like that 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.389
 not even better protect I do not know more 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.879
 in any case it will allow me 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.859
 Our era 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.699
 ten miners 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.669
 on the other hand I do not go either 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.189
 to these amounts to do only mm mining 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.079
 the Copts the handbag from the gold in it does not hurt 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.529

 I will not take everything on me as I explained to you luc the goal 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.939
 of all this 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.939
 and to travel 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.269
 this little series 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.959
 ap 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.449
 besides his critics I hope he will 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.219
 enough so if it comes into play nightmare I'll go make him his 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.569
 party to have something to eat 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.129
 1 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.129
 its amount m 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.830
 click click click click click click click stone wait it can not say 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 more 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.150
 specific reference mans 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.629
 6 in the forest 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.480
 little sitting that 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.960
 some old 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.740
 we may find hours 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.889
 champion 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.740
 Thursday ranking is pathetic little reference to his wife this 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.129
 route 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.199
 for those who do not know 4 5 m3 that I urge you to 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.469
 discover if you like 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.650
 I represent the mystic 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.060
 without success I can succeed and I will eventually break the activity 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.439
 I go after 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.439
 all of a sudden the center this coronation 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.650
 I will try out 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.039
 a maximum of even during the night finally to dig 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.820
 agreed, but I do not find it completely as soon as I pull a little bit 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.780
 to read and write some cameos gives me samantha renier 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.139
 you have to see father marc 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.139
 to the exact losc to sing the birds with my brother 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.240
 for who knows 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.490
 much faster 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.719
 you have to stop making me find enough wood 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.349
 mobile we will say that like that 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.159
 - and that's how we have to moult it's what's called 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.729
 that in the middle I think 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.650
 the transport circle I'm showing a ball 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.699
 in a good mood 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.300
 m 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.389
 seeds for the brain 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.679
 1,500 activists spent too long in one place 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.289
 in 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.900
 dubois quickly easily it is easier 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.539
 better to wait a bit 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.539
 that some are looking for a tram-train 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.319
 it was raining 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.319
 you do a little math at 6 with marc 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.289
 to take too much risk either 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.470
 Remains that some teachers more 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.470
 I do not like reading 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.740
 we adopt 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.740
 it gets complicated 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.499
 m so I just realized something 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.160
 so stone like a jerk I still have not handed a stopwatch 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.139
 so this is the visit it's great 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.580
 do that 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.279
 They will not pass 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.719
 8:25 p.m. 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.610
 all chronometer companies gouv fr 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.830
 communal o'keefe 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.770
 like the previous city and we'll see
