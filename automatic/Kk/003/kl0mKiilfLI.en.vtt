00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.420
 good morning everyone 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.680
 - 16 15 after rubik 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.730
 coty 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.730
 this will be a tutorial on the pyramid pyramid method 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.269
 then this method cadistas screen 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.180
 simple just requires to be known is algorithms 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.759
 and good 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.609
 like the work that must be made of cheese making the second good step 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.569
 flirty room 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.509
 your third step is intuitive 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.509
 silly is first I'll explain 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 build 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.900
 bo get three centers I should say contiguous soloists 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.800
 in this case 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.220
 of dogs had not 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.060
 we look for the other time 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.230
 arasti 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.580
 today we enter the pear that we would say 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.530
 every school theater center 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.079
 and the color that is missing is to guide down 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.660
 in this case after green red and yellow 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.740
 therefore the clotet cover about 500 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.580
 the shortage of the olp the tip with the center well 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.970
 orient 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.300
 we go down 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.100
 parksol protect it points 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.180
 we turn 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.550
 we turn 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.040
 the tip and resumed its center 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.960
 silly the third step 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.440
 I would place 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.690
 the piece that we used the mailbox 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 and finally the help plan 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 a text 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.009
 is the first step is purely scientific 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.120
 do not stop practicing here 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.170
 almost almost all of these algorithms 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.530
 there are no textile algorithms 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.440
 you have to find another way to 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.520
 optimize movements 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 for example 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120
 be would place who two movements like that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.160
 but in turn he looked for the piece to stay here 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.450
 to be able to save good wind is to say if it is here I think there is iger 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.190
 and it's here 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 cook area 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.120
 well the tip 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.609
 and always leaving this 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.099
 in my left hand with the dental right 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.099
 this case the soy red color 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.959
 the temptation 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.429
 before I would place 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.839
 the pieces 10 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.370
 and eight high 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.819
 sentenced 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.469
 I will not feel very close to the pass 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:27.069
 and good in the second step is not that it is very intuitive christie's 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.659
 chocovic a couple of examples of DNA will light up pretty well the two 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.099
 transfers 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.990
 but that day 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.999
 conste 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.489
 82 edges 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
 in this case, 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.519
 if so 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.049
 They have wrong 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.379
 we'll see 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.419
 that is to say here to that text 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 it's purely intuitive 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.089
 disoriented the face down that this case is the truth 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.649
 according to whether or if it looks 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.639
 the greens is ballasted therefore 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.009
 forty roger arias 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.959
 exercising another prism we carry 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.549
 tour days 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.829
 and here is your asset 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.139
 the important thing is that I go to the three points here 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.209
 with the three tax corners 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.809
 donceles 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.620
 for him fourth step he was defeated who pays for them 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.549
 no, it's not just an algorithm 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.999
 what would it be to place 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.569
 this piece here 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.999
 pobrecitos tied with cendón blocks 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.629
 on this side 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.780
 and the theater the step will consist of placing 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.780
 the last piece that was missing in that block 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.439
 what we have and now part of done above 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.379
 in this case tragic carlao 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.689
 yellow and red 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.569
 what are we here 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
 and for york is the first serious 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.609
 different state to be the dt well 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.069
 I wish you little crazy here logically your pockets do not go the betis 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.419
 we will place different status 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.509
 is to say that this track will start that wants to climb 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.949
 and that these two different companies 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.470
 if you find yourself like that 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.019
 simply upgrade uu 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
 I can don pesos in the first single is 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:16.509
 the raw bcr the end 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.889
 and we already have placed 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.889
 and we do the moment the stretch 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.539
 for the last drink there are 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.590
 5 algorithms that's good to exclude gold 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.720
 the two cases that he tells us that he repels 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.469
 with the pieces disoriented in these two 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.319
 More eneko we will identify 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.039
 this first case 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.419
 it is not better to wait 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.419
 Ruth Estevez 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.259
 of daughter tumors 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.569
 this case we have three pieces clockwise 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.919
 and these two are disoriented 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.939
 that is to say, resisting to say 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.839
 well oriented not 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.689
 all these clues are green 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.990
 this case the greens are disoriented 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.629
 tondo esp do 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.629
 in a clockwise direction it will always be easy 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.680
 6 are four very simple movements 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.699
 I would recommend that from different angles 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.939
 because it is always useful 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.939
 and the anti-treasury case you're in verse 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.180
 efe 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.460
 we know of four movements very very very fast 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.389
 two other cases that you can touch 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.040
 would be 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.040
 as if it were a pld 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.430
 the reports easily orchestra the whole face a well-oriented 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.370
 and the sun three-piece title 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.759
 in this case, this time delay and this salary 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.039
 you can do it to the bird centenary it would not be this 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.879
 tepic tasks between these two pieces 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.400
 millás in which sense they go oasis ponzi 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.520
 go by and tell yourself the opposite schedule 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.520
 heavy and it would not be this 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.440
 and for the anti-year case it would be good verse 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.069
 then we have another barista that would be the oriental two pieces 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.789
 we have everything well permuted 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.539
 but after having these two 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.539
 and serialized that simple 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.800
 that this surely many of you will know homes otherwise 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.930
 it was a soldier sutures 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.389
 and good 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.830
 It will not be any doubt you have and students do not hesitate to ask 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.539
 this part should be added 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.550
 spiral mexes that I recommend 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.740
 this is a bull cuckoo 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.740
 lubricated with 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.349
 and this is a 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.869
 and that work or logo but luri colo con manu 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:26.520
 but honestly the same I like very much power left the buckets and 

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.360
 pretty dirty 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.360
 but there was a time when it goes pretty well 

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.919
 as well as images 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.629
 that summer 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:39.300
 the annex
