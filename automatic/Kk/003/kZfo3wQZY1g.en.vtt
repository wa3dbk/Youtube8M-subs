00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.020
 the question of how we are headed for later 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.990
 the lavallois just learn dog was going to turn around an object 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 with him and he will use everything that is done but you can also use a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.099
 little soft a kibble container a casting the circular cabinet and not 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.570
 too wide especially for a livestock 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.699
 it is possible to work as well with a lure - at girls 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.660
 m 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 on this video you can see the very first chat session is a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 label with him 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 these laws ten analysts 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.950
 as you saw us skid too much any attempt in the right direction 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 and Italian heads turned in the right direction when it exceeds by 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.110
 action one year before pistilli 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.660
 after the click she tries to compensate them with the head oriented in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.460
 good direction 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.260
 m 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 and as close as possible to the picket jr 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.330
 that's why for this first introductory course to continue the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.450
 food as a reward was much easier to play 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.580
 yes because it is much easier to deliver to the ball in a corner yes 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.540
 so in general I started with food and then only I 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.950
 not replace a toy 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.330
 we can chase him encircled by himself 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.310
 m 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.010
 I do not think it's really uncomplicated I've already got two 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.170
 bites of design kia is circled the picket at the very first special 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.270
 maybe it can take two or three sessions and hood 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.270
 1 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.660
 m 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 after 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 something you have to watch out for 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.479
 in addition to reward near the picket he does it in the right direction 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 nostrils 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 pay attention to what they are doing is not terrible but if you see that the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.200
 back legs melted edmonds still a little bit their own direction a little 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.269
 send outside the tournament 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.719
 so 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.959
 it's normal for a show so young that has not yet a very good 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.479
 awareness of his concerts so to improve his life of all 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.810
 workers are texts relating to the awareness of hind legs that 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.129
 possible 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.490
 and of course working on capital 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.790
 pay attention to the hind legs the tickets understand them it's a lot in 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 career - the secret of the picket 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:51.419
 but Montreal - the singer's body wraps around the party we miss 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.369
 just the logical head and the hind legs in any other 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.239
 possible direction 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 so that's it for the first night session 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.049
 3 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.149
 m 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.429
 now I did another one in the evening so now on the 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.360
 next by m on a sunnier day 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.199
 I'm going to try 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.259
 m 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.079
 and as you can attach it to this year I felt it was a 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.229
 chance to get more time all 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.849
 so she introduces the multiple commitments already at her third 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.689
 team 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.939
 7 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.679
 I like teaching both directions at the same time 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.079
 because normally you will get a first plasma that is the most natural 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.499
 for the cat and while they only worked that one 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.499
 for weeks before Christmas add another direction 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.409
 there is a good chance that the first direction of landmarks and that 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.409
 remains forever the strongest for the dog 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.759
 m 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.029
 witnesses 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:08.379
 so from the 3rd session on and I tried to hold both directions and then 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.829
 to work a little more than the one in which the dog and the 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.949
 natural commander 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:19.209
 all the other dogs were better on the torments a little fishy the 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.259
 afternoon which is the best right aunt rewards more the 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.279
 agpressing torments simply because these are less natural for 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.810
 she that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.810
 May this be 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.440
 now i also want to show you how to use a naughty poplars to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.840
 take a while 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.919
 it's actually a fascinating behavior lopez just rent the dog with 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:47.680
 a shooter 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.050
 the style is an adventure but if possible use an object is lower 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.190
 that which will not be easier you can use a jump 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.210
 a container sinking 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.210
 m 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.819
 also if you choose to work on rumors ask him about the election 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.469
 from the beginning 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.469
 and you can also come the starting orders 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.929
 that is to say that when the dog encircle to the left you can 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.430
 repeat tic tic tic tic 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.430
 why do we anticipate three heads to heads 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.589
 here are some sessions later 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.179
 as you can see I left on a year doped epo which does not involve 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.129
 and as reward stijnen play to make the exercise more decorated 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.900
 a few more sessions but we'll be ready for the next step 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.849
 which is great with this first step is that you can work 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.570
 anytime anywhere no need for a piece of equipment 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.509
 later in our room 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.680
 and you can also start as well with a week hair that with 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.710
 an adult 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.250
 remember that nenni dogs can not take new ones 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.349
 exercises so it's never too late to start and utilities 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.090
 it will always be a help to bring your lap times no matter if you are 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.860
 beginners already champion
