 dynamo tv is presented to you by 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.840
 asti your partner for apple computer 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.790
 systems and development 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:20.760
 cruz can be stefan kÃ¶ber and chef 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:22.640
 coach rudi i'm relieved that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.029
 we hurdle the difficult way out 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 have mastered and done positively 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 which way it made 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 we have got her first 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.300
 half time one or the other error 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 too much made spielverein verein in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.700
 the fas altogether not really round 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.559
 addressed from the halfway though 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.390
 played a lot better especially about 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.190
 played outside and are in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 research reactors and me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.050
 think a deserved victory 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.820
 with us great aspach to over expected 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.030
 how everything had been prepared 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.160
 has demanded and think that this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.219
 team of these associations away 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219
 yourself 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.819
 a statement about the game i think that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 at Vereine actually what a trend 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.470
 but I believe that for the world today 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.590
 a little bit narrower we were able to do 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.209
 have thrown everything in the balance 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.500
 everything around dresden here too 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.509
 to demand that I believe that is us 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.399
 also very well done especially in the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 first half with a bit 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.569
 straightforward and accurate fitting game believe 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.399
 me that we that there is the arrangement 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.410
 situation for us too 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.530
 maybe they are trifles 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.759
 but we certainly do 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.920
 no small things you do not 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.640
 and that's why I am 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.830
 good morning 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.229
 I know that my team today at 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.709
 limit was she gave everything for what 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.390
 try their weeks to do today 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.759
 the little things he's on 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.770
 hit page example to the partner 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.530
 pushes the ball jumps to him before 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.039
 simons relatively short time sausage 21 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.459
 can make 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.050
 he does not make it jump at 21 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.959
 Here are the kids in the sixteenth 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.520
 shoot past and then you will 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.980
 then after the second winner stops 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.079
 Trifles Third League It's fun 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.630
 It was a great experience for mine 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.690
 guys 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.970
 great as the fans are here too 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.220
 presented then that was a mood 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.070
 How should it be football again 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.200
 We wish we both think so 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.600
 Teams contributed to that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.270
 a great game will be a great one 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.460
 afternoon for all that was in the stadium 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.000
 and I think I'm very happy with that 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.660
 my troupe 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.580
 unfortunately without a point today but you have to 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.940
 also say that the dresdner with 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.230
 safety one or for me one 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.680
 the best teams were so far 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.750
 there was 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.330
 they were very structured they have 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.800
 me a little building game over 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.120
 variable then have the second half 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060
 to build up a bit upright 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.700
 changed and that was what I think afterwards 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.830
 maybe the reason is a lot 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.700
 run against us thank you that 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.700
 you ask me your questions 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.930
 Well, I have to pick that up me 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.640
 can happen to anyone but it has to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.650
 fit and I'm still so long 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.950
 not snatched 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.580
 But there are simple situations there 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.830
 that was it out as far as the 3 1 was 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.740
 the victory is practically bagged in the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.550
 Final minutes and I have me 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.960
 incredibly happy 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.140
 who the three points about the art and 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.210
 wise and possibly go even also the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.270
 golde with the trainer but that happens 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.270
 Not 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.390
 I do not know how they feel about it 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.610
 that there is this expectation 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.330
 so 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.250
 Rudiger said that's enough in the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.950
 perception outside the distant worlds 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.620
 but there Both teams to their 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.850
 authority in the third league at the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.910
 Preparation has made both clubs 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
 have done the state and so much 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.940
 is it not in between were there before 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.980
 the game is not that many points 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.230
 in between and accordingly 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.380
 You have to be respectful here, too 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.150
 in the player well in the perception 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.980
 I've set before turning 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.570
 a game and fighting strong groÃŸaspacher 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.190
 Team you are fine with me 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.540
 called the well implemented and 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.770
 Accordingly, I was satisfied 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.770
 and if that is also shown 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.950
 we just have a free kick at the 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.590
 10 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.510
 a free kick allowed of their six 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.100
 seven meters is played the little 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.200
 attack and that's just not enough 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.000
 that will not do 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.710
 I can not be in our own half 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.080
 in the game but probably accept the ball 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.880
 leave and that is not feasible 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.590
 and if we have to do that then 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.240
 of course dissolve in the back then happen 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.100
 rear mistake when we became front 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.740
 start running behind no mistakes 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.000
 then make the superior the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.310
 we have already shown that often enough 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.180
 and the second was next to my two 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.070
 Six not because both six 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.970
 offensive they were both at 16 and then 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.860
 will you come the mouse 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.890
 this is a quality that has taken 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.600
 you do not need to think that we are here 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.880
 Someone on the wall we play 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.450
 For every little thing we have to 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.220
 work 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.900
 and there are two times just not good 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.820
 worked or not clever enough 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.169
 we had to play practically perfect 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.430
 today and this opponent to beat it 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.669
 but not made in these two 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.240
 situation that just so that the ladies 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.240
 and the winner is 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:15.089
 because really serenity 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.589
 today are very clear 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.449
 the ball jumps to the exact and 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.789
 shoot rhein waal tastes to us in 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.139
 who finally gets in and then I think 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.669
 that both teams really horny 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.529
 have delivered friday and then are 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.689
 These little things just crucial 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.119
 was the 3 1 that sometimes synonymous rate more 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:32.009
 That's a great crisis, logically 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:33.330
 and also his career has everything 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.589
 Of course, the over- election of the 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.189
 quality then to the things too 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.399
 exploit 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.330
 but we gave everything today 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.620
 the names or this little bit 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:48.870
 better and therefore have to congratulate 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:52.499
 and we will ask tomorrow 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.289
 in turn, the simple question I may 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.580
 wish them a good trip home and 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.759
 otherwise all a nice weekend 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.189
 See you here again at the sg 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:05.490
 namely holding arena against red white 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:08.479
 Erfurt on the 25th of wednesday plays 90
