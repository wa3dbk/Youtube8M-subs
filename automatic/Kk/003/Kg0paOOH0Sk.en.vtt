00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.049
 because of the increase in freight traffic, the existing space on the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.169
 Roads are better used 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.309
 Figel as an innovative manufacturer of commercial vehicles has this problem 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.619
 recognized and different sees itself for years for the introduction of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.639
 different vehicle concepts by their design the existing 

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:29.519
 Make better use of traffic space 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.519
 and thus relieve the environment 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.710
 For years, Digel has been producing different concepts 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.790
 Country topography and needs to meet these demands 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.150
 Despite the innovative technology, attention was paid to the design 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.190
 find practicable solutions based on standard vehicle concepts and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190
 thus also individually usable over the long term 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.920
 separate the Zuger 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.829
 consists of a standard to machine with any semi-trailer 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.510
 In this vehicle, special attention was paid to the increase of 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 usable volume 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 by connecting semi-trailer with a tandem trailer of its own 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 It can also be driven with any standard motor car 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.320
 possible 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 to transport up to 160 cubic meters by vehicle 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 despite the large loading length, this vehicle combination passes through without any problems 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.550
 next to roundabout 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 and after a short settling in here was the same 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.350
 Maximum volume easy handling and the possibility of punch through Spark 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.920
 Eight and uncomplicated driving are just some of the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 Benefits of the super tears in all its variants have long been proven 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 Has 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.940
 the entrepreneur benefits from maximum volume 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.860
 Freight transport can be made profitable 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.750
 and the environment is relieved by saving trips 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.379
 the Kombi Touring shows its advantages in combined transport 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.659
 up to 23 feet container brother three change bodies can be with this 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.729
 Transport the vehicle 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.509
 another sagging of the rear standard lock she allows the 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.020
 easy division of the entire train 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.950
 and ensures Dandy Keita a Keita simple ranking 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.950
 tractor-trailer 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.520
 when loaded with a change construction 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.460
 The charge carrier may be at HAC discharge after canceling the rear 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.520
 Semi-trailer hydraulic to the stern procedure 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.700
 the saddle clutching is simply lowers Neumarkter 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.700
 and thus gives the hedge flush load 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.270
 Of course it is possible 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.230
 in the lowered position also on the combination shahs she changes he gets until 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.230
 to take up to 40 feet and proceed 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.989
 even buy by rides are thanks to the two swivel joints he easily possible 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.689
 and provide free travel even on small sized roundabouts or in 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.689
 the driveways safe 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.989
 specifically at let transportation between terminal and BVZ 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.270
 the rational use on long distances is profitable for entrepreneurs 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.270
 and a plus for the environment 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.959
 The advantages of the combi trend color fly 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.309
 Super trends 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:10.460
 a standard motor car with fixed or BDF design 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.640
 and a semi-trailer also from Fiege's broad standard program 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.389
 thanks to a bully linked to a train with universal characteristics 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.189
 here are all variants conceivable 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.960
 Motor vehicle in volume version with a mega saddle 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.990
 Motorcar standards and Meder semitrailers 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.750
 or towing vehicle with change construction and a gooseneck semitrailer 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.469
 The combination options are almost inexhaustible 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.969
 big volume Austro Spark Eight of charge Stelter 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.879
 a set of combined traffic and easy handling on the ramp 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.879
 All this is made possible by the use of many German 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.850
 the total train length of 25 2 x 2 5 meters 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.850
 is no obstacle for internal transits 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.610
 despite the long loading length 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.710
 Passes the vehicle against the roundabout Federal is short 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.069
 Acclimation as a standard letter the train was at the ramp rank four 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.469
 the wide program of Dolly it allows the entrepreneur the 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.339
 Individually adapted to his needs and under 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.650
 Consideration of local legislation 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.650
 to carry out the transports profitably 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.400
 individually by country and law as a default 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.479
 clever combination 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.840
 Thiele vehicle concepts with vision for the protection of the environment under 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.849
 Consideration of investment security of transport
