00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.759
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.880
 flash virtus.pro and today we are again 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.460
 let's talk about the Czech Republic it will be like this 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.919
 intermediate final video on how 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.259
 play on the firefly when he's in the top 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.509
 even though we are here at the end 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.510
 Turks hen table but this does not happen 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.880
 more often to be among the fifth only 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.060
 we will definitely get the levels though 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.740
 would be 7 so we pass on the map and the first 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.290
 what did any should do 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 self-respecting firefly is offending everything 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.580
 trees drive up to this wonderful 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 bush and start shining because here 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.840
 already 360 meters 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 shine all who pass why are we 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.220
 doing and why am I not shooting now 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 despite the fact that I can shoot and he 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.890
 I might not even see this one 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 vk 3001 p and this of 2, too, we believe those 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.439
 tanks and basically give our team 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.200
 an opportunity to understand how many tanks 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.810
 enemy go to the second or third line 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 why because if you are on 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 top spawn for you priority 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.620
 right side to attack and this is the tank 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 who go conditional in defense and so we 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.479
 we see that a significant group of cords 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.729
 went ahead and i start shooting at 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.380
 apt-1 why is this the slowest tank of 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 This group and I think that there is more 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 no one will go if he is the slowest 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 already drove it and you can shoot 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.950
 kv-1 we kill what's next oppa glows 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 mt-25 but we don't shoot him we don't 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.690
 hurry nowhere why because if we 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.880
 move on a little or start right away 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.310
 shoot us light the middle tank 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.710
 who usually put this place there 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.680
 where did she come to pap is kontra 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 this is a counter tactic against this firefly 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 if he starts to burn at all 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.250
 parties and we just watch this 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
 Vekashka she drove off super means we in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.049
 principle, we can shoot but what we have 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.479
 here we have a tongue 3-4 here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.519
 died why did he die well first 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.540
 because he was constantly shooting like 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.269
 just saw 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.489
 all that moves this time in the second 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.459
 he just drove away from the wonderful 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.870
 stone do not understand what is happening it 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 lit up 3001 p and they started shooting i 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 I continue to stand in this bush and me 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.849
 very interesting fate t1 heavy 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 for some reason he is worth a plus here for them. 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.739
 someone shichko she moves such 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 swings and now she rode us 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.420
 start not shoot me still worth 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:48.689
 one tank and double doublet we with at-8 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.579
 we understand it perfectly minus this 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.609
 unpleasant light upstairs 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.709
 Hevik goes ahead and something is wrong with him 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.900
 I think so and so 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.840
 happens if you see a tank going 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.489
 Forward, just such a game situation 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.439
 so most likely he flew out during 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.319
 will the tanks of these pirates look back 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.200
 a clear sign that the tank flew though 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.310
 I once saw from earthly ties that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.069
 riding or just all Nadur case 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 just because he really is 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.400
 was 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.800
 online who did he understand what would happen to him 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.480
 with impunity , everyone and everyone disassembled here 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.430
 it's easy enough we make out i mean 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.709
 fall safe distance without looking 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.920
 to the fact that he tried to shoot us and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.080
 arrange a second front 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.720
 attacking the defending group but drove 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.060
 here guys of course attack and we them 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.250
 start shooting from 2 on us 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.440
 is looking 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.019
 make a shot and just to the feeling that 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.739
 time to move off skip this shot 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.349
 by itself the next goal of course from 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.720
 he became such a board and that way 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.720
 he won't even be able to pierce us because 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.790
 we see his back his karma 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.120
 machine and calm there just 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.400
 cram one after another of 2 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.090
 I went ahead I understand that he already has something 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 under need to catch and he is there also 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.900
 dying but everything turns out enough 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.690
 just enemy heavy tanks which 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.139
 could withstand a blow in some measure they 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.850
 all have been overexposed to us through 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.889
 along the line to have gone well great but at the same time 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.050
 nothing sensible they are not 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.090
 depicted respectively main 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.039
 the doctrine of how to play on the ship 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.880
 when the ledge first you are at the beginning 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.190
 shine 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.060
 and then you go and shoot and shoot 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.500
 a lot of reason because besides you 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.389
 very few people can pour in at all 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.430
 in normal damage having a small frame 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.310
 of you for sure will not pay 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.020
 attention and you see this by the figure on 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.030
 first look will be going very 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.660
 just but the result for the next three 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.979
 medals 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.460
 scout support sniper 2649 experience 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.039
 and 38 thousand credits at the near 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.660
 you can see that we shot 2000 damage 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.550
 highlighted 1400 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.630
 and a little bit involved in the action so that 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.699
 pure experience here 2208 many viewers 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.400
 who have long been watching my channel 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.430
 should have understood my doctrine 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.650
 the victory is to quickly 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.410
 make benefits for your team 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.930
 lose a minimum of technology ally they 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.220
 drag fights why because drag fights 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.930
 hard to drag fights against two 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.020
 three or four five opponents who 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.150
 remain against you is not easy and far 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.979
 not everyone can but get 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.910
 advantage at the beginning of the battle it is available 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.919
 almost everyone 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.930
 and one of these maneuvers that you 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.479
 can make on small tanks 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.300
 small in size that crawls through 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.250
 But in this window you happen or not 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.740
 on your bima tanks you can find out in 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.490
 training bout you can commit on 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.590
 monastery map 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.210
 what's going on here now pause now 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.250
 put as you see here goes 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.669
 our active shootout of 4 he already 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.210
 died 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:06.030
 A vazik died here in response and a batt 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.810
 25t and Lorain took positions which in 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.780
 principle can 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.060
 in this case, just keep them 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.759
 this direction monastery press under 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.300
 ourselves we are just not our movement 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.800
 give make we call right Lorain in 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.659
 back and basically any tank that 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.460
 will stand in that position league for 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.669
 we will get him shot and 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.830
 the essence will distract then batt 25t 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.080
 the enemy go to our batchat us 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.360
 Butcher do the right thing departs and I 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.030
 I understand that it is simply discharged therefore 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.789
 he is so eager to get out of here we leave him 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.910
 do not give taro him we put on the caterpillar 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:45.940
 under the boom it to them once it postrelivat 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.410
 the second we leave it free with 7 themes 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.050
 more thrower gets cake 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.470
 ester on the wagon look at the time and a half 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.000
 minutes have passed from the start of the battle and this 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.340
 movement helped us get 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.729
 advantage of level 8 8 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.490
 if our batt 25t is not dead, then also 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.289
 in the tenth level, respectively, because 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.800
 how to shoot here on this line 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:10.060
 very dangerous very few tanks are capable 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.520
 there really is effective 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.919
 shoot and if you think and 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.690
 remember that there are potholes here 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.699
 usually stand a cake and travel here 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.280
 just not safe and this 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:24.220
 Proves each batch 25t is better to lead 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.889
 fire either from above or in this zone below 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.720
 it is safer and of course 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:30.009
 all this action takes place until that moment 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.919
 how will be employed 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.849
 you or your opponent is this old one 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.910
 shelf 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.490
 on 2 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.680
 I wish you good luck and victory 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.300
 in the battles with you was the descent virtus.pro 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.070
 put like a video subscribe to 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.530
 channel and see you soon 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:50.420
 this time on wednesday the next video 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.420
 it will be just then bye bye
