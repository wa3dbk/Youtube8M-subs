00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone guys are android if 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
 welcome to a new video on moto gp 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.650
 15 and welcome to the fifth appointment 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.500
 of our series to date we will use alvaro 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 bautista auburn is a circuit of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 Czech republic and we will leave last as 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.590
 always the first row will consist of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 markets valentino and lorenzo and we will use 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.739
 to aprilia because this year is true 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 passed to aprilia and the race started ok 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:41.870
 I'm saying in April it's a c is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.700
 returned to the motogp after so many years 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.020
 now I don't remember exactly when 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.289
 was the last time he has 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 however participated in the race however it was 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:58.050
 so many years that it wasn't there and yes 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.149
 he is not doing that much in this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 championship however, however, given that the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.019
 our series is to bring all the pilots 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.409
 on all circuits or in any case the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.409
 most of us will also use aprilia 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 finished I hope this video I can 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 pleasure we really did one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.890
 good start and now we hope andrea 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.729
 iannone and bradley smith 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.729
 try 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.009
 who is attention 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.329
 we try not to lose the back 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.999
 cross paths we hope smith e 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.460
 also where at exit of curve also 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.640
 Valentino also entered Lorenzo Mamma 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.249
 in the middle of the lap we are in the middle of the first 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.490
 around we are already seconds with a market 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.490
 in front of ok now they have first 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 c however the first one is fun from 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.060
 driving like a bike I have to say is not bad 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 it's not bad at all 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.450
 it's at 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.090
 in the next videos I will try to get me 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.569
 also to let you see also some races 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.349
 with moto3 riders and moto2 also with 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.500
 the champions that historical pilots can 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.650
 Valentine with the 2001 honda 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.040
 evans dwan and so on 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:33.200
 and in any case they will not be part of this 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.849
 series although I will do in circuits anyway 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 that maybe I've already done in the videos but 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:44.510
 however they will not be part of these 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.980
 series just simple videos so for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.120
 don't always do gp bike riders 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 current given we are leaving for 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 our aprilia 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.480
 in the last video with espargarÃ² not e 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.579
 we could not win 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.290
 of Indianapolis because there are also adults 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.610
 it seems to me and we were third 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.410
 while this time we are leaving 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.410
 white take two seconds to lorenzo 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.260
 bad berno berno talking about bern 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.910
 this circuit is a nice track i have to 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.010
 to say there is a nice track I like a lot 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.980
 the last section or the one the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.850
 but ups and downs I don't like the rest 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.890
 more than that, on the contrary, I like it very much 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.810
 post where this was built 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.190
 circuit 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.010
 or in the middle practically at 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.840
 hills to the woods practically e 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.650
 however, I like this environment 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.010
 really much 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.530
 and yes because while the trait that me 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.330
 like bern and from here to becoming 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.780
 the carts lines after one I like how 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.780
 track 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.440
 the first here skoda a little bit to not a little 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.170
 obviously we are always with all 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.390
 help deactivated difficulties 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.030
 of the artificial agency to its reality 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.140
 manual transmission so all help 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.590
 deactivated we play with the maximum 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.960
 difficulty that the game can offer us is 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.960
 went 4 seconds and a mom market 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.759
 there is not 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.060
 we made a very good output 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.039
 from the last corner I have to say that I thought 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.979
 worse than this first in the sense that I am 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:37.210
 I'm very happy to drive it I'm sorry 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.550
 a lot that I'm not doing good 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.340
 results in motogp for anywhere like 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.780
 I have always liked the manufacturer 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.020
 also because they are Italian together with 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.699
 ducati even if the ducati is mine 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 however, the first was April 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.020
 anyway i don't mind at all 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.719
 five seconds and 1 lorenzo and we have them 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.370
 given my mother 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.370
 well detached from really much 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.310
 we are 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.080
 do these curves well 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.210
 it's the last round and I'd like to go to 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.130
 win this race 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.720
 if we conclude so without errors e 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.419
 falls I would say it was the most race 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.190
 beautiful perhaps of all our series 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.560
 up to here even if only to the fifth 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.720
 episode because we did n't do every 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.840
 fell into error we have not thrown down 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.580
 no one very rare thing because not said 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:46.300
 I talked to the fallen and he got 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.500
 however, I was wrong and therefore 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.000
 this too cannot be considered 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.530
 the most beautiful episode but now we are looking for 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.360
 not to make more of these errors and 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.199
 falls and we go to win ours 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.199
 dear verano 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.860
 1 36 5 to the third sector it seems to me well 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.389
 despite the fall however the 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.020
 posting remains we have given all 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:14.650
 second 7 lorenzo we try to do 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.650
 the surge 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.170
 it was impossible to do 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.660
 a surge but we have unlocked 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.430
 also a trophy 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.960
 now I don't know if I don't know if we'll see 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.110
 in the recording however I have wasted 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.910
 a trophy and no kids we're at 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.260
 level 23 and I hope this video will 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.940
 enjoyed it now enjoy 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.240
 celebrations we see ourselves in a 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.160
 next video and nothing bye bye his 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.080
 happiness is understandable with this 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.280
 victory was imposed on pilots of 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.280
 proven talent
