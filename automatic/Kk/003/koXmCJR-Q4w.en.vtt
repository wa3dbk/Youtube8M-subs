not school video how to tour the
Millennium<00:00:05.029> Falcon

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
Millennium Falcon

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.250 
Millennium Falcon
the<00:00:06.049> famous<00:00:06.290> Star<00:00:06.649> Wars<00:00:06.859> ship<00:00:07.810> the<00:00:08.810> first<00:00:09.080> step

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
the famous Star Wars ship the first step

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.290 
the famous Star Wars ship the first step
in<00:00:09.410> this<00:00:09.560> drawing<00:00:09.800> is<00:00:09.950> to<00:00:10.220> draw<00:00:10.430> a<00:00:10.460> simple<00:00:10.730> oval

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
in this drawing is to draw a simple oval

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.320 
in this drawing is to draw a simple oval
at<00:00:11.450> an<00:00:11.570> angle

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.390 

the<00:00:15.990> next<00:00:16.290> step<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.620> to<00:00:16.740> draw<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> forward

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the next step is to draw the forward

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
the next step is to draw the forward
mandibles<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> bits<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.540> stick<00:00:18.600> out<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
mandibles the bits that stick out of the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.580 
mandibles the bits that stick out of the
front<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> millennium<00:00:20.310> falcon<00:00:21.380> next<00:00:22.380> draw

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
front of the millennium falcon next draw

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.350 
front of the millennium falcon next draw
a<00:00:22.619> center<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> oval<00:00:23.700> ellipse<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.270> we

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
a center to the oval ellipse that we

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.910 
a center to the oval ellipse that we
started<00:00:24.810> with

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.680 

and<00:00:28.010> then<00:00:28.850> I<00:00:29.000> think<00:00:29.060> we<00:00:29.330> could<00:00:29.450> draw<00:00:29.630> the

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
and then I think we could draw the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.440 
and then I think we could draw the
circle<00:00:30.260> for<00:00:30.440> the<00:00:30.530> sensor<00:00:30.980> dish<00:00:31.270> when<00:00:32.270> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
circle for the sensor dish when the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.270 
circle for the sensor dish when the
Millennium<00:00:32.989> Falcon<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.500> coming<00:00:33.800> towards<00:00:34.130> you

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
Millennium Falcon is coming towards you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.590 
Millennium Falcon is coming towards you
the<00:00:34.460> sensor<00:00:34.880> dish<00:00:35.060> will<00:00:35.300> be<00:00:35.390> on<00:00:35.480> the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the sensor dish will be on the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.360 
the sensor dish will be on the
right-hand<00:00:36.050> side<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.650> then<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.890> cockpit

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
right-hand side and then the cockpit

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.640 
right-hand side and then the cockpit
will<00:00:37.610> be<00:00:37.730> on<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.940> left-hand<00:00:38.390> side<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:38.870> now

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
will be on the left-hand side so now

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.710 
will be on the left-hand side so now
I'll<00:00:39.800> just<00:00:39.830> add<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.309> cockpit<00:00:40.790> on<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.540> left

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
I'll just add the cockpit on to the left

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.830 
I'll just add the cockpit on to the left
of<00:00:41.900> my<00:00:42.080> drawing<00:00:43.120> so<00:00:44.120> at<00:00:44.239> this<00:00:44.360> stage<00:00:44.600> in<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
of my drawing so at this stage in the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.570 
of my drawing so at this stage in the
drawing<00:00:45.199> in<00:00:45.350> under<00:00:45.650> a<00:00:45.680> minute<00:00:46.040> we've<00:00:46.280> got<00:00:46.309> the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
drawing in under a minute we've got the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.580 
drawing in under a minute we've got the
basic<00:00:47.000> shape<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.420> Millennium<00:00:47.930> Falcon<00:00:47.960> but

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
basic shape of the Millennium Falcon but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.200 
basic shape of the Millennium Falcon but
probably<00:00:48.890> we<00:00:49.040> haven't<00:00:49.309> got<00:00:49.400> anything<00:00:49.670> exactly

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
probably we haven't got anything exactly

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.650 
probably we haven't got anything exactly
right<00:00:50.860> so<00:00:51.860> I'll<00:00:52.280> use<00:00:52.550> an<00:00:52.730> eraser<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.330> clear<00:00:53.570> up

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
right so I'll use an eraser and clear up

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.299 
right so I'll use an eraser and clear up
the<00:00:53.809> image<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.170> little<00:00:54.199> bit<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.769> drag<00:00:55.040> wreck

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
the image a little bit and drag wreck

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.130 
the image a little bit and drag wreck
things<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.030> I've<00:00:56.360> got<00:00:56.570> several<00:00:56.960> things

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
things now that I've got several things

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.430 
things now that I've got several things
on<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.470> go<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:59.300> now<00:00:59.510> once<00:00:59.780> we've<00:00:59.989> got<00:01:00.019> some

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
on the go so now once we've got some

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.490 
on the go so now once we've got some
basic<00:01:00.890> sense<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.120> proportions<00:01:02.930> of<00:01:03.290> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
basic sense of the proportions of the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.320 
basic sense of the proportions of the
Millennium<00:01:03.920> Falcon<00:01:03.949> I'll<00:01:04.790> start<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.210> add<00:01:05.300> a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
Millennium Falcon I'll start to add a

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.880 
Millennium Falcon I'll start to add a
little<00:01:05.540> bit<00:01:05.659> more<00:01:05.840> detail<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.320> I'll<00:01:06.650> start

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
little bit more detail so I'll start

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.500 
little bit more detail so I'll start
over<00:01:07.130> here<00:01:07.340> on<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.520> left<00:01:07.760> with<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.090> escape

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
over here on the left with the escape

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.649 
over here on the left with the escape
pod<00:01:08.950> which<00:01:09.950> goes<00:01:10.220> from<00:01:10.610> left<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.970> right<00:01:11.210> or<00:01:11.240> two

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
pod which goes from left to right or two

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.210 
pod which goes from left to right or two
of<00:01:11.750> them<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.200> either<00:01:12.440> side<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.830> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
of them one on either side of the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.510 
of them one on either side of the
Millennium<00:01:13.580> Falcon<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.010> I'll<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.190> draw

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
Millennium Falcon so now I'll just draw

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.490 
Millennium Falcon so now I'll just draw
a<00:01:16.549> little<00:01:16.670> bit<00:01:16.850> more<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.540> sensation<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
a little bit more to the sensation the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.200 
a little bit more to the sensation the
right-hand<00:01:19.100> side<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.729> Millennium<00:01:20.180> Falcon

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
right-hand side of the Millennium Falcon

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.230 
right-hand side of the Millennium Falcon
and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.380> at<00:01:21.530> each<00:01:21.680> stage<00:01:22.010> each<00:01:22.280> time<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.610> do<00:01:22.760> a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
and then at each stage each time I do a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.899 
and then at each stage each time I do a
little<00:01:23.600> bit<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.869> drawing<00:01:24.110> or<00:01:24.470> line<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.250> try<00:01:25.850> to

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
little bit of drawing or line I try to

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.910 
little bit of drawing or line I try to
look<00:01:26.119> at<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.390> in<00:01:26.510> relation<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.380> rest<00:01:27.619> of

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
look at it in relation to the rest of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.830 
look at it in relation to the rest of
the<00:01:28.220> ship<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.729> at<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.030> stage<00:01:29.240> I'll<00:01:29.450> speed<00:01:29.690> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
the ship so at this stage I'll speed the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.180 
the ship so at this stage I'll speed the
drawing<00:01:30.080> along<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> little<00:01:30.830> while<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
drawing along for a little while the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.399 
drawing along for a little while the
basic<00:01:31.400> step<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.119> I'm<00:01:32.299> doing<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.810> keeping<00:01:33.049> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
basic step that I'm doing is keeping the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.779 
basic step that I'm doing is keeping the
general<00:01:33.770> shape<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.250> Millennium<00:01:34.759> Falcon

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
general shape of the Millennium Falcon

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.230 
general shape of the Millennium Falcon
intact<00:01:35.719> putting<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:36.859> some<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.850> larger

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
intact putting on some of the larger

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.660 
intact putting on some of the larger
details<00:01:38.689> but<00:01:39.259> not<00:01:39.409> going<00:01:39.649> into<00:01:39.859> any<00:01:40.039> smaller

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
details but not going into any smaller

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.819 
details but not going into any smaller
fine<00:01:41.119> details<00:01:41.539> at<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:41.840> stage<00:01:42.109> because<00:01:42.740> I

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
fine details at this stage because I

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.200 
fine details at this stage because I
want<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.070> keep<00:01:43.219> putting<00:01:43.579> in<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.700> mid<00:01:43.969> size

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
want to keep putting in the mid size

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.319 
want to keep putting in the mid size
objects<00:01:44.689> for<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.409> long<00:01:45.530> as<00:01:45.649> possible<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:46.329> will

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
objects for as long as possible I will

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.999 
objects for as long as possible I will
erase<00:01:47.630> some<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.109> lines<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.560> don't<00:01:48.770> need

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
erase some of the lines I don't need

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.190 
erase some of the lines I don't need
anymore<00:01:49.369> because<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.509> have<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.810> basic

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
anymore because I have the basic

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.410 
anymore because I have the basic
structure<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.009> Millennium<00:01:52.700> Falcon<00:01:52.729> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
structure of the Millennium Falcon and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.230 
structure of the Millennium Falcon and
all<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.500> mid-size<00:01:54.890> shapes<00:01:55.280> are<00:01:55.549> in<00:01:55.640> place<00:01:55.880> so

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
all the mid-size shapes are in place so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.260 
all the mid-size shapes are in place so
the<00:01:56.869> next<00:01:57.079> step<00:01:57.350> will<00:01:57.619> be<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.829> add<00:01:58.460> some<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the next step will be to add some of the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.200 
the next step will be to add some of the
lines<00:01:59.539> of<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.170> armor<00:02:00.530> plating<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.249> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
lines of the armor plating and the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.779 
lines of the armor plating and the
equipment<00:02:02.810> access<00:02:03.020> bays<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.950> circles<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
equipment access bays the circles and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.239 
equipment access bays the circles and
some<00:02:05.329> of<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> tubes<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.289> fact<00:02:06.799> all<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
some of the tubes in fact all of the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.669 
some of the tubes in fact all of the
details<00:02:07.729> can<00:02:07.969> go<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.240> now<00:02:08.420> because<00:02:09.050> we've<00:02:09.440> got

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
details can go in now because we've got

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.720 
details can go in now because we've got
the<00:02:10.070> structure<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.729> which<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:11.150> place<00:02:11.360> them<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the structure in which to place them the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.700 
the structure in which to place them the
stage<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.300> adding<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> detail<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.470> your

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
stage of adding in the detail to your

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.860 
stage of adding in the detail to your
drawing<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> Millennium<00:02:16.880> Falcon<00:02:16.910> should

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
drawing of the Millennium Falcon should

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
drawing of the Millennium Falcon should
take<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> little<00:02:18.290> while<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.950> me<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.760> whole

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
take a little while for me the whole

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.730 
take a little while for me the whole
drawing<00:02:20.120> took<00:02:20.330> about<00:02:20.600> an<00:02:20.840> hour<00:02:21.020> from<00:02:21.260> start<00:02:21.350> to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
drawing took about an hour from start to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.950 
drawing took about an hour from start to
finish<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.880> materials<00:02:23.300> are<00:02:23.420> used<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.810> this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
finish the materials are used in this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.990 
finish the materials are used in this
drawing<00:02:24.230> were<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.410> pencil<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.130> an<00:02:25.250> eraser<00:02:25.370> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
drawing were a pencil and an eraser and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.750 
drawing were a pencil and an eraser and
then<00:02:26.660> later<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.319> drawing<00:02:27.620> I'll<00:02:27.770> use<00:02:28.040> some

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
then later on and drawing I'll use some

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.360 
then later on and drawing I'll use some
thin<00:02:29.060> black<00:02:29.510> pens<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.230> some<00:02:30.800> black<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.040> gray

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
thin black pens and some black and gray

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.410 
thin black pens and some black and gray
Pro<00:02:32.030> marker<00:02:32.420> pens<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.950> block<00:02:34.310> shading<00:02:34.790> so

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
Pro marker pens for the block shading so

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.089 
Pro marker pens for the block shading so
now<00:02:35.660> hopefully<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.409> drawing<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.890> can

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
now hopefully in this drawing you can

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.160 
now hopefully in this drawing you can
see<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.549> importance<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.390> doing<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> basic

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
see the importance of doing the basic

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.539 
see the importance of doing the basic
shapes<00:02:39.440> first<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.980> getting<00:02:40.129> those<00:02:40.370> right

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
shapes first and getting those right

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.830 
shapes first and getting those right
before<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.209> put<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
before you put on the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.630 
before you put on the
details<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.709> then<00:02:42.920> once<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.250> put<00:02:43.400> on<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
details and then once you put on the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.220 
details and then once you put on the
details<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.209> can<00:02:44.239> find<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:44.959> put<00:02:45.080> on

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
details you can find it you can put on

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.530 
details you can find it you can put on
even<00:02:45.950> smaller<00:02:46.280> details<00:02:46.760> which<00:02:47.000> will<00:02:47.209> make<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
even smaller details which will make the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.720 
even smaller details which will make the
whole<00:02:47.720> ship<00:02:48.110> look<00:02:48.590> even<00:02:48.890> larger<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.400> more

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
whole ship look even larger and more

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
whole ship look even larger and more
detailed<00:02:49.989> because<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.140> got<00:02:51.349> smaller

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
detailed because it's got smaller

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:25.729 
detailed because it's got smaller
intricate<00:02:52.370> details<00:02:52.730> within<00:02:53.000> it

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.289 

so<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.769> think<00:03:26.859> as<00:03:27.129> drawing<00:03:27.370> now<00:03:27.579> is<00:03:27.760> ready<00:03:28.000> for

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
so I think as drawing now is ready for

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.720 
so I think as drawing now is ready for
some<00:03:28.719> tonal<00:03:29.379> work<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.189> rather<00:03:30.400> than<00:03:30.579> use<00:03:30.700> a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
some tonal work and rather than use a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.879 
some tonal work and rather than use a
pencil<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.390> time<00:03:31.629> I'm<00:03:31.719> going<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.930> use<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.079> pro

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
pencil this time I'm going to use a pro

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.280 
pencil this time I'm going to use a pro
marker<00:03:33.250> pen<00:03:33.519> I've<00:03:34.030> got<00:03:34.329> several<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.900> them<00:03:35.139> of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
marker pen I've got several of them of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.589 
marker pen I've got several of them of
different<00:03:35.799> shades<00:03:36.069> of<00:03:36.250> grey<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.790> black<00:03:37.150> so

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
different shades of grey and black so

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.449 
different shades of grey and black so
they're<00:03:37.840> very<00:03:38.049> good<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.530> blocking<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.159> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
they're very good for blocking in the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.500 
they're very good for blocking in the
basic<00:03:40.359> times
