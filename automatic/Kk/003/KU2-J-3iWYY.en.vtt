our design process but you can go any

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.830 
our design process but you can go any
any<00:02:44.600> photo<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.270> check<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.720> can

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
any photo you can you can check you can

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.060

afterwards<00:02:49.520> yeah<00:02:49.940> sure<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.570> do<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.840> with

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
afterwards yeah sure you can do it with

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.840 
afterwards yeah sure you can do it with
two<00:02:51.050> approaches<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.160> main<00:02:52.400> difference

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
two approaches but the main difference

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.650 
two approaches but the main difference
is<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.330> can<00:02:53.510> run<00:02:54.040> Facebook<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.670> don't

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
