 I did not buy things again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 nobody else knows anything else at home 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.119
 say as the whole products are because 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 favorite product of dm is or how 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.110
 Also one of the products I have 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 just bought and otherwise would 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 I really enjoy the video like that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 the first product I dm 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.840
 I bought my age is 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 favorite eyebrow piece many 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.230
 i've been following this for some time now 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's the essence euro 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 designer in colors 04 blondes and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 I swear on the nest priced 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 really super cheap and is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.660
 qualitatively so good and that's why I have 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.820
 not even not twice but me 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 directly bought three new because it me 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.270
 very often that happens to me 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.740
 tip off and I with one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.930
 little tip every morning my 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
 must remove eyebrows and believe me 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.409
 people that is the challenge of my 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 life and this time i have mine 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.439
 thought you buy them on stock 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 so you put one in a make-up bag 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 have one in a drawer and one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.799
 can you lose then and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 would have to jumped directly 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.409
 and that's why I have in me three times 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 bought the next with this purchase 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.820
 product that bought me at dm 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 The kts are absolutely big palettes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.619
 as the name implies contains the very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.970
 many pinks from helen to dark 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.360
 drive that means she is perfect 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.340
 for the everyday make-up smokey eyes or 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320
 everything will then create in between 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.259
 I want and I am very excited 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.060
 how this palette is because she has got up 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.260
 in any case similarities with the nex 3 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.480
 because there are these 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.100
 also very pink is funny and I hope 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.660
 times that covers just as well so 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.790
 if you already have experience with the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.620
 absolutely palette of patrice has made 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.000
 can you tell me everything and in the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.410
 Write comments because I have them 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.630
 not tried yet but so 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.430
 beautifully closed with it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.450
 I can still present you 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.550
 but as soon as the camera goes out and that's why 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.500
 I thought if you already have no 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.810
 corner paletta you can at least 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 they can and that's why I have them with me 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.160
 However one eyebrow to the back to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.430
 I have come to make the food make 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 me broadway taken and that has me 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.900
 From the packaging we totally different jimi 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.150
 blue water of benefit reminds because it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.200
 really what looks like one to one 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.110
 and I already have it 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.670
 tried and are driving and sausages 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.530
 almost identical that means if you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930
 You can find benefit products too expensive 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.000
 In any case, that of essens buy that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.110
 I also did that and said 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 just tried and am 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 actually really super satisfied 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.510
 and because it is precisely the will of me 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.170
 benefit changed and I have to eat 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.230
 took 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.450
 and that's why it's part of a wood then 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.580
 I still have three lipsticks from 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.980
 maybelline bought once in 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:08.430
 the color 465 she knows chris fleming 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.920
 725 tanktop and in color 732 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.820
 braithwaite and the color pulls display 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.739
 is a beautiful red and red 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.080
 I think it fits in spring right now 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.330
 really good now where the pro 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.430
 you sprout everything again 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
 bit color I shape I 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.480
 had really like the sun 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.070
 Something bright color on the lips too 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.350
 Wear her you know I'm full anyway 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.570
 the five and red lips because I too 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.220
 a lot of action red but sometimes wear 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.890
 I have the feeling the color is too 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.290
 strong and can not always be connected to the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.260
 Incorporate everyday and that's why I like it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.190
 This blood orange mix is ​​almost red orange 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.500
 mix very very well 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.690
 he has stressed the lips but still 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.150
 is still suitable for everyday use and then have 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.880
 I took two more notes with me 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.560
 I know that I'm a fan of a lot 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.330
 dramatic eyes make ups I am there 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.760
 but do not do if the lips then 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.260
 also still stressed are so to speak and 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.940
 that's why I like to put in the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.160
 background and then you leave on the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.109
 However, lip looks away then 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.850
 as a bit as wanted and 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.320
 I could not do anything 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.870
 wear the lips and that's why I have 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.850
 I took two lipsticks with me 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.920
 I just focus on the eyes 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.739
 can put the lips has reduce 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.620
 and the color title eisentor to halt 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.020
 longer do so and goes into a bit 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.210
 brownish and is a bit darker and the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.230
 color grayson way is then than 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.300
 you would have your away concert and have 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.130
 then just a really nice nude what 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.710
 you then also with a gloss quasi 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.090
 Finnish and that's why I have 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.070
 These three of me would have been founders 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.900
 I want to be super awesome 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.090
 looking forward to what will look like 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.430
 every case still tutorials with it 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.240
 that's why they're in the shopping basket 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.210
 landed 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.710
 Then I have two hair care 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.690
 or styling products 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.270
 Although taken once by 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.639
 tension the klitschkos etten relax 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.520
 express repaired education under florian 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.800
 Paris, however, have with strong 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.110
 shut up and use the six rinse 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.180
 just after the shower or hair 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.490
 if my hair is easy to wash 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.889
 tend to time and each other unrecognized 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.230
 and how to become a bird's nest and I am 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.090
 always a few splashes of it on and 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.950
 they just become super soft and awesome 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.110
 supple and can subsequently 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.240
 really easy by coming without 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.730
 that I feel that my head 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.220
 demolished and this time I have mine 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.320
 even that l'oréal paris eleven starts at 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.000
 just taken because I already 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.400
 always wanted to try and 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.040
 actually only a normal house 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.830
 have used and that here so pleasant 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.630
 I smell trapped in the trap and 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.160
 That's why I took it with me 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.780
 have to say it is really very very 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.420
 pleasant and I'm curious now 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.100
 how good that holds my hair together 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.540
 and how well the hairstyles hold with it 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.920
 and that's why I have with these two 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.810
 products taken away 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.180
 the last beauty product i have 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.820
 has taken in dm of manhattan 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.630
 and that is the endless ocean of 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.350
 englang brass was 5 in the color 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.780
 001 more sorry 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.300
 and who cares a bit about beauty 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.060
 will know immediately that this 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.710
 actually jungle missions soon 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.990
 looks very similar and that is also the 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.570
 Reason why I bought the one myself 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.190
 personally own any xj has hensel 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.900
 But he often with other beauty 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.630

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.460
 never be able to shop then 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.950
 I have seen this part here in the dm 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.970

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.920

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.230
 so I have yet taken 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.720

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.180
 like shadow base usable in any case 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.980
 be or stop like a liter in the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.630
 not so quickly smudged because of that 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.640
 the whole thing keeps very much in any case 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.810

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.730

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.380
 In this regard , I would also like to 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.020
