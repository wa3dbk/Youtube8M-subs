episode of this season now the season
has<00:00:11.160> been<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:11.670> well<00:00:11.790> actually<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
has been going really well actually I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
has been going really well actually I
thanks<00:00:13.019> probably<00:00:13.380> been<00:00:13.469> one<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.710> best

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
thanks probably been one of the best

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070 
thanks probably been one of the best
since<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.460> started<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> series<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> year

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
since I started the series about a year

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.140 
since I started the series about a year
ago<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.640> enjoyed<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.029> but

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
ago now and I've really enjoyed it but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.120 
ago now and I've really enjoyed it but
unfortunately<00:00:18.270> i<00:00:18.840> think<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> series<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.770> just

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
unfortunately i think the series is just

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.519 
unfortunately i think the series is just
kind<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.699> reach<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.150> thin<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
kind of reach to thin and i think that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.859 
kind of reach to thin and i think that
the<00:00:22.650> main<00:00:23.010> reason<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.029> most<00:00:24.480> likely

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the main reason for this is most likely

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.050 
the main reason for this is most likely
because<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.680> sort<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.760> goal

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
because we sort of don't have a goal

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
because we sort of don't have a goal
anymore<00:00:27.529> as<00:00:28.529> I've<00:00:28.710> talked<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.099> before

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
anymore as I've talked about before

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
anymore as I've talked about before
there's<00:00:29.609> sort<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.910> few<00:00:30.060> stages<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.810> any

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
there's sort of a few stages of any

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.459 
there's sort of a few stages of any
Tekkit<00:00:31.439> season<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.050> beginning

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
Tekkit season there's the the beginning

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
Tekkit season there's the the beginning
where<00:00:34.620> there's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> hope<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.640> raining<00:00:35.969> that's

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
where there's a hope it's raining that's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
where there's a hope it's raining that's
that's<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.250> fitting<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that's actually kind of fitting it's a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.260 
that's actually kind of fitting it's a
bit<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> sad<00:00:39.660> day<00:00:39.840> we'll<00:00:40.020> let<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> rain<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
bit of a sad day we'll let it rain and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.369 
bit of a sad day we'll let it rain and
there's<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> beginning<00:00:42.719> where<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.110> fun

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
there's the beginning where it's all fun

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
there's the beginning where it's all fun
and<00:00:43.410> fresh<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.829> new<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> goal<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and fresh and new and we have a goal and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
and fresh and new and we have a goal and
then<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> reach<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> goal<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> we

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
then we kind of reach that goal and we

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
then we kind of reach that goal and we
kind<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> fade<00:00:47.789> off<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.289> just<00:00:49.289> trying

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
kind of fade off into just trying

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.240 
kind of fade off into just trying
different<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.780> then<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:52.020> there

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
different things and then from there

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
different things and then from there
that<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.789> close<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> me<00:00:54.680> from<00:00:55.680> there

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that was really close to me from there

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.639 
that was really close to me from there
we<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> move<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.719> stumbling

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we kind of move on to just stumbling

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.819 
we kind of move on to just stumbling
around<00:00:58.859> no<00:00:59.760> plan<00:01:00.030> no<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.660> nothing<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
around no plan no game nothing and I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
around no plan no game nothing and I
think<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> episode<00:01:02.520> 15<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.539> sort<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
think that episode 15 was sort of the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.679 
think that episode 15 was sort of the
end<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.769> season<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.400> far<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
end for this season as far as the the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
end for this season as far as the the
plan<00:01:06.960> went<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.740> plan<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
plan went the plan was to get to the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.300 
plan went the plan was to get to the
moon<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.820> made<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> may<00:01:09.900> every<00:01:10.080> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> we

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
moon and we made it may every kind of we

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.100 
moon and we made it may every kind of we
sort<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> learned<00:01:11.790> together<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.720> smaller

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
sort of learned together we had smaller

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.570 
sort of learned together we had smaller
goals<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.799> learning<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> set<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.490> an

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
goals like learning how to set up an

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.450 
goals like learning how to set up an
Emmy<00:01:14.820> system<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.540> things<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
Emmy system or things like that now that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
Emmy system or things like that now that
that's<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> out<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.240> though

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that's kind of out of the way though

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.670 
that's kind of out of the way though
we've<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.810> sort<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> been<00:01:19.110> fumbling<00:01:19.470> around

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
we've just sort of been fumbling around

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
we've just sort of been fumbling around
and<00:01:20.040> while<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> did<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.490> fun<00:01:20.700> building<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and while I did have fun building the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.740 
and while I did have fun building the
tree<00:01:22.439> farm<00:01:22.650> over<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
tree farm over there I do think it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630 
tree farm over there I do think it's
time<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> call<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> season<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> close<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
time to call the season to a close and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
time to call the season to a close and
get<00:01:27.210> ready<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> next<00:01:27.869> season<00:01:28.320> season<00:01:28.500> 6

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
get ready for the next season season 6

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310 
get ready for the next season season 6
which<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.570> fundamentally

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
which will be the fundamentally

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
which will be the fundamentally
different<00:01:31.740> than<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.430> previous<00:01:32.790> seasons<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
different than the previous seasons and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
different than the previous seasons and
we'll<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.720> large<00:01:34.049> goal<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.890> have

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we'll have a very large goal will have

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100
