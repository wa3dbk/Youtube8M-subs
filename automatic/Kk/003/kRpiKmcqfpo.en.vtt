the English a hard time and they're just

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
the English a hard time and they're just
proving<00:00:20.760> how<00:00:20.880> good<00:00:20.910> they<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.210> God<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
proving how good they have God at the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
proving how good they have God at the
scrum<00:00:22.020> yeah<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.550> things<00:00:23.910> can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
scrum yeah I think you know things can

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.599 
scrum yeah I think you know things can
go<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:24.720> quickly<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.250> they

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
go around very quickly and I think they

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
go around very quickly and I think they
find<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.060> way<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.269> push<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> fund<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
find a way to push the fund a way to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
find a way to push the fund a way to

you talk to the Japanese pop maybe that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.240 
you talk to the Japanese pop maybe that

try<00:02:59.290> let's<00:03:00.290> listen<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:05.890> here<00:03:06.890> we<00:03:06.980> go

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.759 

yeah<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.390> feels<00:03:14.570> totally<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.290> talking<00:03:15.620> with

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
yeah that feels totally is talking with

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.740 
yeah that feels totally is talking with
that<00:03:15.799> Quentin<00:03:16.250> Walker<00:03:16.579> because<00:03:17.060> he's<00:03:17.299> pushing

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that Quentin Walker because he's pushing

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.539 
that Quentin Walker because he's pushing
across<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:18.920> also<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.250> Japanese

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
across but I think also the Japanese

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.280 
across but I think also the Japanese
cram<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.209> trying<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.600> find<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.930> way<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.079> go

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
cram is trying to find a way to go

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.110 
cram is trying to find a way to go
forward<00:03:21.500> on<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.010> left<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.489> going<00:03:22.700> out<00:03:22.880> on

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
forward on the left just going out on

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.090 
forward on the left just going out on
the<00:03:23.239> left<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> think<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.799> pre<00:03:25.010> has

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
the left so the I think that I pre has

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.069 
the left so the I think that I pre has
to<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.370> sensible<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.299> must<00:03:26.510> understand

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
to be sensible is you must understand

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.259 
to be sensible is you must understand
who's<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.980> where<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:31.340> Japanese<00:03:31.880> will<00:03:32.120> try

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
who's going where the Japanese will try

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.020 
who's going where the Japanese will try
and<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.570> either<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:33.340> penalty<00:03:34.340> try<00:03:34.579> here<00:03:34.910> or

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
and get either a penalty try here or

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.350 
and get either a penalty try here or
even<00:03:36.130> perhaps<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.400> French<00:03:37.730> player<00:03:38.060> into<00:03:38.329> the
