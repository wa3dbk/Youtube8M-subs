00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.639
 by julia giertz de and on the hong 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.680
 kong electronics fair 2014 spring 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.160
 edition and hereby essence I look 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.740
 me that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 currently the world's thinnest smartphone 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.940
 56 mm and we have the good piece 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.400
 it's 4x and that 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.070
 feels very good in any case 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 such a metal housing very well 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.150
 processed beautifully thin and let's go 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.850
 short on the technical data one there 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.480
 we have a 4 inch display here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 a resolution of 640 x 360 pixels it 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.320
 is an amulett you see that already 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.040
 resolution is not exactly that right now 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.110
 winner 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 compared to other smartphones so 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.650
 we have to have the smartphone here already 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 rather in the beginner middle class range 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.260
 I have seen it from the processing 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.460
 really that good i hold it in hand 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 and just think wow 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.370
 I would really have that as 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 processor we have here in mtk 65 72 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.590
 dulko with 1 ghz 512 gigabyte ram 4gb 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.210
 memory for the user and two 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 Cameras are once installed here on the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.150
 back a 5 megapixel camera and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.229
 front of a two-megapixel camera 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.300
 We have micro-usb up here 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 The smartphone is also for one 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.470
 jack plug so we can here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.730
 music only via an adapter so listen 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.720
 micro usb to 35 mm jack plug here 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.550
 with the power button 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.040
 Here comes the micro sim card 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.470
 and here on the left we have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.750
 in loud quieter button to here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460
 the three touch buttons for android here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 below 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.870
 and yes, as far as I can see that is not here 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 micro sd card slot with you and not 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.820
 so we have to expand a lot 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 get along what a beginner 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.850
 should create theoretically 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220
 Of course it is a pity 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 entry-level device is like I said it 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.760
 feels so good that I actually too 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.260
 when 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.980
 Real capital of use 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.740
 The battery is of course one 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.960
 a bit weak-hearted with 1300 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 milliard hours but in these 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.620
 Nevertheless, technical data should be available 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 some hours and enough 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:25.080
 128 grams, it weighs 120 in height 60 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 millimeter in width and 56 mm in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 the thick the currently thinnest smartphone 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.230
 In the market the essence will fix it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.720
 already in colombia and france 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.000
 away on and if in germany now 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 a dealer says okay that's really 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.140
 a very interesting smartphone then 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.150
 I can make the contact clear because 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.030
 the company is still looking for one 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.100
 distributor for Germany so if 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.050
 you know someone knows the interest 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.900
 I can only say that 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.610
 Processing really top and price 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.670
 seen in any case 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.020
 very interesting if you have to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.370
 just ask yourself in below 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.330
 She wants the comments as soon as possible 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.460
 possible answer 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.410

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.010
 Of course, if you like the video here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.410

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.870
 Thank you for watching here again 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.870
 to fix the technical data of it 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.080
 who the violence 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.080
