out of the packaging anyway if not

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.270 
out of the packaging anyway if not
they'd<00:00:39.050> come<00:00:39.230> from<00:00:39.350> Taiwan<00:00:41.680> get<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.800> branding

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
they'd come from Taiwan get the branding

they'd come from Taiwan get the branding
they're<00:00:44.680> like<00:00:45.680> some<00:00:45.950> sort<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:46.220> laser<00:00:46.400> etching

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.080 

press<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.630> wheel<00:00:50.780> everyone<00:00:51.530> seems<00:00:51.830> to<00:00:52.090> try

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
press the wheel everyone seems to try

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.850 
press the wheel everyone seems to try
and<00:00:53.300> wiggle<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:55.960> wiggle<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.560> new

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
and wiggle the wiggle this on a new

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.090 
and wiggle the wiggle this on a new
turbo<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:58.730> not<00:00:58.850> sure<00:00:58.970> that's<00:00:59.090> going<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.360> prove

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
turbo I'm not sure that's going to prove

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.479 
turbo I'm not sure that's going to prove
it<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.400> it's<00:01:01.970> new<00:01:02.560> bearings<00:01:03.560> are<00:01:03.680> good<00:01:03.829> you'd

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
it so it's new bearings are good you'd

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.100 
it so it's new bearings are good you'd
expect<00:01:04.909> this<00:01:05.540> are<00:01:05.750> stainless<00:01:06.140> steel

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
expect this are stainless steel

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.300 
expect this are stainless steel
looks<00:01:09.110> like<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:09.620> oil<00:01:10.280> return<00:01:10.700> line<00:01:12.220> flexible<00:01:13.220> to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
looks like a oil return line flexible to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.590 
looks like a oil return line flexible to
get<00:01:13.430> around<00:01:13.640> stuff<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.270> OEM<00:01:14.960> ones<00:01:15.170> solid<00:01:16.540> go

actuator about 15 psi which is the
standard<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.510> offer<00:01:36.660> I've<00:01:37.080> got<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> factory

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.280 
standard they offer I've got a factory
one<00:01:38.310> I'll<00:01:38.430> probably<00:01:38.730> put<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> start<00:01:40.200> the

one I'll probably put on to start the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.400 
one I'll probably put on to start the

yeah compressor wheel the hot side wheel
sorry<00:03:19.140> exhaust<00:03:19.590> wheel<00:03:19.890> turbine<00:03:21.440> let's<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
sorry exhaust wheel turbine let's just

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.430 
sorry exhaust wheel turbine let's just
call<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.830> everything<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> could<00:03:23.550> possibly<00:03:23.580> be

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.199 

just<00:03:28.440> gently<00:03:28.890> giving<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:29.970> spin

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
just gently giving it a little spin

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
just gently giving it a little spin
there<00:03:30.450> seems<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.080> spin<00:03:31.760> really<00:03:32.760> freely<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
there seems to spin really freely it's a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.590 
there seems to spin really freely it's a
light<00:03:35.250> touch<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:37.190> know<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.480> considering<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.570> has

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
light touch I know as considering it has

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.470 
light touch I know as considering it has
only<00:03:40.020> been<00:03:40.230> lightly<00:03:40.740> oiled<00:03:41.310> probably<00:03:41.820> it's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
only been lightly oiled probably it's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.290 
only been lightly oiled probably it's
not<00:03:42.600> too<00:03:42.750> bad

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
not too bad

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.900 
not too bad
yeah<00:03:45.300> yeah<00:03:45.720> good<00:03:46.170> looking<00:03:46.290> unit<00:03:46.910> looking

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
yeah yeah good looking unit looking

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.080 
yeah yeah good looking unit looking
forward<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.269> getting<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.720> car<00:03:49.610> and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:02.030 

probably<00:03:54.090> sit<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:59.100> sort<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.519> layout<00:04:01.040> in

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
probably sit in that sort of layout in

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
probably sit in that sort of layout in
the<00:04:02.160> car<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.709> bit<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.010> you'll<00:04:05.130> be<00:04:05.220> able

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the car so the bit that you'll be able

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.699 
the car so the bit that you'll be able
to<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.670> from<00:04:06.209> from<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.050> side<00:04:07.290> when<00:04:07.590> we're

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
