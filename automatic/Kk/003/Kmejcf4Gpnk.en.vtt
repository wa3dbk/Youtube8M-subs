want to change weapons just slide this
right<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.590> weapon<00:01:47.009> right

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
right here but I like this weapon right

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
right here but I like this weapon right
here<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> keep<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
here so I'm going to keep that but just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539 
here so I'm going to keep that but just
remember<00:01:49.290> anytime<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> change<00:01:50.310> guns
