 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.300
 video tutorial on how to use a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.509
 xbox 360 controller as I'm trying 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.190
 to do for you and any 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.770
 game is that you want me I have 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 decided to buzz for minecraft so 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.210
 first you will need xfire x 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 so here I do not know how 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.180
 geometry will become description you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 install once you get it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.600
 install you are interested you will have to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.600
 you will have that and you will have to help him 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 here you go click here you make 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 liu is then plugging your controller 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 you make start 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
 then you do the sticks you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 do you check the box and you 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 do all sides then you to 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:04.739
 2 ESSTIC here to show voice box 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 the device then the pad you put 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.680
 here at the live foolproof as they 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:21.299
 so here are the buttons then 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:23.210
 that's the end walt the triggers the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.030
 copied buttons on all buttons 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.280
 so that's the joystick equipment those of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 behind 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.829
 starbucks and I think we all had 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800
 buttons 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.960
 Yes 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:42.920
 then you're finished this clause is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.880
 then down we are not born that all of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 next because I said to 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.100
 configure for example six months was 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.690
 placed an order in mayence for example these 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.940
 two sticks before I touched who 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.920
 know the bad and low for example in 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 the minecraft commands to advance cw 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.660
 so I clicked on it I doubled 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.070
 I try cross and then and then down 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.160
 I can replicate the commands from my 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.960
 keyboard with my xbox command 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.410
 when i can play minecraft i'm going 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.410
 make an example 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.790
 that's the challenge 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.120
 so in fact he there I do not know there 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.090
 smile I did with the joystick 2 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:36.280
 Mamadou Diop 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:39.970
 here it is on this world so I am 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:49.540
 the 7 was bad if the first 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 tutorial then there that bug a lot to lease 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.510
 so there I handle with my xbox controller 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.090
 pity I can not show you by 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.909
 your cellar something like that like that I 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.980
 could you find it but it works 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.780
 so to note on windows seven 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.879
 it does not work you have to do something 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.480
 that I will show right after 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.879
 So here I am, I 'll go back to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.170
 keyboard is not very fast anyway 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.799
 the joystick 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.900
 so when you will have x played hours 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.260
 it will be necessary to make right pic follow the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 windows seven makes property 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.379
 accounting and there you tick the box 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.819
 and 7 windows xp service pack 3 months 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.250
 as follows under windows vista service 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.510
 pack 2 and I have if you have eight of these 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.849
 france service pack 3 booba votes here 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.280
 everything for you to touch I tell you to to 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.579
 the next to a possibility has the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.579
 boys
