00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you'll find this got a p0 171 if I go

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.439 
you'll find this got a p0 171 if I go
back<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.750> where<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> PCV<00:00:19.470> hose<00:00:19.910> attaches<00:00:20.910> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
back here where the PCV hose attaches I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
back here where the PCV hose attaches I
can<00:00:22.289> make<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> run<00:00:22.769> better<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.369> finger

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
can make it run better with my finger

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.050 
can make it run better with my finger
that's<00:00:24.689> because<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> full<00:00:26.550> knowledge

that's because I have a full knowledge

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.050 
that's because I have a full knowledge
on<00:00:27.359> how<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.900> manly<00:00:28.250> no<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.519> kidding<00:00:29.880> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
on how to be manly no I'm just kidding I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.280 
on how to be manly no I'm just kidding I
do<00:00:30.840> okay<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.090> plugging<00:00:33.360> off<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> PCV

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
do okay I'm just plugging off the PCV

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.740 
do okay I'm just plugging off the PCV
system<00:00:34.940> positive<00:00:35.940> crankcase<00:00:36.270> ventilation

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
system positive crankcase ventilation

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
system positive crankcase ventilation
that's<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> compression<00:00:38.579> gases<00:00:39.120> go

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that's when the compression gases go

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
that's when the compression gases go
around<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> piston<00:00:40.020> rings<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
around the piston rings down into the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
around the piston rings down into the
block<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.270> need<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> way<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> escape

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
block and then they need a way to escape

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.830 
block and then they need a way to escape
but<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.559> doesn't<00:00:43.829> blow<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.460> balloon<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.629> an

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
but it doesn't blow your balloon like an

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
but it doesn't blow your balloon like an
engine<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.649> vice<00:00:46.950> versa

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
engine or vice versa

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
engine or vice versa
so<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.410> vapors<00:00:49.710> those<00:00:50.190> positive

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so all of those vapors those positive

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.150 
so all of those vapors those positive
crankcase<00:00:51.149> pressure<00:00:51.660> vapors<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
crankcase pressure vapors come out to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
crankcase pressure vapors come out to
the<00:00:53.280> top<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> top<00:00:54.030> lid<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> engine<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the top the top lid of the engine the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
the top the top lid of the engine the
valve<00:00:55.289> cover<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.920> they're<00:00:56.489> captured<00:00:57.000> by<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
valve cover and they're captured by this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.810 
valve cover and they're captured by this
hose<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> hose<00:00:59.160> goes<00:00:59.520> around

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
hose and then this hose goes around

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110 
hose and then this hose goes around
underneath<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:01.109> behind<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.120> connects

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
underneath back behind here and connects

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759 
underneath back behind here and connects
onto<00:01:03.359> there<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> used

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
onto there you can see where that used

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.820 
onto there you can see where that used
to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:06.780> hose<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.380> no<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.680> not

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to be a good hose and no it's not

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
to be a good hose and no it's not
basically<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> 90<00:01:09.180> degree<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.080> those

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
basically a 90 degree know what those

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950 
basically a 90 degree know what those
vapors<00:01:10.610> comes<00:01:11.610> oil<00:01:11.970> vapors<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> oil

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
vapors comes oil vapors and the oil

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.190 
vapors comes oil vapors and the oil
vapors<00:01:13.820> cause<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> rubber<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.479> deteriorate

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
vapors cause the rubber to deteriorate

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
vapors cause the rubber to deteriorate
and<00:01:16.229> break<00:01:16.439> down<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.670> what's<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> deal<00:01:18.810> with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and break down so what's the deal with

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.090 
and break down so what's the deal with
p0<00:01:19.560> 171<00:01:20.340> lean<00:01:20.670> bank<00:01:21.000> 1<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.830> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
p0 171 lean bank 1 well you get you have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
p0 171 lean bank 1 well you get you have
an<00:01:23.430> air<00:01:24.119> fuel<00:01:24.360> meter<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> tells<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.740> how

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
an air fuel meter that tells you how

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
an air fuel meter that tells you how
much<00:01:26.009> airs<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> matches

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
much airs going in and then it matches

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.740 
much airs going in and then it matches
for<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.350> much<00:01:28.560> fuel<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.700> extra<00:01:30.270> air<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
for how much fuel so if extra air is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
for how much fuel so if extra air is
getting<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.070> past<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
getting in and it's not going past the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
getting in and it's not going past the
doorman<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> doorman<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.380> trying<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
doorman and the doorman is trying to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
doorman and the doorman is trying to
keep<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> place<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.820> balance<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
keep the place at the right balance of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.380 
keep the place at the right balance of
men<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.930> women<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> club<00:01:37.909> I'm<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.210> using

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
men and women in the club I'm just using

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
men and women in the club I'm just using
any<00:01:39.630> example<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.409> bear<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.040> me<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.820> our

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
any example I can bear with me so our

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
any example I can bear with me so our
air<00:01:42.090> sneaking<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> through<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.470> got

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
air sneaking in through here so we got

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.370 
air sneaking in through here so we got
way<00:01:44.040> too<00:01:44.070> much<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.180> versus<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:46.020> air

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
way too much of one versus the other air

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.560 
way too much of one versus the other air
versus<00:01:46.860> fuel<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> our<00:01:47.399> air<00:01:47.610> fuel<00:01:47.850> mixture<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
versus fuel and our air fuel mixture and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
versus fuel and our air fuel mixture and
so<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> running<00:01:49.860> too<00:01:50.220> lean<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.210> that's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
so it's running too lean and so that's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.380 
so it's running too lean and so that's
why<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> 171<00:01:52.710> lean<00:01:53.250> bank<00:01:53.579> 1

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
why you get the 171 lean bank 1

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
why you get the 171 lean bank 1
Thanks<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.230> know<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.500> engines<00:01:56.040> stick<00:01:56.400> like

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
just like your check engine light shape

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.749 
just like your check engine light shape
this<00:02:06.000> only<00:02:06.240> has<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.840> bank<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:08.429> smells<00:02:08.700> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this only has one bank that smells like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.200 
this only has one bank that smells like
rotten<00:02:08.850> eggs<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:09.570> turn<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> off<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:11.060> bunch<00:02:12.060> of

this<00:02:17.250> problem<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.180> replace<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> little

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
this problem is to replace a little

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.860 
this problem is to replace a little
elbow<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:20.459> pull<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.120> other<00:02:21.240> half<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.750> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
elbow we pull out the other half of it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.420 
elbow we pull out the other half of it
so<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.470> what<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.709> looks<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:25.430> see

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so you can see what it looks like see

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.949 
so you can see what it looks like see
there's<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.970> vacuum<00:02:27.420> nipple<00:02:27.780> down

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
there's a little vacuum nipple down

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.230 
there's a little vacuum nipple down
there<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> nipple<00:02:29.820> that's<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.209> I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
there see the nipple that's what I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.479 
there see the nipple that's what I
pulled<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> off<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.100> sucking

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
pulled it off of so that's just sucking

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.240 
pulled it off of so that's just sucking
in<00:02:32.640> air<00:02:32.910> straight<00:02:33.390> into<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> intake<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
in air straight into the intake and so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850 
in air straight into the intake and so
there's<00:02:35.520> not<00:02:35.670> extra<00:02:36.000> fuel<00:02:36.690> being<00:02:37.440> allotted

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
there's not extra fuel being allotted

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.710 
there's not extra fuel being allotted
because<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.820> rations<00:02:39.360> how<00:02:39.510> much

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
because of this this rations how much

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.650 
because of this this rations how much
fuel<00:02:40.020> goes<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:41.040> match<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.520> air<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.480> with

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
fuel goes in to match the air so with

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.510 
fuel goes in to match the air so with
extra<00:02:43.020> air<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.890> no<00:02:44.040> wonder<00:02:44.370> it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
extra air going in it's no wonder it's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.900 
extra air going in it's no wonder it's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
point 0 3 volts and it'll spike back and

forth when you goose the throttle Fuson
it<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.860> just<00:03:32.100> means<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.370> rev<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.730> real<00:03:32.910> quick

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
it all just means you rev it real quick

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
so when I do that I watch a multimeter I

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.820 
so when I do that I watch a multimeter I
know<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.840> responding<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.650> not

lot<00:04:14.030> more<00:04:14.270> than<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.630> kicking<00:04:15.050> around

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
lot more than this kicking around

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.720 
lot more than this kicking around
oftentimes<00:04:15.910> here<00:04:16.910> we<00:04:17.000> go<00:04:17.150> green<00:04:17.780> card<00:04:18.049> stuff

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
oftentimes here we go green card stuff

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.430 
oftentimes here we go green card stuff
so<00:04:19.730> this<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> kind<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.480> area<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.900> expect<00:04:21.320> to

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
so this is the kind of area to expect to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.410 
so this is the kind of area to expect to
find<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.070> see<00:04:22.190> all<00:04:22.280> these<00:04:22.400> different<00:04:22.610> PCV

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
find it you see all these different PCV

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.050 
find it you see all these different PCV
grommets<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.230> things<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.640> is<00:04:25.850> where

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
grommets and things so this is where

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.230 
grommets and things so this is where
we're<00:04:26.240> hunting<00:04:26.660> today<00:04:27.490> see<00:04:28.490> if<00:04:28.610> we<00:04:28.760> can<00:04:28.940> find

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
we're hunting today see if we can find

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.680 
we're hunting today see if we can find
something<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.990> looked<00:04:30.740> like<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.340> does

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
something that looked like it it does

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.540 
something that looked like it it does
this<00:04:32.690> says<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.140> for<00:04:33.320> Ford<00:04:33.620> trucks<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
this says it's for Ford trucks but the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.430 
this says it's for Ford trucks but the
diameters<00:04:35.210> look<00:04:35.450> right<00:04:35.950> let's<00:04:36.950> check<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.340> out

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
diameters look right let's check it out

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.030 
diameters look right let's check it out
back<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:39.680> some<00:04:39.890> more<00:04:40.040> SS<00:04:40.400> GM<00:04:40.820> Chrysler

back here some more SS GM Chrysler
Chrysler<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.780> don't<00:04:44.960> care<00:04:45.140> what

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
Chrysler and so on but I don't care what

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.170 
Chrysler and so on but I don't care what
it<00:04:45.410> says<00:04:45.440> if<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.890> diameters<00:04:46.550> are<00:04:46.700> correct<00:04:47.000> I'm

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
it says if the diameters are correct I'm

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.370 
it says if the diameters are correct I'm
going<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.420> use<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.720> here's<00:04:47.870> one<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.140> says

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
going to use it here's one that says

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.860 
going to use it here's one that says
Ford<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.850> then<00:04:50.000> oftentimes<00:04:50.300> on<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.720> back

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
Ford and then oftentimes on the back

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.420 
Ford and then oftentimes on the back
side<00:04:51.110> of<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.260> card<00:04:51.500> I'll<00:04:51.650> say<00:04:51.860> what<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.190> fits

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
side of the card I'll say what it fits

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.910 
side of the card I'll say what it fits
for<00:04:53.270> example<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.930> forward<00:04:54.560> with<00:04:54.800> the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
for example this is a forward with the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.600 
for example this is a forward with the
5.4<00:04:55.520> liter<00:04:55.790> 98<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.600> 97<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.470> bet<00:04:58.220> we<00:04:58.340> can<00:04:58.490> make

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
5.4 liter 98 to 97 I bet we can make

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.750 
5.4 liter 98 to 97 I bet we can make
this<00:04:58.760> fit<00:04:59.000> for<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> 2002<00:04:59.870> Ford<00:04:59.900> Focus<00:05:00.640> so<00:05:01.640> we're

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
this fit for a 2002 Ford Focus so we're

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.160 
this fit for a 2002 Ford Focus so we're
looking<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.120> inner<00:05:02.330> diameter<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.110> outer

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
looking to inner diameter the outer

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.990 
looking to inner diameter the outer
diameter<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.860> very<00:05:03.920> deceiving<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.880> this

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
diameter is very deceiving on this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000 
diameter is very deceiving on this
particular<00:05:05.480> one<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:06.230> looking<00:05:06.530> across<00:05:06.740> that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
particular one but looking across that

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.410 
particular one but looking across that
inner<00:05:07.190> diameter<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.910> actually<00:05:08.240> looks

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
inner diameter this actually looks

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.300 
inner diameter this actually looks
really<00:05:08.510> close<00:05:09.110> we're<00:05:09.830> going<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.010> give<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.250> a

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
really close we're going to give it a

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.970 
really close we're going to give it a
try<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:10.790> one's<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.410> 46<00:05:12.410> oh<00:05:12.740> 17<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.440> don't

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
try this one's a 46 oh 17 so I don't

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.850 
try this one's a 46 oh 17 so I don't
even<00:05:16.070> know<00:05:16.310> where<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.580> got<00:05:16.850> that<00:05:17.680> somewhere<00:05:18.680> up

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
even know where I got that somewhere up

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.860 
even know where I got that somewhere up
there<00:05:19.070> they're<00:05:19.610> all<00:05:19.790> around<00:05:20.060> three<00:05:20.540> or<00:05:20.630> four

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
there they're all around three or four

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.210 
there they're all around three or four
dollars<00:05:21.230> six<00:05:21.530> dollars<00:05:21.620> there<00:05:22.370> we<00:05:22.460> go<00:05:24.220> there

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
dollars six dollars there we go there

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.840 
dollars six dollars there we go there
you<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.820> one<00:05:26.540> of<00:05:26.720> one<00:05:26.900> p01<00:05:27.560> 71<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.760> we're

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
you have it one of one p01 71 so we're

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.070 
you have it one of one p01 71 so we're
going<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.120> didn't<00:05:29.360> erase<00:05:29.570> this<00:05:29.840> because

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
going to I didn't erase this because

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.300 
going to I didn't erase this because
we've<00:05:30.260> repaired<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:32.620> hold<00:05:33.620> that<00:05:33.830> down<00:05:36.160> let<00:05:37.160> it

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
we've repaired it hold that down let it

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.630 
we've repaired it hold that down let it
ride<00:05:37.990> done<00:05:38.990> so<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.040> one<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.340> wound<00:05:40.490> up

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
ride done so the one that wound up

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.270 
ride done so the one that wound up
working<00:05:40.850> was<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.270> 46<00:05:41.930> Oh<00:05:42.080> 17<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.800> was<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.100> one

98 but anyway work great so let's go
ahead<00:05:55.669> and<00:05:55.990> one<00:05:56.990> plot<00:05:57.320> turn<00:05:57.830> this<00:05:57.980> off<00:05:58.220> so<00:05:58.550> it

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
ahead and one plot turn this off so it

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.370 
ahead and one plot turn this off so it
doesn't<00:05:58.940> think<00:05:59.360> it<00:05:59.450> lost<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.750> computer<00:06:00.230> when

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
doesn't think it lost the computer when

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.400 
doesn't think it lost the computer when
we<00:06:00.500> unplug<00:06:00.860> this<00:06:01.040> one<00:06:01.630> computer<00:06:02.630> area<00:06:02.960> network

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
we unplug this one computer area network

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.840 
we unplug this one computer area network
problem<00:06:04.040> no<00:06:04.730> we're<00:06:05.000> good<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:06.320> start<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.740> up

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.630 

running<00:06:11.570> smooth<00:06:11.840> now<00:06:12.200> another<00:06:12.980> issue<00:06:13.220> was

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
running smooth now another issue was

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.250 
running smooth now another issue was
that<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.090> brakes<00:06:14.390> weren't<00:06:14.690> working<00:06:14.810> very

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
that the brakes weren't working very

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.020 
that the brakes weren't working very
good<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.710> power<00:06:15.920> boost<00:06:16.280> wasn't<00:06:16.700> working

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
good the power boost wasn't working

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.940 
good the power boost wasn't working
effectively<00:06:17.300> because<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.200> vacuum<00:06:18.680> tree

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
effectively because that vacuum tree

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.670 
effectively because that vacuum tree
that<00:06:19.190> that<00:06:19.790> uses<00:06:20.210> for<00:06:20.450> the<00:06:20.600> PCV<00:06:21.080> system<00:06:21.290> it

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
that that uses for the PCV system it

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.640 
that that uses for the PCV system it
shares<00:06:21.920> it<00:06:22.160> for<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.960> vacuum<00:06:23.960> booster<00:06:24.380> for<00:06:24.530> the

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
shares it for the vacuum booster for the

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.650 
shares it for the vacuum booster for the
brakes

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
brakes

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.810 
brakes
so<00:06:26.660> no<00:06:26.870> more<00:06:27.050> hissing<00:06:27.590> it's<00:06:27.950> running<00:06:28.340> nice<00:06:28.550> and

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
so no more hissing it's running nice and

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.170 
so no more hissing it's running nice and
smooth<00:06:29.120> got<00:06:29.930> a<00:06:29.960> good<00:06:30.170> fix<00:06:30.730> you<00:06:31.730> should<00:06:31.940> be<00:06:32.090> able

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
smooth got a good fix you should be able

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.700 
smooth got a good fix you should be able
to<00:06:32.300> find<00:06:32.570> one<00:06:32.720> of<00:06:32.750> these<00:06:32.900> at<00:06:33.080> your<00:06:33.170> local<00:06:33.380> auto

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
to find one of these at your local auto

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.890 
to find one of these at your local auto
parts<00:06:33.800> store<00:06:34.130> but<00:06:34.580> if<00:06:34.700> not<00:06:34.880> I'll<00:06:35.330> go<00:06:35.510> ahead<00:06:35.630> and

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
parts store but if not I'll go ahead and

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.460 
parts store but if not I'll go ahead and
put<00:06:36.020> a<00:06:36.050> link<00:06:36.260> in<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.440> description<00:06:36.650> for<00:06:37.130> one
