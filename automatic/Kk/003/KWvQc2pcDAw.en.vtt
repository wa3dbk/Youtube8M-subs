00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 then it's not welcome to the point 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.940
 one trainer school today in the subject of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 pokemon customer and today we take 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 pokémon tune what it is honestly 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.529
 has earned in this format her turn 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 to come 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.740
 trikke farlow jersey driver developed 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.619
 only on level 64 but that has synonymous 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 quite his reasons for jersey is 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.500
 damn complex it has one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.390
 enormous moves aetka both values ​​so 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 both offensive and special 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 offensively deals a lot of damage 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 and it's just so layered that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 you just have to say jersey is for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.899
 Many pokemon are a big danger 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 when it comes into play and is therefore 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 the danger completely right in this 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.050
 Follow the pokémon trainer school 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 represent 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.530
 phase one of this sequence provided videos 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.260
 have not seen here just have a look 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.270
 click on it and watch it is worth it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 But we come now as always 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 weaken and resistances table of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.659
 trike trikke driver and his safe 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 before developments are the only 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.350
 pokémon of the type and I wear thus has 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 it is two minutes, namely by the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 Float the ground type and of course 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.979
 compulsory the operation half of the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 damage from the types of fire electric 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 plant water and light and spirit too 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 fear 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 fight the contract ice and holidays 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.329
 are very effective 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 The Fina can refuel trick safely 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.369
 pretty much to get everyone else 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.869
 types affect orders farlow normal 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.430
 effective from maybe like the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.619
 one or the other think like me 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 this always start any 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.460
 to criticize status values 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 this works but contributions drive 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 just not because the status values are 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 really so solid that you get away from it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 the trick has to be driven 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.450
 real all-rounder on this point 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.939
 He says it's a relatively high initiative 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.900
 with 98 in the base to medium offers 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.509
 is relatively many pokémon it has one 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.420
 and special attacks of 125 in the base 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.010
 and a very high attack of 105's 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.260
 means whatever trick you like 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.680
 likes to meet offensively and specifically 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.960
 offensive ass meets with some damage 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.790
 because there is still a very complex 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.890
 roars move is the danger no 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.290
 definite danger when fighting 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.210
 Who really sees something else now 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 want to nag and the initiative 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.350
 criticized if trick danger only one 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.110
 initiative of 101 could have it 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.840
 some pokémon offer more out of well 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.580
 at 98 it just stops but me 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.450
 find jersey ride is in this point 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.610
 just a real punch we come 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.680
 Now to the skills of trainer Favre 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.930
 Only one skill can be won 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.600
 own the love hover 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.680
 Pokemon can not attack from the ground 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.660
 to be hit 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.380
 I think that nobody needs closer 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.020
 Explanation we come to a lot now 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 serviced section posts farlow den 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.810
 sensible attacks the lazy farlow 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.970
 can learn 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 There are really so many that I am 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.410
 partly not really had the place 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.360
 here to list all war 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.040
 can make a whole band of meaningful 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.410
 but you have to learn 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.320
 fair enough, the pokemon once said it 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.840
 that's the biggest move pool in terms of 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.640
 can even have his values 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.739
 Trick danger is therefore a pretty 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.930
 powerful and versatile boom like 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.870
 already mentioned for example it can be the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.610
 tantrum name or focus street 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.170
 charge current not special attack too 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.700
 may increase as and the opponent 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.400
 initiative 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.530
 donna honors dental dark forces and so 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.660
 on and on it can be really 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 many attacks took many 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.160
 the dangers are over with the dirt 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.799
 with it then of course play with her 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.989
 window synonymous because both are steps 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.269
 then you can already 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.730
 almost decide but some will 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.530
 definitely the flames throw prefer 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.959
 because of that, of course, many 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.880
 beetle steel pokémon is the trick 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.459
 Dangers can also be sensitive 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.860
 and so it's a blaze if you have one 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.600
 change to such a program preaches whole 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.970
 useful but as you said you have 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.639
 really free choice in the attacks and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.989
 Ricardo can be very useful 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.209
 learn attacks 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.960
 So we come now must also he 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.490
 could make sense with ricardo 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 let's get to the heights of the trick 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.169
 I'll risk you something common 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 pattern on the left and a little bit 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.650
 more extraordinary smith looks on the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.259
 imagine the right side 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.169
 Let's start with the left side 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.789
 driving is an election year pokémon 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.340
 that is, it can only be an attack 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.250
 of course, but it is all the more 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.650
 faster ability is clearly floating that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 being is hurriedly rising 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.970
 initiative and it sinks 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.509
 defense value the iv we distribute 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.780
 4 as follows for the attack 252 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:03.319
 special attack and initiative alternatively 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.830
 could he also 200 in special attack and 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.449
 56 investing in the iron 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.340
 switzerland for example against pokémon like 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.750
 make phlox more effective 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.199
 Here we would already be with the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.460
 attacks jersey meteor lintel tail 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.990
 and turn around 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.110
 where the turn also by the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.020
 power colossus could replace this trio 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.539
 has only one goal every pokémon possible 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.250
 very effective or neutral to meet 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.680
 then harm as much as possible 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.800
 cause jersey meteor and sinister 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.020
 are step turn around safe switch and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.150
 iron welding and powerless can you 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.400
 especially effective in meeting pokémon 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.199
 that's why this one is special 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.630
 interesting trick without risk and how 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.900
 I find a fairly common music 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.759
 for this pokémon here we come now 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.949
 second, something more extraordinary 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.349
 music of trick safe while that 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.150
 the first third he was something 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.469
 both offensive and special 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.669
 attacking offensively is this trio 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.229
 exclusively specifically offensive and 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.430
 bronze turns on his 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.620
 start fullest 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.020
 the far that we lazily fall up is 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.819
 life still cares about this ability 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.590
 continue to exploit 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.960
 the ability of course it remains 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.759
 the same is the essence of the shy 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.319
 So he increases the initiative value and it 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.539
 then does not sink used attack 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.160
 We value the value as evn vertan easier 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.260
 on the contract value and 252 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.660
 also special attack and initiative 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.060
 The attacks are as follows jersey 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.800
 meteor firestorm dark and the 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.600
 mocking it the less accurate 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.060
 firestorm also by the exact 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.200
 Flames throw could replace this 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.480
 trick has only one goal 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.760
 any annoying stolp pokémon out 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.100
 clear away with the distant and 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.410
 especially effective in front of all that 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.870
 steel beetle pokemon true as cher 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.120
 ochs and imagines and of course with 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.430
 jake around meteor and darker so much 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.530
 harm as it is possible to hand out 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.360
 Problems will be the risk of this trick 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.490
 all things against fairies and 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.290
 get your own kite types 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.970
 since this is not to please war 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.250
 and you should do better 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.740
 retreat otherwise this is 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.600
 jersey phallus really super suitable for 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.340
 severely weakening opponents per man 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.480
 and her with other pokémon then 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.480
 finally to finish 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.120
 Thank you for seeing my
