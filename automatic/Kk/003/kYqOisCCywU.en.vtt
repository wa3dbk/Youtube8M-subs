makeup thing I can't everyone thing and
I<00:00:39.449> would<00:00:39.510> say<00:00:39.809> concealer<00:00:40.409> because<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.979> study<00:00:41.850> so

concealer<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.920> thinking<00:00:56.069> you<00:00:56.429> know

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
concealer but I was thinking you know

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
we can improve it permanently so I've

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.340 
we can improve it permanently so I've
been<00:01:02.699> trying<00:01:02.999> a<00:01:03.089> lot<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.299> eye<00:01:03.600> products<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

been trying a lot of eye products and
before<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> did<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.640> theory<00:01:05.940> where<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
before I did have this theory where you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.800 
before I did have this theory where you
wear<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.800> moisturizer<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.480> I'm<00:01:09.660> like

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.700 
well that should be good enough because
I<00:01:11.430> could<00:01:12.300> just<00:01:12.330> dab<00:01:12.870> a<00:01:12.900> little<00:01:13.050> bit<00:01:13.260> under<00:01:13.590> my

my eyes hydrated this is being so thick
that<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.840> does<00:02:33.170> actually<00:02:33.439> slip<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.069> slide

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
that it does actually slip and slide

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
that it does actually slip and slide
when<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> sleep<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.450> don't<00:02:35.480> really<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:35.989> this

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
when I sleep so I don't really like this

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.649 
when I sleep so I don't really like this
and<00:02:36.470> um<00:02:36.859> it's<00:02:37.280> only<00:02:37.489> from<00:02:37.700> wrinkles<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
and um it's only from wrinkles so it

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.300 
and um it's only from wrinkles so it
doesn't<00:02:38.989> really<00:02:39.139> target<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.920> things<00:02:40.129> that<00:02:40.280> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310

die the I don't want to say dive but I
don't<00:02:55.010> want<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.189> say<00:02:55.310> bleach<00:02:55.549> but<00:02:55.790> actually

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
don't want to say bleach but actually

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.349 
don't want to say bleach but actually
that<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.359> what<00:02:56.689> it's<00:02:56.810> actually<00:02:56.959> doing<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.709> um

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
that is what it's actually doing is um

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.970 
that is what it's actually doing is um
just<00:02:59.359> giving<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.750> illusion<00:03:00.139> that<00:03:00.169> is<00:03:00.500> lighter

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
just giving the illusion that is lighter

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.949 
just giving the illusion that is lighter
but<00:03:01.609> what<00:03:01.819> happens<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.419> often<00:03:02.599> always

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
but what happens is you often always

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.960 
but what happens is you often always
have<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.470> continue<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:03.919> use<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.609> order<00:03:04.909> for

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
have to continue to use it in order for

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.970 
have to continue to use it in order for
the<00:03:05.209> dark<00:03:05.629> circles<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.409> look<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.799> it's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the dark circles to look like it's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.399 
the dark circles to look like it's
actually<00:03:07.099> going<00:03:07.549> away<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:08.389> don't<00:03:09.139> know<00:03:09.230> it's

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
actually going away so I don't know it's

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.670 
actually going away so I don't know it's
real<00:03:09.590> expensive<00:03:09.889> and<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.900> only<00:03:12.079> just<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.470> dark

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
real expensive and it only just the dark

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.670 
real expensive and it only just the dark
circles<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.299> texture<00:03:14.750> doesn't<00:03:15.139> seem<00:03:15.319> to

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
circles and the texture doesn't seem to

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.729 
circles and the texture doesn't seem to
really<00:03:16.669> replenish<00:03:17.359> my<00:03:17.540> skin<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.260> actually

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
really replenish my skin it actually

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.439 
really replenish my skin it actually
just<00:03:19.159> glides<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:19.879> stays<00:03:19.940> there<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
just glides on and it stays there it

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.449 
just glides on and it stays there it
doesn't<00:03:20.720> really<00:03:20.930> soak<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.889> I<00:03:22.159> don't<00:03:22.400> really

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
doesn't really soak in so I don't really

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.140 
doesn't really soak in so I don't really
like<00:03:22.729> this<00:03:22.879> as<00:03:23.060> much<00:03:23.709> um<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.799> did<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.849> skincare

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
like this as much um I did this skincare

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.229 
like this as much um I did this skincare
eyeline<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.139> this<00:03:27.979> is<00:03:28.159> the<00:03:28.400> recharge

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
eyeline and this is the recharge

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.309 
eyeline and this is the recharge
moisture<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.409> I<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:32.030> did<00:03:32.690> use<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.079> for

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
moisture and I actually did use this for

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.649 
moisture and I actually did use this for
a<00:03:33.349> very<00:03:33.530> long<00:03:33.650> time<00:03:33.829> because<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.639> did<00:03:34.970> not<00:03:35.090> see<00:03:35.419> a

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
a very long time because I did not see a

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.379 
a very long time because I did not see a
fast<00:03:36.560> result<00:03:36.979> on<00:03:37.129> it<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:37.729> I<00:03:37.760> didn't<00:03:38.030> use<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.150> for
