 more past him what are you calling 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.129
 classically for example not only 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 French literature all great 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.639
 classic is classic not 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.920
 complicated for example yes yes in 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.450
 holidays and that's classic without 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.879
 Japanese invention either and switch 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.069
 that's because I wanted to show that 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.459
 it's an option that has served me for a 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.560
 videos 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.419

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.280
 code of the road this is what is 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:53.419
 still going on we have stuff we did not 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.400

 France what is it 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.989
 owner of that because I 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.180
 said it does not seem that tobacco 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.290
 will also be a little normal cold sperm 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.299
 to what I mean why does it smell 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.010
 the cold sperm here bah if you want it's 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.449
 an institution in the family there is 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.970
 all a little a little ritual before 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.599
 that guests have not missed this 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:19.159
 joke a bit heavy but that's it 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.090
 no no no sperm the cold by 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.949
 against these agreements concord we could 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.710
 so video games poker case 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.210
 ah yes for the moments a little badens 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.680
 night getting used to the state 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.909
 but maybe it's the sperm is 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.500
 near and me to yes more presence here 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.729
 pretty tidy and the idea of ​​putting 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.169
 my shoes on a desk it seems 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.840
 low logic 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.280
 what are you talking about ah yes I prepare my 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.340
 ski boots what I expect from them 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.270
 left all alone and it is because what 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.580
 that I'm going to the pool 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.960
 he was already furious said so no I do not 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.010
 do not want to go to the pool 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.990
 quite frequently 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.389
 once a year to maintain this body 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.919
 boissieu superb and I chose 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.120
 Battering glasses that go with my style 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.280
 American 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.490
 yeah and I remember I think 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.780
 it's a month I get like a mitt 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.010
 we agree no but here I did 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.760
 it's been a year that I want I want 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.500
 return to the pool 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.740
 yes and as I have to go to ski paris 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.610
 that you have to get a little leggy 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.190
 so it's been a week since I have to 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.020
 go and prout 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.510
 so that's a certain street artist 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.100
 Parisian I understood then you 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.190
 love to love that kind of thematic 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.389
 I do it for me in fact that but in 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.770
 the more it is true he who sticks his 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.780
 stickers in paris I do not even know his 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.970
 together in his name but he gets 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.220
 will certainly recognize it got a little 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.810
 more capitalistic it's google + but 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.520
 also be there duck and everything 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.650
 yes that's it you're rewarded with the trick 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.479
 so here it's just a little bit matter 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.039
 what from a point of view how to say 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.200
 political orientations 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:48.720
 and then we have to apple because because 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.250
 I found it right now that a good is 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.190
 what it feels like to have become the new 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.610
 idol of the net 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.930

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.169
 number is good 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.180
 it's in millions of seen almost 100 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.620
 millions of views we can say that we can 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.020
 live from 20 million views 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.120
 in touch a lot 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.560

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.300
 outlook of the month no no we see 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.090
 so that 5 65 million views really 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.430
 almost 100 million wishes in one 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.560
 little year knowing that before I did 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.350

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.289
 and 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.490
 I do not count in it but it makes 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.369
 it was still a long way 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.139
 behind yeah and for a year alone 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.789
 it does that it does that about 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.509
 check but here it is it's not it's 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.550
 not the most important 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.869
 well if its facing a meaning it means 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.610
