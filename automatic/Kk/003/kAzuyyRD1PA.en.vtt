the first turn but so i would say how

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.110 
the first turn but so i would say how
many<00:02:47.110> cards<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.380> your<00:02:47.440> hand<00:02:47.620> he'd<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.730> six

and if you or if you already

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.820 
and if you or if you already
overextended<00:02:51.489> like<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.410> ninety<00:02:53.410> percent<00:02:53.440> of

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
overextended like this ninety percent of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.949 
overextended like this ninety percent of
the<00:02:53.920> time<00:02:54.400> he's<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.060> kill<00:02:55.269> your<00:02:55.450> entire
