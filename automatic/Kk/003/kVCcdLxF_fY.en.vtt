00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
can find that you have spider mites very

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
can find that you have spider mites very
early<00:00:55.739> stage<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:57.260> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> light

early stage you can see here the light

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
early stage you can see here the light
levels<00:01:02.210> okay<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:04.140> their<00:01:04.320> yellow<00:01:04.710> spot<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
levels okay see their yellow spot and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
levels okay see their yellow spot and
leaves<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.060> happens<00:01:09.799> when<00:01:10.799> spider

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
leaves so that what happens when spider

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.070 
leaves so that what happens when spider
mites<00:01:11.520> start<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> feed<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:14.299> plants<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:18.080> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
mites start to feed on plants and the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.370 
mites start to feed on plants and the
yellow<00:01:19.500> spots<00:01:20.189> start<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> appear<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.170> if

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
yellow spots start to appear here so if

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
yellow spots start to appear here so if
you<00:01:22.530> flip<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.189> leaf<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.600> really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you flip the leaf over can see really

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.679 
you flip the leaf over can see really
well<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.790> I'll<00:01:30.030> tell<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> you

wanted to show you and I have one plant

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
wanted to show you and I have one plant
where<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> situation<00:01:57.810> went<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:59.130> bit

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
where the situation went a little bit

where the situation went a little bit
too<00:01:59.759> far<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> held<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:04.049> plant<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
too far so I held this plant for a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.440 
too far so I held this plant for a
couple<00:02:06.090> weeks

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.270 

just<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.629> show<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:10.989> what<00:02:11.349> can<00:02:11.590> happen<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:12.129> you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
just to show you what can happen if you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.750 
just to show you what can happen if you
don't<00:02:12.459> control<00:02:12.910> spider-man

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
don't control spider-man

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.600 
don't control spider-man
as<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.739> start<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:20.129> too<00:02:21.129> much<00:02:21.340> of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
as you can see start to get too much of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.850 
as you can see start to get too much of
those<00:02:21.790> yellow<00:02:22.120> spots<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.349> don't<00:02:26.650> do

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
those yellow spots and if you don't do

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.570 
those yellow spots and if you don't do
anything

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
anything

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.589 
anything
eventually<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.530> plant<00:02:29.799> will<00:02:30.040> die<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:31.360> will

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
eventually the plant will die it will

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.979 
eventually the plant will die it will
drop<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.500> leaves<00:02:33.840> everything<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
drop all the leaves everything and

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.539 
drop all the leaves everything and
number<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.140> spider<00:02:38.470> mites<00:02:38.799> will<00:02:39.069> be<00:02:41.549> very

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
number of spider mites will be very

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.949 
number of spider mites will be very
large<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.470> will<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.190> spray<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.780> in

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
large so you will have to spray but in

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.089 
large so you will have to spray but in
this<00:02:47.110> situation<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:49.060> still<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:51.069> be

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
this situation it still can be

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.559 
this situation it still can be
controlled<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.730> biological<00:02:55.660> methods<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
controlled by the biological methods and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.050 
controlled by the biological methods and
that's<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.840> methods<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.500> we<00:03:00.069> use<00:03:00.099> mainly<00:03:00.910> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
that's the methods that we use mainly to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
that's the methods that we use mainly to
control<00:03:01.510> our<00:03:01.750> pest<00:03:02.170> population<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.950> very

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
control our pest population so a very

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.340 
control our pest population so a very
good<00:03:09.090> beneficial<00:03:10.090> insect<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.049> spider

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
good beneficial insect for the spider

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.610 
good beneficial insect for the spider
mites<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.609> situation<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.200> what<00:03:14.410> we

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
mites in this situation and that what we

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.129 
mites in this situation and that what we
use<00:03:15.359> usually<00:03:16.359> very<00:03:17.109> often<00:03:18.569> it's<00:03:19.569> called<00:03:19.870> fight

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
use usually very often it's called fight

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.210 
use usually very often it's called fight
I<00:03:20.170> see<00:03:20.590> Leos<00:03:20.859> /<00:03:21.220> simulus<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.709> comes<00:03:23.950> in

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
I see Leos / simulus so it comes in

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.520 
I see Leos / simulus so it comes in
bottles<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:25.120> mixed<00:03:25.930> with<00:03:26.430> vermiculite

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
bottles like this mixed with vermiculite

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.589 
bottles like this mixed with vermiculite
like<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
like that

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.839 
like that
so<00:03:31.599> almost<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.530> bottle<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.609> little

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
so almost use this bottle just a little

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.000 
so almost use this bottle just a little
bit<00:03:33.970> left<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.690> show<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:34.989> how<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:35.799> apply

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
serious / simulus it's very aggressive

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.990 
serious / simulus it's very aggressive
that's<00:03:58.000> also<00:03:58.480> from<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.019> family<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.530> mites<00:04:00.000> but

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000

that's the beneficial mite that feeds on

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.280 
that's the beneficial mite that feeds on
spider<00:04:04.180> mites<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.780> very<00:04:05.560> aggressive<00:04:06.160> bugs<00:04:07.290> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
spider mites so very aggressive bugs so

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
this bottle on the plant like this let

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:43.250 
this bottle on the plant like this let
the<00:06:34.500> bugs<00:06:34.740> come<00:06:35.010> out<00:06:37.820> and<00:06:41.570> maybe<00:06:42.570> two<00:06:42.840> more<00:06:43.050> or

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
the bugs come out and maybe two more or

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.460 
the bugs come out and maybe two more or
two<00:06:43.830> days<00:06:44.100> from<00:06:44.340> now<00:06:44.540> I'm<00:06:45.540> gonna<00:06:45.720> have<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.200> come

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
two days from now I'm gonna have to come

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.510 
two days from now I'm gonna have to come
back<00:06:46.710> and<00:06:46.950> check<00:06:47.310> and<00:06:47.520> see<00:06:47.750> how<00:06:48.750> many<00:06:49.520> this

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
back and check and see how many this

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.660 
back and check and see how many this
beneficial<00:06:51.150> might<00:06:52.080> we<00:06:52.770> have<00:06:52.980> on<00:06:53.190> each<00:06:53.340> leaf

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
beneficial might we have on each leaf

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.200 
beneficial might we have on each leaf
and<00:06:54.380> we<00:06:55.380> have<00:06:55.830> to<00:06:56.010> compare<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.730> number<00:06:57.000> of

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
and we have to compare to the number of
