get a sunroof fitted in the canopy as

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.319 
get a sunroof fitted in the canopy as
well<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.069> your<00:03:48.220> side<00:03:48.430> rails<00:03:48.700> which<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.209> was

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
well as your side rails which I was

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.599 
well as your side rails which I was
talking<00:03:49.659> about<00:03:49.720> there<00:03:50.280> give<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> little

bit<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.819> better<00:03:52.000> idea<00:03:52.090> now<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.450> I'm<00:03:52.629> up<00:03:52.720> on

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
bit of a better idea now that I'm up on

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.660 
bit of a better idea now that I'm up on
top<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.230> car<00:03:53.409> and<00:03:53.980> again<00:03:54.220> as<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.340> can<00:03:54.519> see
