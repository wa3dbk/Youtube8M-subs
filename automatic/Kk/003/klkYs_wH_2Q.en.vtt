00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.142
 This applies to the rib pain on the body - possibly distributed in different positions 

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.710
 Although it is often caused by shocks 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.040
 But it can also be caused by excessive cough or muscle strain 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.512
 Here is how we will post 

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:22.338
 This app is the area where we first find pain. 

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:27.476
 Then stretch the skin as much as possible 

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:30.511
 In this example I will use a red dot 

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.557
 To indicate a point of pain 

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:36.300
 Your pain may be toward the front or rear of the chest 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.799
 As for my first bandage, I will tear off a section of the type I bandage. 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.908
 Form a fixed point at the end of the bandage logo 

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.483
 I will remove the back paper 

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:54.218
 At the same time, I have to use a bandage without stretching on the fixed point. 

00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:58.362
 Then peel off the backing paper 

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.637
 Again - when there is no tension on the bandage 

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:10.867
 There is no tension at the other end. 

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:15.342
 Remove another type I bandage and peel off the backing paper again 

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:20.295
 Form a fixed point at the mark at the end of the bandage 

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:24.892
 I will apply these bandages like the one I made for the first time. 

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:29.165
 No tension at the fixed point 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 No tension when applying a bandage 

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.701
 Then pull down, the purpose of my doing is to 

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.575
 Make a box for pain points 

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:47.140
 The third piece is still tearing off a type I bandage, this time. 

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:50.620
 I will tear the back paper in the middle of the bandage. 

00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:57.220
 Peel off the backing paper, leaving 11⁄2-2 feet away from the fixed point 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.600
 At this time, I have to apply uniform tension in the middle part. 

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:10.700
 Or fully stretch the bandage in the middle 

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:12.600
 Stick it on this pain point 

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:16.520
 Trim the fixed point when I hang down from the fixed point 

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:21.870
 Make sure there is no tension at the fixed point at the end of the bandage 

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:24.530
 Do the same thing on the back 

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:30.000
 Remove the backing paper, the bandage has no tension when the fixing point is attached 

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:33.120
 And turn your arm back to the bend 

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:36.160
 This is a way to stick your rib pain points.
