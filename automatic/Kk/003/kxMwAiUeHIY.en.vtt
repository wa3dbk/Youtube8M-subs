00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.790
 He does this every time 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.770
 what your bank stays on for example 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 the same place but your seat 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.440
 moves and that is for this 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.440
 boy no problem 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.760
 it takes those text system recognizes 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.550
 extra contaminated pieces 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.270
 jacket he puts on there in that extra place 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.580
 hard your best 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.580
 so that it is also columns and clean 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.390
 this a robot that has a trap 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.000
 protection and those are all 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.490
 sensors on the bottom that when you turn on 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.140
 the edge of the stairs also recognizes that 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.360
 so that will never drive off 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 he also has a crashed security 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.230
 so if you get stuck under something then 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.760
 he goes a bit moving like that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.740
 tries to release himself again and 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360
 if that fails then it will itself 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.940
 just turn it off so that it does n't work 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.620
 damaged also recognized those tassels there 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.690
 of the carpet and the threads because on it 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.970
 moment that it is sucking and it is going 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.190
 in here and says he wanted to 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170
 in then he turns the other way until 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.470
 spit team just back off and he 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.600
 further 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.850
 but that remained the soft touch 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.080
 bumper is an important part of it 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.790
 this vacuum cleaner 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.250
 he could come at full speed 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.170
 then he can see what is there 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.330
 goes in very gently and the 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.920
 looks need is a heart object 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.080
 and then it runs young the moment it 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.950
 soft objects such as here 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.600
 under the couch 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.860
 then you can just go under because there 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.860
 always has the most dust 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.410
 the exhaust air and from this vacuum cleaner 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.670
 goes through the hepa filter especially for 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.670
 people with dust allergies 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.720
 this is the virtual lighthouse and that 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.720
 has two functions 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.030
 because with this switch you determine what 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.460
 he does or the lighthouse 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.590
 whether you choose the wool with the virtual role 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.720
 the space where you are not allowed 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.880
 do you use the lighthouse function then 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.800
 takes place between two rooms in the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.110
 room now vacuuming is 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.210
 must then first wonder how before going to 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.979
 the other room may have a multiple 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.440
 rooms that have delimited or one 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.550
 give priority is this product 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.389
 naturally optional 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.389
 extra available with us 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.340
 do you have a specific place where you 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.260
 wish he could not like for example 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.780
 the water basin edges around 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.789
 if they have a virtual halo then comes 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.330
 that in a circle of half a meter there 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.330
 never 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.320
 this is the charging station of this irobot 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.210
 This vacuum cleaner can be used in three ways 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.100
 to clean 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.270
 through the schedule what you own 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.640
 composes 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.010
 the means of this push of a button then 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.410
 that one just starts cleaning or 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.730
 through sportswear 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.770
 you can program one through 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.540
 this touch control can be used every day 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.070
 the week and set itself rolls on 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.880
 Monday I want you to find one 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.130

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.750
 Tuesday not at all and for example on 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.430
 Wednesday when I am sleeping 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.410
 do you want it to be just the house 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.160
 you only need to make this 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.930
 pressing green button 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.310
 it also has spot cleaning 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.620
 if you dropped something 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.750
 then you put it and down there and in one 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.290
 he makes a radius of one and a half meters 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.290
 then all clean 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.780
 Also this vacuum cleaner has a handle 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.370
 doctors easy prey m somewhere 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.720
 otherwise want to drop for example as 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.610
 you want it to be cleaned upstairs 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.890
 also handy of this machine is that 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.800
 indicates when the waste container is full 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.690
 that can be opened with the tab then can 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.270
 you can easily find an empty one 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.700
 he also has two hepa filters in it 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.070
 sit then the back 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.020
 He goes up and down diagonally and together with 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.030
 those the wheels that learn and on those so 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.580
 he also has one over the thresholds 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.770
 side brush so before that in all 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.360
 corners and also ideal for 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.160
 along the baseboards and it's a smart one 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.840
 boy because he will take care of the other 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.520
 this side where the mussel is 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.890
 along the baseboards this boy has 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.450
 it two brushes and in combination with 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.790
 he makes sure that it is sucking 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.410
 all good in the bin, the 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.520
 you can easily clean the brushes 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.110
 two tabs 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.440
 then we do we get up the 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.360
 brush out a rio then you get after 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.860
 heavy included 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.140
 that you also make this brush equally easy 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.910
 can clean all hair out 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.320
 and the steering wheel maintenance is important 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.490
 because that way with this young in 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.500
 top condition 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.700
 the brushes are on after a while 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.710
 replacement 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.960
 and of course also the hepa filter and we 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.060
 recommend that at least one 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.740
 times a year and these accessories are 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.050
 of course available with us 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.910
 we recommend a discount counter for vacuum cleaning 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.980
 okay that is occasionally the caster 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.960
 to take off and briefly and neatly 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.920
 clean up when her i 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.990
 get stuck in between 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.300
 you get with the box and don't forget 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.590
 to remove this yellow tab then it is 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.360
 ready for use 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.740
 but then you first have 16 hours 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.630
 load 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.500
 because an item is the maximum from you 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.910
