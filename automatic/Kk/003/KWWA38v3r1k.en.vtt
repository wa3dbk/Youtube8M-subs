00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
market in terms of speed right need to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.840 
market in terms of speed right need to
pay

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.070 
going to be almost equal to the iphone 5
but<00:03:03.160> in<00:03:03.190> terms<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.390> build<00:03:04.570> quality<00:03:04.780> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
but in terms of the build quality and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.810 
but in terms of the build quality and
style<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.770> didn't<00:03:06.040> think<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> they<00:03:06.460> can<00:03:06.520> beat

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
style I didn't think that they can beat

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.980 
style I didn't think that they can beat
this<00:03:07.060> thing<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:08.200> secondly<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:09.810> iphone<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.900> a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
this thing and secondly the iphone is a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.190 
this thing and secondly the iphone is a
very<00:03:11.140> strong<00:03:11.380> market<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.690> was<00:03:14.050> pretty

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
very strong market so that was pretty

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.030 
very strong market so that was pretty
much<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> very<00:03:14.800> simple<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.840> very<00:03:17.320> clear<00:03:17.680> fact

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
much it very simple a very clear fact

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.370 
much it very simple a very clear fact
about<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.580> speed<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.180> iphone<00:03:19.570> 5<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.200> is

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
press the buttons on both of them but

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.580 
press the buttons on both of them but
you<00:04:37.940> have<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.210> know<00:04:38.240> one<00:04:38.510> thing<00:04:38.540> this<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.380> new

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
you have to know one thing this is a new

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.130 
you have to know one thing this is a new
processor<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.130> this<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.400> old<00:04:40.520> processor

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
processor and this is the old processor

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:52.559 
processor and this is the old processor
right<00:04:42.140> one<00:04:42.740> two<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.280> three<00:04:48.130> no<00:04:49.130> don't<00:04:49.430> click

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.589 

it's<00:04:53.169> taking<00:04:53.499> its<00:04:53.649> time<00:04:53.830> right<00:04:54.669> much<00:04:55.389> faster

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
it's taking its time right much faster

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:02.419 
it's taking its time right much faster
now<00:04:56.279> we're<00:04:57.279> going<00:04:57.399> to<00:04:57.490> click<00:04:57.669> on<00:04:57.789> motors

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:02.429 

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:06.709 

almost<00:05:03.429> equal<00:05:03.819> I<00:05:04.289> want<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.379> click<00:05:05.499> on

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
almost equal I want to click on

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:13.680 
almost equal I want to click on
motorcycles<00:05:07.719> scooters<00:05:07.899> now

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.250 

this<00:05:14.690> time<00:05:14.990> look<00:05:15.500> how<00:05:15.650> was<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> bit<00:05:15.980> faster<00:05:17.260> it

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
this time look how was a bit faster it

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.200 
this time look how was a bit faster it
basically<00:05:18.530> depends<00:05:19.130> on<00:05:19.250> bond<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.610> 3g<00:05:19.880> signal

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
basically depends on bond the 3g signal

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.190 
basically depends on bond the 3g signal
birth<00:05:20.750> now<00:05:21.620> i'm<00:05:21.650> going<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.370> click<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:23.200> BSA

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
birth now i'm going to click on BSA

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:33.519 
birth now i'm going to click on BSA
let's<00:05:24.620> see<00:05:24.770> how<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:24.980> performs

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.519 

look<00:05:34.189> at<00:05:34.369> searching<00:05:34.759> right<00:05:35.509> I'm<00:05:36.229> going<00:05:36.439> to

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
look at searching right I'm going to

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.249 
look at searching right I'm going to
click<00:05:36.679> on<00:05:36.829> the<00:05:36.919> same<00:05:37.099> motorcycle<00:05:37.689> and<00:05:38.689> let's

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
click on the same motorcycle and let's

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:46.800 
click on the same motorcycle and let's
see<00:05:39.469> how<00:05:39.979> they<00:05:40.159> perform<00:05:40.279> on<00:05:41.089> the<00:05:41.239> picture

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.140 

the<00:05:47.380> item<00:05:47.620> description<00:05:47.650> came<00:05:48.250> in<00:05:48.430> first<00:05:48.730> but

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
the item description came in first but

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.610 
the item description came in first but
is<00:05:49.330> taking<00:05:49.630> time<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.900> load<00:05:50.050> of<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.260> picture

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
is taking time to load of the picture

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.400 
is taking time to load of the picture
the<00:05:51.250> picture<00:05:51.400> came<00:05:51.700> in<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.360> iphone<00:05:52.660> 5<00:05:52.870> first

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
the picture came in the iphone 5 first

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.320 
the picture came in the iphone 5 first
so<00:05:54.100> there<00:05:54.250> was<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.400> bit<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.669> difference<00:05:54.910> in

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
so there was a bit of difference in

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.070 
so there was a bit of difference in
loading<00:05:55.600> graphics<00:05:56.700> well<00:05:57.700> in<00:05:57.910> terms<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.660> 3g

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
loading graphics well in terms of 3g

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.990 
loading graphics well in terms of 3g
there<00:05:59.500> is<00:05:59.620> difference<00:06:00.040> iphone<00:06:00.639> 5<00:06:00.850> is

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
there is difference iphone 5 is

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.390 
there is difference iphone 5 is
definitely<00:06:01.480> a<00:06:01.510> faster<00:06:01.960> phone<00:06:02.130> so<00:06:03.130> i<00:06:03.160> think

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
definitely a faster phone so i think

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.740 
definitely a faster phone so i think
apple<00:06:03.730> is<00:06:03.970> quite<00:06:04.360> right<00:06:04.600> slimmer<00:06:05.290> faster
