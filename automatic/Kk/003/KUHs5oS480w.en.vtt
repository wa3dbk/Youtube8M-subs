 close 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.320
 on the one hand the plants cut the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.720
 Plants that remain in the water lapse 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 we do not want that to another 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 Absaugung that means I go with that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 Dive into the water and only under 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 suck water and suck the third 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 in the spring also the fixed why and how 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.770
 I am through America through my wife 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.360

 She has also been building ponds for decades 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.340
 and it just worked out well 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.380

 why now in the fall a treatment 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.560
 The condition of a water is always 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.150
 One question above all is the nutrient balance 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.309
 in the fall, a maximum arises 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.080
 organic material on leaves the ins 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.150
 algae get water from the she 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010
 deny they make bad ones 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.690
 Mud is made rot and at 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.400
 Next , nutrients start again 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.350
 to dissolve back into the water body 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.330
 through the entry of effective 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.150
 microorganisms can do the following 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.040
 be stopped and organic 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.320
 material to be metabolized better 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 and how to get treatment in 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.759
 autumn with e mails exactly from wm active

 Ceramic inspectors become one with each other 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.680
 it can mix and use energy 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.630
 with hole tower especially in the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 border zones and in the plant kingdom 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 spread 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.770
 and now there's a tip from 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:51.410
 profi aquatic plants at the bottom 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.620
 cut off these extraterrestrial plants 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.550
 ten inches above the water level 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.770
 and how effective microorganisms 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.540
 or what advantages do you have in 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.900
