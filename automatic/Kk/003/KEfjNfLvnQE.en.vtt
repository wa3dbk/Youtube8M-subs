00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.620
 would like to do together with the dog 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.630
 but also together with people 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
 then it is sometimes not so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 simply because many joggers or nordic 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 For example, walkers do not even walk in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 they may have their rows 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 ever made bad experiences 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.699
 because an unangelein dog selected her 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 or even hunted or you can 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.350
 not properly concentrate so ours 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 Tip would be that then just what 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 takes because you can lend the dog and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 can still run with these substances 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.270
 you need your hands free for the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 city ​​and there are actually 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 possibilities nordic walking with dog 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.180
 and to make nice with athletes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.180
 we show an example from bonn 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 what are these people doing? 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.329
 to meet a parking lot 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 Everyone has a different reason 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 it aching shoulder a couple of times 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.420
 kilos too much 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.840
 but all have a dog of the demanded 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840
 wants to be 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.790
 they are expected by ben and manuela 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.870
 x6 is the first and so far only 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.060
 nordic walking trainer in germany 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 the halter and dog trained together 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.910
 The equipment pieces and linen presents 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.200
 for the beginning the trainer 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.980
 to keep your hands free 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.540
 she leash a belly 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.810
 who does not fit fast why too 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.200
 always 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.119
 he gets a leash for his wrist 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.570
 Disadvantage sees the dog becomes the stick 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.570
 entrained 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.160
 first warm up is announced and the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.160
 dogs are allowed to let off steam 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.429
 then follows the first lesson in nordic 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.360
 walking technique rights hand to hand 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.840
 due date 1 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.329
 I go and behind hips opens 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.060
 the hand and relies on this 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.599
 thumb off so that I get the swing 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.330
 get back up front here come first 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.959
 doubt on whether the dog with it's 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.110
 not better 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.310
 So the whole thing is the technique of walking 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.680
 set of round 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 no if a dog has a certain 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.079
 does not have to have a lead now 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 be perfect, you can stand on your 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.829
 Strength concentrate what you still 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.450
 It can happen that the dog is the one 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.130
 Of course, in the sticks at the beginning 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.540
 but that happens, too 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.500
 You can start the technique then you catch 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.500
 also from the beginning 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.750
 and I think that may have some 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.519
 I think that's awesome too 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.209
 learn at the same time your dog too 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.040
 also handle the problems to see 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.870
 instead of lingering grew together where I did 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.609
 It can be great now 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.510
 my dog ​​comes into play and the power 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.510
 everything broke me 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.280
 and then we finally start on stock 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280
 and stone 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.800
 Manuela Dix and Ben are one 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.720
 rehearsed team 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.940
 but it also works with the beginners 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.850
 surprisingly good no tangle in 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.440
 the leash no jump in the sticks 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.540
 the biggest problem is nature 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 of the dog he likes to stay 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:52.390
 stand and sniff 300 understand that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.330
 I'm going all the time but now 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.880
 is really going to run 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 even nasal animals are 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.880
 habit animals 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.950
 after an hour , the first one inclines 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.780
 It's the end of the day at about seven 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.730
 a beginner needs a lesson 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.670
 Nordic walking technique to master 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.579
 for today is the target reaches the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.579
 Dogs are exhausted and people are 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.120
 you always think if you watch it 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.580
 as an outsider is very easy 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.590
 but then also the pieces that are allowed 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.910
 do not grind aha okay the action 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.040
 be easy the dog is now once 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.199
 back in the way so many things are on 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.360
 you have to pay attention and always one 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.789
 challenge the first 20 minutes 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.229
 the hand is complicated but i think so 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.930
 then because it makes too crazy one 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.389
 think too much hands and grind and 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.990
 dog and and therefore and when her place was 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.919
 like kings almost everything by itself 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.990
 Euro end he no longer needs 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.080
 Great move, they are all flat 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 as I see it 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.970
 Thanks a lot until next week 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.750
 if it is called again to the pieces 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.030
 ready go 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.400
 all participants want to come back to 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.610
 you and your dogs are really too 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.610
 demand 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.380
 he is also a great thing and does 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.380
 all well
