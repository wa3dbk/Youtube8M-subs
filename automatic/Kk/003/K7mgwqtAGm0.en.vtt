they<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:12.000> look<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> same

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
they kind of don't look like the same
colors<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> most<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
colors I think the most the one that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
colors I think the most the one that
looks<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> most<00:01:15.570> similar<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:17.040> which

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
looks the most similar is that one which

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
looks the most similar is that one which
is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> wet<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.119> wild<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.200> ones

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
is the wet and wild one the other ones

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
is the wet and wild one the other ones
are<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.250> darker<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
are a little bit darker like that's a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
are a little bit darker like that's a
little<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.110> more<00:01:22.259> darker<00:01:22.710> purple<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.490> shirt

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
