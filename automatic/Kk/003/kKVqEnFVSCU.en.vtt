00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.130 
hours a day and melt as much ice as
possible<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.430> it's<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.180> way<00:01:04.299> to<00:01:04.360> look<00:01:04.600> at<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
possible and it's a way to look at the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.350 
possible and it's a way to look at the
interactions<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.100> atmosphere<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.909> ocean

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
interactions of the atmosphere the ocean

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
interactions of the atmosphere the ocean
and<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.200> Earth's<00:01:08.380> surface<00:01:08.920> itself<00:01:09.430> we're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
and the the Earth's surface itself we're

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.390 
and the the Earth's surface itself we're
measuring<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.960> water<00:01:11.770> flowing<00:01:12.250> by

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
measuring the water flowing by

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.690 
measuring the water flowing by
continuously<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.600> we<00:01:13.750> get<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.409> dust<00:01:14.979> record<00:01:15.430> and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
continuously so we get a dust record and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.820 
continuously so we get a dust record and
a<00:01:15.820> conductivity<00:01:16.300> record<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.049> both<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.740> those

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
a conductivity record and both of those

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.280 
a conductivity record and both of those
things<00:01:18.159> have<00:01:18.729> an<00:01:18.880> annual<00:01:19.180> variation<00:01:19.930> in<00:01:20.110> them

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
things have an annual variation in them

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.649 
things have an annual variation in them
and<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:21.130> those<00:01:21.280> wiggly<00:01:21.880> lines<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.299> can<00:01:22.450> see

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
and so in those wiggly lines we can see

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
and so in those wiggly lines we can see
an<00:01:22.840> annual<00:01:23.370> signal<00:01:24.370> kind<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.330> like<00:01:25.479> tree<00:01:25.690> rings

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
an annual signal kind of like tree rings

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.630 
an annual signal kind of like tree rings
we<00:01:27.159> can't<00:01:27.370> really<00:01:27.490> see<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.360> ice<00:01:28.630> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
we can't really see that in this ice but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.740 
we can't really see that in this ice but
but<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.760> we<00:01:30.880> look<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.180> chemistry<00:01:31.600> that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
but as we look at the chemistry that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.750 
but as we look at the chemistry that
comes<00:01:31.960> out<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.320> ice<00:01:32.440> we<00:01:32.830> can<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.549> see

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
comes out of the ice we can we can see

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.570 
comes out of the ice we can we can see
that<00:01:33.940> annual<00:01:34.450> record<00:01:34.810> I'm<00:01:35.530> going<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> turn

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
that annual record I'm going to turn

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.810 
that annual record I'm going to turn
the<00:01:36.850> pump<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.680> we<00:01:38.710> have<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> clean<00:01:39.280> lab<00:01:39.460> where<00:01:39.790> we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
the pump so we have a clean lab where we

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.440 
the pump so we have a clean lab where we
melt<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.750> ice<00:01:40.960> core<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:42.370> ice<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.760> melted<00:01:43.150> from

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
melt the ice core the ice is melted from

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.780 
melt the ice core the ice is melted from
one<00:01:43.750> end<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> other<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.620> a<00:01:44.680> hot<00:01:44.980> plate<00:01:45.160> you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
one end to the other on a hot plate you

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.030 
one end to the other on a hot plate you
can<00:01:45.940> hear<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.240> sound<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.230> core<00:01:47.530> it's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
can hear the sound of the core it's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.649 
can hear the sound of the core it's
pretty<00:01:48.340> neat<00:01:48.580> as<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.880> as<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.290> ice<00:01:50.590> melts

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.899 

and<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.829> water<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.219> pulled<00:01:55.490> through<00:01:55.729> that

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
and and the water is pulled through that

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.480 
and and the water is pulled through that
plate<00:01:56.240> allowing<00:01:56.750> us<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.530> inside<00:01:58.189> of

the ice core without ever having the

the ice core without ever having the
outer<00:02:01.490> part<00:02:02.680> contaminate<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.710> inner<00:02:04.039> part

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
outer part contaminate that inner part

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.219 
outer part contaminate that inner part
of<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.909> core<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.630> ice<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.079> we're

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
of the core for the ice that we're

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.290 
of the core for the ice that we're
melting<00:02:06.560> today<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:07.039> single<00:02:07.670> year<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.149> about

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
melting today a single year is about

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.460 
melting today a single year is about
this<00:02:08.569> much<00:02:08.630> ice<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.599> imagine<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
this much ice and so if you imagine the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.290 
this much ice and so if you imagine the
stuff<00:02:13.040> we're<00:02:13.220> measuring<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.849> really<00:02:14.120> high

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
stuff we're measuring on a really high

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.110 
stuff we're measuring on a really high
resolution<00:02:14.860> through<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.040> year<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.790> see

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
resolution through that year we can see

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
resolution through that year we can see
changes<00:02:17.959> happening<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.739> actually<00:02:19.099> figure

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
changes happening and actually figure

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.190 
changes happening and actually figure
out<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:19.580> season<00:02:20.239> these<00:02:20.690> changes<00:02:21.080> are

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
out what season these changes are

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.080 
out what season these changes are
happening<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:22.310> reconstruct<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
happening you can reconstruct the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.089 
happening you can reconstruct the
temperature<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.780> Earth<00:02:23.959> or<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.680> local

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
temperature of Earth or the local

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.009 
temperature of Earth or the local
regional<00:02:25.670> temperature<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.480> Antarctic

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
regional temperature so Antarctic

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.949 
regional temperature so Antarctic
temperature<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.239> reconstruct<00:02:29.599> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
temperature you can reconstruct the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.110 
temperature you can reconstruct the
strength<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.410> winds<00:02:30.830> or<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.459> strength<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
strength of the winds or the strength of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.370 
strength of the winds or the strength of
the<00:02:32.180> atmospheric<00:02:32.690> circulation<00:02:33.290> around

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
the atmospheric circulation around

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.130 
the atmospheric circulation around
Antarctica<00:02:34.090> we<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.239> see<00:02:35.630> volcanic

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
Antarctica we also see volcanic

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.199 
Antarctica we also see volcanic
eruptions<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.830> actually<00:02:37.160> today<00:02:37.310> will<00:02:38.030> be

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
eruptions and actually today will be

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.320 
eruptions and actually today will be
melting<00:02:38.959> ice<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.470> may<00:02:40.010> show<00:02:40.340> evidence<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:41.120> an

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
melting ice that may show evidence of an

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.120 
melting ice that may show evidence of an
ancient<00:02:41.569> volcanic<00:02:42.140> eruption<00:02:42.739> which<00:02:42.890> would<00:02:43.010> be

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
ancient volcanic eruption which would be

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.059 
ancient volcanic eruption which would be
very<00:02:43.340> exciting

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.630 

so<00:02:47.579> these<00:02:47.700> are<00:02:47.879> top<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.480> arrows<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.219> top<00:02:50.459> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so these are top up arrows so the top of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.759 
so these are top up arrows so the top of
the<00:02:50.700> core<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.599> melt<00:02:51.780> top<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the core is here and we melt top to

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.190 
the core is here and we melt top to
bottom<00:02:52.969> and<00:02:53.969> that<00:02:54.090> way<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.569> connect<00:02:54.959> all

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
bottom and that way we can connect all

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.809 
bottom and that way we can connect all
the<00:02:55.409> segments<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.069> ice<00:02:56.189> because<00:02:56.489> they're<00:02:56.700> in

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the segments of ice because they're in

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.539 
the segments of ice because they're in
one<00:02:57.000> meter<00:02:57.209> segments<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.250> create<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> long

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
one meter segments and create a long

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.979 
one meter segments and create a long
record<00:03:03.470> -20<00:03:04.470> C<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.269> much<00:03:06.390> colder<00:03:06.780> than<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
record -20 C now that much colder than a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.080 
record -20 C now that much colder than a
typical<00:03:07.859> winter<00:03:07.950> day<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.250> Maine<00:03:08.579> but<00:03:08.790> still

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
typical winter day in Maine but still

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.360 
typical winter day in Maine but still
cold<00:03:09.390> enough<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.659> suit<00:03:10.019> up

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.869 

I<00:03:17.430> am<00:03:18.090> prepping<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.049> course<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.310> melt<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.819> I

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
I am prepping the course to to melt so I

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.490 
I am prepping the course to to melt so I
need<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.239> clean<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.780> ends<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.260> course

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
need to clean the ends of the course

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.580 
need to clean the ends of the course
there<00:03:23.430> might<00:03:23.580> be<00:03:23.610> some<00:03:23.879> dust<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.590> particles

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
there might be some dust or particles

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.890 
there might be some dust or particles
that<00:03:25.980> have<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:26.220> sort<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.519> stuck<00:03:26.909> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.569> ends

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
that have just sort of stuck on the ends

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.369 
that have just sort of stuck on the ends
so<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.500> scrape<00:03:28.799> those<00:03:29.010> off<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.110> get<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.260> ice

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
so I scrape those off and get the ice

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.850 
so I scrape those off and get the ice
into<00:03:31.620> its<00:03:31.830> core<00:03:32.069> try<00:03:32.390> these<00:03:33.390> are<00:03:33.860> ceramic

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
into its core try these are ceramic

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.280 
into its core try these are ceramic
blades<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.450> they<00:03:36.569> should<00:03:36.750> not<00:03:36.900> contaminate

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
blades so they should not contaminate

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.890 
blades so they should not contaminate
the<00:03:37.709> chemistry<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> core<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:39.629> clean

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
the chemistry of the core and we clean

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.280 
the chemistry of the core and we clean
them<00:03:40.079> every<00:03:40.170> day<00:03:41.209> everything<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:43.140> ice

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
them every day everything in the ice

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
them every day everything in the ice
core<00:03:43.590> world<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.159> very<00:03:45.000> sensitive<00:03:45.569> because

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
core world is very sensitive because

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.940 
core world is very sensitive because
these<00:03:46.019> are<00:03:46.200> pristine<00:03:47.390> records<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.599> ancient

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
these are pristine records of ancient

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.009 
these are pristine records of ancient
atmospheric<00:03:49.950> chemistry<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.569> we<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
atmospheric chemistry and we have to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:52.819 
atmospheric chemistry and we have to
treat<00:03:52.230> them<00:03:52.379> that<00:03:52.440> way

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
treat them that way

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.960 
treat them that way
I<00:03:53.629> mean<00:03:54.629> I'm<00:03:54.780> helping<00:03:55.440> best<00:03:55.680> track<00:03:56.459> volcanic

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
I mean I'm helping best track volcanic

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.390 
I mean I'm helping best track volcanic
eruptions<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.859> Antarctic<00:03:58.859> ice<00:03:58.950> core<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
eruptions in Antarctic ice core that

eruptions in Antarctic ice core that
spans<00:03:59.670> back<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.359> 2300<00:04:01.200> years<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.709> mean<00:04:02.220> where

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
spans back to 2300 years I mean where

else am I going to get experience like

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.809 
else am I going to get experience like

we actually had a really interesting

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.990 
we actually had a really interesting

conversation out in West Antarctica the
fact<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.360> we're<00:04:12.569> taking<00:04:12.810> about<00:04:13.560> two<00:04:13.980> miles

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
fact that we're taking about two miles

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.210 
fact that we're taking about two miles
of<00:04:14.489> ice<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.320> slowly<00:04:16.320> drilling<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> over<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
of ice and slowly drilling it over the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.250 
of ice and slowly drilling it over the
course<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.579> three<00:04:17.880> years<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.540> then<00:04:18.780> melting

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
course of three years and then melting

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.379 
course of three years and then melting
it<00:04:19.350> all<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.709> then<00:04:19.799> analyzing<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:20.579> it's

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
it all and then analyzing it all it's

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.150 
it all and then analyzing it all it's
such<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> huge<00:04:22.139> project<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.950> can't

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
such a huge project that you can't

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.230 
such a huge project that you can't
really<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.850> all<00:04:24.060> at<00:04:24.240> once<00:04:25.940> it's<00:04:26.940> like<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
really see it all at once it's like you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.150 
really see it all at once it's like you
have<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.480> walk<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.169> distance<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.740> two<00:04:28.770> miles

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
have to walk the distance of two miles

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.610 
have to walk the distance of two miles
to<00:04:29.490> understand<00:04:29.880> how<00:04:30.060> much<00:04:30.210> ice<00:04:30.389> there<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.900> it's

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
to understand how much ice there is it's

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.200 
to understand how much ice there is it's
just<00:04:31.710> astonishing<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.550> think<00:04:32.760> about<00:04:32.970> what<00:04:33.120> was

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
just astonishing to think about what was

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.640 
just astonishing to think about what was
happening<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.720> world<00:04:33.870> at<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.050> time<00:04:34.200> and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
happening in the world at that time and

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.850 
happening in the world at that time and
the<00:04:35.070> fact<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:36.000> ice<00:04:36.240> records<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:37.260> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the fact that this ice records the the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.830 
the fact that this ice records the the
snow<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.310> fell<00:04:38.520> at<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.450> time<00:04:39.660> in

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
snow that fell at that time in

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:50.610 
snow that fell at that time in
Antarctica

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620
