most recent minecraft snapshot 14 w 18 I
was<00:00:06.779> messing<00:00:06.930> around<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.259> little<00:00:07.350> bit<00:00:07.529> more

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
was messing around a little bit more

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.709 
was messing around a little bit more
with<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> piston<00:00:08.400> slime<00:00:08.820> block<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.389> on<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.599> so

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
with the piston slime block so on and so

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.509 
with the piston slime block so on and so
forth<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.290> put<00:00:10.800> together<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.309> little

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
forth and put together this little

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.459 
forth and put together this little
conveyor<00:00:12.030> belt<00:00:12.300> contraption<00:00:12.840> let<00:00:12.990> me<00:00:13.049> demo<00:00:13.290> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
conveyor belt contraption let me demo it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.379 
conveyor belt contraption let me demo it
for<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.740> real<00:00:13.920> quick<00:00:13.950> place<00:00:14.940> block<00:00:15.210> down

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
for you real quick place block down

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.870 
for you real quick place block down
right<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.170> off<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> goes<00:00:17.160> down<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> line

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
right here and off it goes down the line

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820 
right here and off it goes down the line
up<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> next<00:00:18.750> level<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> next

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
up to the next level and up to the next

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.890 
up to the next level and up to the next
level<00:00:19.949> until<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> reaches<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.910> end<00:00:21.119> point<00:00:21.420> at

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
level until it reaches the end point at

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
level until it reaches the end point at
which<00:00:22.020> point<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> doesn't<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.250> do

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
which point it doesn't really do

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
which point it doesn't really do
anything<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.029> still<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> thought<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> pretty

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
anything but still I thought is pretty

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
anything but still I thought is pretty
cool<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.680> pushes<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> block<00:00:26.400> along<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
cool you know pushes the block along and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
cool you know pushes the block along and
then<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.630> pushes<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> next<00:00:28.619> level<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
then it pushes up to the next level it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
then it pushes up to the next level it
keeps<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.570> cool<00:00:30.720> part

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
keeps going on and on and the cool part

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
keeps going on and on and the cool part
about<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> totally<00:00:32.070> modular<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> can

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
about this is totally modular so you can

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.370 
about this is totally modular so you can
go<00:00:33.329> into<00:00:33.450> mcedit<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.230> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
go into mcedit and you can just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.090 
go into mcedit and you can just
copy/paste

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
copy/paste

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.450 
copy/paste
apart<00:00:35.700> over<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.170> next<00:00:37.440> area<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.010> keep

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
apart over to the next area and you keep

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040 
apart over to the next area and you keep
this<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.030> forever<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this going on forever you can have it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
this going on forever you can have it
drop<00:00:40.469> back<00:00:40.680> down<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.489> although<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
drop back down if you want although that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.810 
drop back down if you want although that
would<00:00:42.750> call<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.260> reversal<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
would call for a reversal of the the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
would call for a reversal of the the
push<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.180> mechanism<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> push<00:00:46.710> down

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
push up mechanism to be a push down

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
push up mechanism to be a push down
mechanism<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.700> again<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.420> wouldn't<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.719> too

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
mechanism but again that wouldn't be too

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
mechanism but again that wouldn't be too
difficult<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.430> works<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
difficult so the way this works is it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000 
difficult so the way this works is it
combined<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.170> couple<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.739> simple

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
combined just a couple of really simple

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
combined just a couple of really simple
modules<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.510> pushes<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> block

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
modules and then it pushes the block

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
modules and then it pushes the block
along<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.340> pulls<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> block<00:00:57.090> along

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
along with them or pulls the block along

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
along with them or pulls the block along
I<00:00:57.570> should<00:00:57.600> say<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I should say so the first one is the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
I should say so the first one is the
actual<00:00:59.520> pulling<00:01:00.300> mechanism<00:01:00.559> super<00:01:01.559> simple<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
actual pulling mechanism super simple it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
actual pulling mechanism super simple it
just<00:01:02.820> takes<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> clock<00:01:03.390> ticking<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
just takes a clock ticking back and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.730 
just takes a clock ticking back and
forth<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.760> particular<00:01:06.299> timing<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
forth with this particular timing and it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
forth with this particular timing and it
just<00:01:07.920> fires<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.790> Pistons<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:09.810> one's<00:01:09.990> on

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
just fires the Pistons so when one's on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.580 
just fires the Pistons so when one's on
the<00:01:10.470> other<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.810> vice-versa<00:01:12.810> really

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the other is off at vice-versa really

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
the other is off at vice-versa really
straightforward<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.490> when<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> block

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
straightforward and when I put the block

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
straightforward and when I put the block
down<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.729> gets<00:01:17.939> pulled

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
down over here and it just gets pulled

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
down over here and it just gets pulled
right<00:01:18.360> along<00:01:18.600> until<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> reaches<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.200> end

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
right along until it reaches the end

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.660 
right along until it reaches the end
then<00:01:19.530> it'll<00:01:19.680> oscillate<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.610> forth<00:01:21.560> but

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
then it'll oscillate back and forth but

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.679 
then it'll oscillate back and forth but
getting<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> let<00:01:24.030> me<00:01:24.090> distress<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> block

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
getting it let me distress the block

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
getting it let me distress the block
destroying<00:01:25.439> everything<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> block<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
destroying everything but the block I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.060 
destroying everything but the block I
wanted<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> stray<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> yeah

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
wanted the stray there we go so yeah

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
wanted the stray there we go so yeah
that<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.939> module<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> real<00:01:31.259> simple

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that that's that module a real simple

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
that that's that module a real simple
setup<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> clock<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> couple<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> Pistons

setup a clock put a couple of Pistons

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
setup a clock put a couple of Pistons

down put some slime blocks at the end of
the<00:01:36.659> piston<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.310> off<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.520> goes<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.909> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the piston and off it goes you can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.539 
the piston and off it goes you can
attach<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.540> few<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.229> than<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.430> right

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
attach a few more than that I have right

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
attach a few more than that I have right
here<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> maximum<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.990> do

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
here this is the maximum that you can do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870 
here this is the maximum that you can do
with<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.950> current<00:01:44.220> set<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.579> there<00:01:44.729> may<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
with the the current set up there may be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
with the the current set up there may be
a<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> optimize<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
a way to optimize this and get a little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
a way to optimize this and get a little
bit<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.640> each<00:01:47.729> level<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> don't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
bit more out of each level but I don't

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
bit more out of each level but I don't
know<00:01:49.320> since<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.740> modular<00:01:49.890> anyway<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.640> not

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
know since it's modular anyway it's not

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.969 
know since it's modular anyway it's not
too<00:01:50.909> difficult<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.990> keep<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> copy-pasting

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
too difficult to to keep it copy-pasting

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
too difficult to to keep it copy-pasting
so<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> next<00:01:54.720> part<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.259> do

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so then the next part and you can do

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.940 
so then the next part and you can do
this<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.149> multitude<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.450> different<00:01:57.509> ways<00:01:57.950> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this in a multitude of different ways in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
this in a multitude of different ways in
fact<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.790> probably<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.299> even<00:02:00.390> need

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
fact you you probably don't even need

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.410 
fact you you probably don't even need
the<00:02:00.810> slime<00:02:01.049> block<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> there

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the slime block here I just put it there

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
the slime block here I just put it there
because<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.290> we're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
because you know we're going with the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
because you know we're going with the
theme<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> using<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> slime<00:02:06.030> blocks<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.630> but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
theme of using the slime blocks here but

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.809 
theme of using the slime blocks here but
it<00:02:07.649> does<00:02:07.799> give<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.250> bit<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.550> room

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it does give you a little bit of room

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
it does give you a little bit of room
just<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.899> worried<00:02:10.200> about

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
just so you're not so worried about

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.969 
just so you're not so worried about
having

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
having

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.119 
having
redstone<00:02:11.400> signals<00:02:11.849> cross<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.050> such<00:02:13.379> so

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
redstone signals cross and and such so

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.430 
redstone signals cross and and such so
anyway<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.510> has<00:02:15.629> another<00:02:15.900> clock<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
anyway it just has another clock on the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.220 
anyway it just has another clock on the
exact<00:02:16.739> same<00:02:16.890> timing<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.019> one<00:02:19.019> ends

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
exact same timing here and one ends

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.960 
exact same timing here and one ends
pushing<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.680> signal<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> other<00:02:20.580> piston<00:02:20.849> up

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
pushing a signal to the other piston up

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.610 
pushing a signal to the other piston up
here<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> other<00:02:21.810> end<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:22.260> pushing

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here and the other end just pushing

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.199 
here and the other end just pushing
pushing<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.010> signal<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.879> bottom<00:02:24.060> one

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
pushing a signal to the the bottom one

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.229 
pushing a signal to the the bottom one
and<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.680> needed<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.549> extend<00:02:27.000> up

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
and it's just I needed it to extend up

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.729 
and it's just I needed it to extend up
two<00:02:27.420> blocks<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.200> issue<00:02:28.349> would<00:02:28.620> have

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
two blocks because the issue would have

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.670 
two blocks because the issue would have
been<00:02:29.060> if<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.299> slime<00:02:30.540> blocks<00:02:30.840> were<00:02:31.080> directly

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
been if the slime blocks were directly

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.559 
been if the slime blocks were directly
above<00:02:31.920> what's<00:02:32.580> down<00:02:32.790> here<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.360> wouldn't

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
above what's down here then it wouldn't

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.610 
above what's down here then it wouldn't
it<00:02:33.720> wouldn't<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.110> been<00:02:34.170> able<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.410> move

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it wouldn't have been able to move

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.979 
it wouldn't have been able to move
because<00:02:35.160> they<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.519> be<00:02:35.810> they<00:02:36.810> would<00:02:36.959> be

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
because they would be they would be

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.600 
because they would be they would be
attached<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.920> stuff<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> would<00:02:38.519> be

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
attached to this stuff and it would be

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.039 
attached to this stuff and it would be
over<00:02:38.700> 12<00:02:39.000> blocks<00:02:39.209> it'd<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.599> be<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> mess

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
over 12 blocks it'd just be a mess

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.140 
over 12 blocks it'd just be a mess
wouldn't<00:02:40.440> work<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.370> had<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> two

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
wouldn't work so it had to be a two

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
wouldn't work so it had to be a two
block<00:02:42.360> difference<00:02:43.319> there<00:02:43.470> had<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.799> one

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
block difference there had to be a one

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
block difference there had to be a one
block<00:02:44.129> gap<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.019> that's<00:02:46.140> why<00:02:46.290> there

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
block gap in there so that's why there

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.039 
block gap in there so that's why there
had<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.280> block<00:02:47.489> extension<00:02:48.090> so

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
had to be the the to block extension so

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.270 
had to be the the to block extension so
anyway<00:02:49.859> once<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.790> stone<00:02:51.000> hits<00:02:51.359> this<00:02:51.540> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
anyway once the the stone hits this it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.770 
anyway once the the stone hits this it
gets<00:02:53.280> pushed<00:02:53.519> up<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.910> couple<00:02:54.209> more<00:02:54.450> blocks

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
gets pushed up a couple more blocks

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.300 
gets pushed up a couple more blocks
sometimes<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.379> takes<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.739> back-and-forth

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
sometimes it takes a back-and-forth

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.819 
sometimes it takes a back-and-forth
before<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.209> meets<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.660> timing<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.680> only

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
before it it meets the timing the only

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.069 
before it it meets the timing the only
reason<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.190> timing<00:02:59.609> has<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> yeah<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> have

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
reason the timing has to yeah you have

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.680 
reason the timing has to yeah you have
to<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.980> little<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.250> finicky<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.819> because

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
to it's a little bit finicky is because

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.869 
to it's a little bit finicky is because
the<00:03:03.840> signal<00:03:04.170> has<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.379> be<00:03:04.530> passed<00:03:04.920> through<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
the signal has to be passed through the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.110 
the signal has to be passed through the
slime<00:03:06.090> blocks<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.690> that's<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.650> trick

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
slime blocks here that's the the trick

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.699 
slime blocks here that's the the trick
because<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.450> no<00:03:09.599> real<00:03:09.810> other<00:03:10.079> way<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.349> get

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
because there's no real other way to get

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.559 
because there's no real other way to get
the<00:03:10.859> power<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.609> top<00:03:11.790> piston<00:03:12.180> once<00:03:12.390> it's

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
the power to the top piston once it's

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.759 
the power to the top piston once it's
been<00:03:12.750> moved<00:03:12.930> up<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.650> bit<00:03:13.739> a

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
been moved up so it's a little bit a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.259 
been moved up so it's a little bit a
little<00:03:14.190> bit<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.489> trick<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.879> having<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
little bit of trick are you having the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.720 
little bit of trick are you having the
signal<00:03:15.599> sent<00:03:15.870> through<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.250> slime<00:03:17.250> block<00:03:17.519> but

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
signal sent through the slime block but

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.550 
signal sent through the slime block but
it<00:03:17.819> only<00:03:17.910> works<00:03:18.090> when<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> slime<00:03:18.930> block<00:03:19.169> is<00:03:19.349> is

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it only works when the slime block is is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.190 
it only works when the slime block is is
in<00:03:20.099> place<00:03:20.489> when<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.299> doesn't<00:03:21.810> work<00:03:21.930> when<00:03:22.109> it

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
in place when it doesn't work when it

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.420 
in place when it doesn't work when it
doesn't<00:03:22.470> actually<00:03:22.530> transmit<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.160> signal

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
doesn't actually transmit the signal

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.270 
doesn't actually transmit the signal
when<00:03:23.609> it's<00:03:23.790> like<00:03:24.060> mid<00:03:24.359> movement<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.829> anyway<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
when it's like mid movement so anyway I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.770 
when it's like mid movement so anyway I
just<00:03:26.310> took<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.639> little<00:03:26.730> bit<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.970> playing<00:03:27.569> around

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
just took a little bit of playing around

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
just took a little bit of playing around
with<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.169> signals<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.859> get<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.069> all<00:03:29.160> initiated

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
with the signals to get it all initiated

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000 
with the signals to get it all initiated
and<00:03:29.849> working<00:03:30.120> properly<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:30.750> now<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.799> it's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
and working properly but now that it's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.890 
and working properly but now that it's
it's<00:03:32.609> going<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.930> works<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.370> yeah<00:03:35.819> it<00:03:36.299> should

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
it's going it works so yeah it should

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.020 
it's going it works so yeah it should
work<00:03:37.049> with<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.680> any<00:03:37.829> block<00:03:38.099> except<00:03:38.519> obsidian

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
work with with any block except obsidian

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.180 
work with with any block except obsidian
slime<00:03:39.660> blocks<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.680> redstone<00:03:41.010> block

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
slime blocks and the the redstone block

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
slime blocks and the the redstone block
I<00:03:41.340> think<00:03:41.519> would<00:03:41.639> interfere<00:03:41.910> with<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.269> signal

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
I think would interfere with the signal

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.140 
I think would interfere with the signal
down<00:03:42.780> there<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.260> any<00:03:44.010> ones<00:03:44.250> other<00:03:44.880> than<00:03:44.970> that

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
down there so any ones other than that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.720 
down there so any ones other than that
it<00:03:45.540> should<00:03:45.989> should<00:03:46.560> function<00:03:46.829> properly<00:03:47.430> say

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
it should should function properly say

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.490 
it should should function properly say
let's<00:03:48.060> place<00:03:48.239> down<00:03:48.419> another<00:03:48.690> block<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.319> stone

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
let's place down another block of stone

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.479 
let's place down another block of stone
and<00:03:50.840> watch<00:03:51.840> off<00:03:52.319> it<00:03:52.470> goes<00:03:52.620> down<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> line

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
and watch off it goes down the line

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.599 
and watch off it goes down the line
whoo<00:03:53.849> pretty<00:03:54.720> cool<00:03:54.900> pretty<00:03:55.260> cool<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:56.430> on<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
whoo pretty cool pretty cool and on the

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.920 
whoo pretty cool pretty cool and on the
other<00:03:56.700> hand<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:57.060> could<00:03:57.239> totally<00:03:57.389> simplify

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
other hand you could totally simplify

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.809 
other hand you could totally simplify
this<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.769> want<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.160> use<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.549> sand

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
this if you want to just use like sand

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.339 
this if you want to just use like sand
and<00:03:59.910> gravel<00:04:00.239> for<00:04:00.510> example<00:04:00.870> then<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.079> could

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
and gravel for example then you could

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.400 
and gravel for example then you could
have<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.709> going<00:04:02.609> down<00:04:02.810> instead<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:04.139> and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
have it going down instead of up and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.720 
have it going down instead of up and
obviously<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.950> sand<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.340> gravel<00:04:05.609> would

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
obviously the sand of the gravel would

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.689 
obviously the sand of the gravel would
just<00:04:05.879> fall<00:04:06.180> down<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.810> next<00:04:07.049> level<00:04:07.290> down

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
just fall down to the next level down

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.400 
just fall down to the next level down
and<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.299> would<00:04:09.419> simplify<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.900> there<00:04:10.139> but

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
and and it would simplify it there but

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.890 
and and it would simplify it there but
this<00:04:10.560> works<00:04:11.129> with<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.790> any<00:04:12.000> block<00:04:12.299> for<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
this works with with any block for the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.479 
this works with with any block for the
most<00:04:13.049> part<00:04:13.290> except<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.769> ones<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:14.069> just

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
most part except for the ones I just

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.020 
most part except for the ones I just
outlined<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.359> it's<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.109> bit<00:04:16.260> more<00:04:17.030> universally

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
outlined so it's a bit more universally

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.719 
outlined so it's a bit more universally
applicable<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.859> again<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> whole<00:04:20.519> sand

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
applicable but again that the whole sand

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.399 
applicable but again that the whole sand
and<00:04:20.880> gravel<00:04:21.150> thing<00:04:21.359> can<00:04:21.659> can<00:04:21.930> work<00:04:22.079> as<00:04:22.229> well

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
and gravel thing can can work as well

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.800 
and gravel thing can can work as well
but<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:23.310> wonder<00:04:23.789> with<00:04:24.030> just

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
but I just wonder with just

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.510 
but I just wonder with just
heck<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.260> thought<00:04:25.620> I've<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.830> duplicated<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
heck I thought I've just duplicated the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610 
heck I thought I've just duplicated the
block<00:04:26.730> there<00:04:26.910> really<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.389> was<00:04:27.630> weird

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
block there really that was weird

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.370 
block there really that was weird
yeah<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.280> anyway<00:04:29.370> that's<00:04:30.180> that's<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.600> low

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
yeah so anyway that's that's that low

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.090 
yeah so anyway that's that's that low
conveyor<00:04:32.100> belt<00:04:32.340> for<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:33.350> not<00:04:34.350> exactly<00:04:34.800> sure

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
conveyor belt for you not exactly sure

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.430 
conveyor belt for you not exactly sure
what<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.610> would<00:04:35.790> use<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.510> guess<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
what you would use it for I guess the

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.840 
what you would use it for I guess the
application<00:04:37.980> with<00:04:38.130> sand<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.430> gravel<00:04:38.730> could

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
application with sand and gravel could

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.430 
application with sand and gravel could
be<00:04:38.970> useful<00:04:39.300> because<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.600> can<00:04:39.840> convert<00:04:40.110> sand

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
be useful because you can convert sand

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.740 
be useful because you can convert sand
and<00:04:40.590> gravel<00:04:40.919> back<00:04:41.580> into<00:04:41.940> their<00:04:42.060> their<00:04:42.510> block

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
and gravel back into their their block

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.210 
and gravel back into their their block
form<00:04:43.050> by<00:04:43.169> dropping<00:04:43.500> them<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.710> torch<00:04:44.070> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
form by dropping them on a torch and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.320 
form by dropping them on a torch and
then<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.520> put<00:04:44.610> them<00:04:44.730> into<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:44.910> hopper<00:04:45.300> into

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
then you can put them into a hopper into

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.070 
then you can put them into a hopper into
a<00:04:45.630> chest<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.080> suppose<00:04:46.790> but<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:48.150> know<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.900> cool

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
a chest I suppose but you know it's cool

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.280
