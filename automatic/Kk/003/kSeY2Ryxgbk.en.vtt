long time shut up audio I don't hear it

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.830 
long time shut up audio I don't hear it
the<00:00:08.400> reason<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.820> put<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.150> off<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.660> long

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the reason that I put it off for so long

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.749 
the reason that I put it off for so long
was<00:00:10.050> cuz<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.349> my<00:00:10.500> old<00:00:10.740> recording<00:00:11.400> software<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
was cuz on my old recording software I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.860 
was cuz on my old recording software I
don't<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.330> would<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.540> worked<00:00:12.570> very

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
don't think it would have worked very

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.180 
don't think it would have worked very
well<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.230> think<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.469> would<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.650> lagged<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.040> lot

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
well I think it would have lagged a lot

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.000 
well I think it would have lagged a lot
and<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.549> been<00:00:15.240> pretty<00:00:15.690> much<00:00:15.870> unwatchable<00:00:16.529> hi
