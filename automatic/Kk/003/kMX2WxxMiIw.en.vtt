00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.900
 What you can do, I'll leave it too. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.369
 here playing now with 2 you can 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 do it also when you realize that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.099
 have some frequency that is exposing 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.279
 a little too much 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.779
 is to try to lower it a bit if it is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.520
 Everyone's interest if the musician at the end 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 that way it really could be that he 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.840
 I want it yes but I will give an example to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 you pay attention here has a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:45.470
 frequency is very little here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.900
 O 853 is how I found it really 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.940
 simply was the CONSEA region 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.680
 I think it's around here you go up and get out 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 looking for what you will see in your face 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:10.409
 new that appears with that thanks to water 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 It's a thing then you see that it seems 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 enough here you have more of the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:30.749
 skin but also remembering that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.759
 always if something is already good does not 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:35.039
 move the team that is winning then 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.799
 You 're already listening, it's perfect, no. 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.899
 you have reasons to leave by 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.139
 update an update that is already 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.139
 good 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.920
 here you can search according to the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.439
 the person relaying how often the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.149
 which is but is tuned that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.249
 instrument to enhanced if you want 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.399
 which, for example, I have also looked into 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:58.670
 Tone of 100 is the best here for 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670
 you will see 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.560
 and again if you want to give them a little 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.300
 more stay a little more but close 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.780
 You can increase here so I said that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780
 the old man 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:23.450
 the dish is well you will work more in the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.130
 even picking up a network 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.900
 which gives only in him what happens the first 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.790
 that you can see until you recognize that 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 he will not use a word that helps 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:41.180
 the rest of the battery you have 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 leaking so here I have seen that this is the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.230
 bush around 570 guarantees are 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.090
 deleted because it is not affecting the sound 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 This chimbau you have to remember 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.550
 Thinking about this instrument will not 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:00.740
 fall make a cut then the sound more 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.570
 average of the own that would be more that 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.750
 sound sometimes a soccer hitting the other 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:14.360
 the center now 84 with five stars I 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.920
 I'll give you the best sleep since 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
 they are brighter if the person is 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 wanting more shines in football you 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.980
 can increase by around 13 up to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.540
 truth from there will already give more 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:32.060
 Then brightness will increase teacher and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:34.180
 also increase others and you have 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.180
 what 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.410
 there is a clear realization that new 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:51.080
 remembering the exaggerated but for you to have 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:57.310
 a notion here the over left of 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.310
 other work that only she is sunny and 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.720
 clouds 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.190
 I also want one for the serious ones. 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.510
 do not get caught up in 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.030
 Select only you can see that you can 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:14.870
 listen to the drums so I'm going to kill a 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.410
 pregnant here for me to look like 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:26.090
 really more the dishes and then the rest 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.260
 It's really, uh, it's the same 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 football thing you can select 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:42.490
 five augmented cars want but new 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:45.080
 that would be much more does not give 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:51.020
 anything sharp but you fiddle 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.400
 here will affect then the overs really 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.650
 wanting to eliminate this battle, I do not know 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.900
 sure as I 'm digging your bomb 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.540
 You'll want to kill the hardest part. 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.120
 Sorry for not walking and I wanted to 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.340
 really show it playing touch take 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.490
 all from the sun and make some changes 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.740
 that what I have done of updates 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.510
 What I did here for you. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.920
 listen well then let's go 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.920
 the first to start in the world 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:46.219
 we took the load already looked more will 

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:54.800
 react to not touch the quote of the rec 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:57.019
 He'll appear more, but I will. 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.379
 leave here for now just for you 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:10.550
 they go to see something that they took 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:13.509
 is leaking new performance of the show already 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.509
 stayed the tone 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.890
 so it's kind of like this, I hope 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.440
 that you have come to have a sense that 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.530
 each frequency makes around the parts 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.580
 battery and remember to use the term one 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.940
 video so yes I'm showing 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.220
 some things that are affected but 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.070
 You'll see if it really is. 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.050
 I need to say take this 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.120
 for example here on the battery 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:04.090
 that I said I showed the battery how 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:06.850
 you leave the soil here in the box by 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:11.740
 example I showed how how you leave 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.270
 depending more mat will but the 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.160
 sometimes you take a battery that is 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.860
 the sound of a treadmill and of course actually 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.650
 standing out and tatÃ¡ much then you 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.870
 can actually pick up and even download this 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:28.720
 often the same way as when the 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.660
 increase here will also decrease 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.310
 now here is the battery more 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:39.130
 thick because of the seriousness that I 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:41.470
 I put here but it is an attempt to 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:49.630
 purchase more you can remove this 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:51.340
 same corner now that the video is 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.490
 writes the jewel channel and until the week 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.490
 next
