00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.560
 saved all entities are games 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.370
 Dr. White we are here today for a new one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.590
 video dedicated to fifa last 14 teams is 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.610
 an episode of the best players of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.440
 last team you told me don't do anymore 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 strikers I chose to make a wing 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 right playing in the liga 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.750
 obviously this week came out 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 well its second enhanced version 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.789
 but it costs about 4 million credits 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 so it's a toy for a few 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 because it is a limited credit card 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.830
 probably therefore decided to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 always bring them a right striker 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
 of liga bbva but more affordable 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.370
 all namely carlos sail statistics 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.770
 interesting let's see how it behaves 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 starting as always speed first 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 but I always put this clip on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 with sail where it burns if the comes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.020
 show the season to make you understand 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 how strong this player is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.629
 speed I said is very good 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 excellent acceleration on the 89 and one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 good top speed so you are in 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 able to skip all the defenders 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 opponents 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.979
 suffer slightly with the physical though 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.950
 you saw before he jumped they will rise 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.530
 which in any case has no lower value than 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 physical strength maybe some back like 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 may be the various maicon then i 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170
 very strong full-backs can physically 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.750
 be suffering slightly pro 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 others like walkers like PCs you can 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 skip them and fly towards the door 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 as for the shot it is not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.009
 not bad at all even this indicates a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.860
 finalization value 86 in my opinion is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 slightly higher for some aces 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 problem with the shot because sometimes in the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 one against one with the goalkeeper is wrong 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.930
 so sometimes you will get it wrong 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 as in this case where it was in front 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.820
 to the goalkeeper and the shot is stopped 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
 because goalkeeper that makes one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 very good parade though very often 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 manages to score with great 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.170
 ease both from near and far 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 therefore excellent in all three in the field 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.579
 priest to cause it to leave on 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.009
 center to center to attract from 20 25 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.990
 meters as in this case look at them yes 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 go to center almost reaches the limit 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.150
 area pulls the goalkeeper into the corner 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.670
 he can't do it 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.810
 excellent is the precision shot that of 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 power 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.640
 what leaves a little to be desired e 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.350
 the stars weak foot because why 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.320
 just two pid stables and he had so he is 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.810
 a southpaw like robben, so a left-handed 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.310
 with a very good left but a right 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.690
 which practically never fails to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.310
 use for these weak sentences 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.080
 they are really very few 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 there is something positive that compared to robben is 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.710
 little known so you can go 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 quietly on the left of 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.730
 opponents often let you have it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.050
 seen so many clips where I am with 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.610
 the outside is able to return 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.190
 quietly without that none 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 defender go to fight me for how much 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.880
 it's about phenomenal dribbling is a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 really really agile player from 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.690
 great extra ball control 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.820
 four skinny stars so you can do 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.730
 practically all three really if you 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.140
 like to jump opponents in agility e 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
 with a ball control 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 crazy try this player on 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.580
 passage is not much is more a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.350
 game finalizer that one who goes to 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.500
 create anyway every now and then 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.150
 put his companions in the door 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 it is not the exterior that is suitable for this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.010
 role for example is used in a 4 3 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.500
 3 with jazz rodriguez and rodriguez has me 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.959
 made the coup of more than him 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.810
 head is quite short because 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.570
 because it is only one meter high and 77 therefore 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.670
 it is not suitable for a game based on 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.650
 cross then use it if you like the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.410
 ground ball game anyway at speed 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.330
 look at so many times I go away in 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.400
 speed like nothing to the defenders 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.959
 opponents that you do n't style vi 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.690
 I recommend using with this 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.700
 player definitely dedaj dedaj 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.170
 increases the pass of the pass that 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.570
 we have seen are a little two points 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.310
 weak shot in this way to increase 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.989
 the finalization the passage I go to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.880
 improve all values ​​so 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.459
 have an attacker also able to 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.370
 make play for the team mates or shooting e 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.720
 drills in this case the shot goes from 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.580
 increase again for the speech a 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.989
 florence or dribbling is already high proof 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.690
 to still slightly improve it for 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.400
 let him be sick where to use this 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.150
 there is good player playing in the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.100
 liga bbva and Mexican so many 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.049
 leagues we can tie it to 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.299
 use or a 4 3 3 in this case with 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.420
 crown of santos an attack is true 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.920
 very low fast because he then crowns at 5 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.440
 The styles two other players have a 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.570
 crazy dripping I recommend sailing a 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.850
 alto was the world 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.400
 so use it only or as ad 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.720
 hoc omit you please don't use it 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.180
 how external now because it really is 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.670
 wasted or in a lot of training 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.130
 very offensive like this a 3 4 3 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.200
 of the liga bbva we have coast that goes 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.600
 lowering to take balls can throw 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.370
 belen rodriguez on the exteriors we have of 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.920
 maria is watched by are players 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.300
 that incessantly make the band is 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.820
 in attack we have in defense then 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.950
 casemiro that a pearl of the liga bbva 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.020
 because because it is cheap and is a 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.690
 crazy player for a lot of defense 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.310
 fast with import short as that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.810
 probably one of the best goalkeepers 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.870
 to the world right now 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.610
 conclusion on sailing at a speed 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.590
 very good is very agile is left-handed 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.720
 people don't know and send you on yours 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.120
 strong foot and the price because it costs 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.490
 only a thousand credits on playstation 4 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.410
 these are three and nine hundred on xbox 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.420
 therefore within everyone's reach 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.740
 nationality league are extremely 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.530
 competitive 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.450
 don't trust the liga and saying that 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.950
 it costs a lot to make you a team 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.320
 because it is not true at all 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.490
 they cost so much only various neymar bale 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.020
 ronaldo 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.030
 these people here cost so much but 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.890
 you can make a very liga team 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.200
 competitive even with low players 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.760
 price maybe avoid taking xavi 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.440
 iniesta because they cost too much compared to 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.870
 how much they really are worth in the game 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.390
 of against two stars pil is weak and the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.000
 physical strength then play a little like 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.860
 if he was using a I put them 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.090
 9 times end because really a 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.920
 non-transferable player 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.330
 try it if you have already tried it 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.060
 there is also a version in the comments 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.950
 import as a central point but in my opinion 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.350
 the most suitable for a two-point attack 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.780
 tips if you can use in a bit 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.630
 only much better to take the version 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.680
 to date we have concluded followed away 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.000
