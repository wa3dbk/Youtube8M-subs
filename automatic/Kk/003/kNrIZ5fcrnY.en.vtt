00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

future mobile phones have taken all so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
future mobile phones have taken all so
beautifully<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> generation<00:00:54.390> today<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
beautifully and the generation today is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
beautifully and the generation today is
definitely<00:00:56.129> much<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.340> comfortable<00:00:57.120> with

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
definitely much more comfortable with

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
definitely much more comfortable with
technology<00:00:57.620> as<00:00:58.620> compared<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> people<00:00:59.399> even

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
technology as compared to people even

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.110 
technology as compared to people even
like<00:01:00.120> us<00:01:00.359> having<00:01:00.930> said<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.829> take<00:01:02.789> off<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
like us having said that the take off of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.080 
like us having said that the take off of
this<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.480> depends<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.700> newspapers<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this also depends on newspapers have

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
this also depends on newspapers have
still<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.570> replaced<00:01:06.869> by<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> newspaper<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
still not got replaced by a newspaper so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
still not got replaced by a newspaper so
this<00:01:07.979> take<00:01:08.310> off<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.360> time

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this take off would also take some time

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
this take off would also take some time
and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.159> e-textbooks<00:01:11.760> replacing

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
textbooks let sit for the next two or

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
textbooks let sit for the next two or
three<00:01:14.100> years<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.700> sure<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:16.200> see

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
three years for sure but I do see

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.320 
three years for sure but I do see
students<00:01:16.799> reading<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.250> kindle<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.729> iPads<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
students reading on kindle or iPads a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
students reading on kindle or iPads a
lot<00:01:18.479> more<00:01:18.720> today<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
lot more today right but you see that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
lot more today right but you see that
agree<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> happen<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
agree it's not going to happen in the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
agree it's not going to happen in the
near<00:01:22.409> future<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.610> interesting

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
near future but it's an interesting

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.420 
near future but it's an interesting
discussion<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:24.990> children<00:01:25.470> adapt<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
discussion because children adapt to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
discussion because children adapt to
technology<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.570> today<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> might

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
technology so well today so it might

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
technology so well today so it might
just<00:01:28.530> change<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.310> dynamics<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> classroom

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just change the dynamics of a classroom

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.870 
just change the dynamics of a classroom
would<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> agree<00:01:30.869> yes<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> would

would you agree yes I think it would

reading other articles on the ebooks and
you<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> doing<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you know like the kind of doing the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
you know like the kind of doing the
self-help<00:01:48.899> books<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> ebooks<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
self-help books on the ebooks but

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
self-help books on the ebooks but
definitely<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> textbooks<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> would

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
definitely as the textbooks it would

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
definitely as the textbooks it would
pick<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.890> soon<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:53.820> be

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
pick up very soon I think it could be

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.929 
pick up very soon I think it could be
like<00:01:54.810> before<00:01:54.990> 23<00:01:55.680> years<00:01:55.920> i'm<00:01:56.130> 23<00:01:56.490> years<00:01:56.670> i

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
like before 23 years i'm 23 years i

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
like before 23 years i'm 23 years i
would<00:01:57.090> put<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> maximum<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.829> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
would put it as a maximum because it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.030 
would put it as a maximum because it
will<00:01:59.549> save<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> cost<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.259> will<00:02:01.439> help<00:02:01.619> also

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
will save that cost it will help also

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.429 
will save that cost it will help also
the<00:02:02.130> teachers<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> customize<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.930> lectures

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the teachers to customize the lectures

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.740 
the teachers to customize the lectures
as<00:02:04.710> per<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> required<00:02:05.969> by<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> students

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
as per what is required by the students

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930 
as per what is required by the students
because<00:02:06.840> right<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.500> textbooks<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.190> lot

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
because right now the textbooks have lot

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.320 
because right now the textbooks have lot
of<00:02:08.970> obsolete<00:02:09.720> things<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.340> present<00:02:11.849> textbooks

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
of obsolete things the present textbooks

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.110 
of obsolete things the present textbooks
as<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> paper

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
as in the paper

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
as in the paper
but<00:02:13.629> ebooks<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.349> customized<00:02:14.980> number<00:02:15.489> one

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
but ebooks can be customized number one

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.869 
but ebooks can be customized number one
they<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.209> updated<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:18.549> would

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
they can be updated and it would

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.059 
they can be updated and it would
definitely<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.569> more<00:02:19.810> portable<00:02:20.200> more<00:02:20.709> easier

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
definitely be more portable more easier

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.399 
definitely be more portable more easier
to<00:02:21.250> carry<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.120> these<00:02:22.420> favors<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.840> lot<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.170> paper

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
to carry so these favors a lot of paper

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.830 
to carry so these favors a lot of paper
but<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.190> look<00:02:24.459> at<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
but then if you look at the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.910 
but then if you look at the
contradictory<00:02:25.840> point<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.799> know

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
contradictory point to it you know

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.979 
contradictory point to it you know
technology<00:02:27.730> works<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.180> fast<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.659> teachers

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
technology works so fast the teachers

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.930 
technology works so fast the teachers
not<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.829> Swift<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:30.670> then<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
not going to be so Swift but then you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.699 
not going to be so Swift but then you
know<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.569> almost<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.560> replace

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
know they almost are going to replace

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.740 
know they almost are going to replace
teachers<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.730> certain<00:02:33.909> sense<00:02:34.269> but<00:02:34.659> you're

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
teachers in a certain sense but you're

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.270

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
better or learn better so it's really

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
you are doing a test if you're doing a

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.370 
you are doing a test if you're doing a
test<00:03:15.849> online<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.569> you're<00:03:16.989> getting<00:03:17.260> your

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
test online then you're getting your

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.659 
test online then you're getting your
answers<00:03:17.739> right<00:03:17.769> there<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> teacher

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
answers right there but the teacher

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.330 
answers right there but the teacher
probably<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.209> able<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.569> point<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.900> those<00:03:20.340> areas

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
probably is able to point to those areas

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.250 
probably is able to point to those areas
where<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:22.060> haven't<00:03:22.269> fared<00:03:22.569> well<00:03:22.810> which

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
where you haven't fared well which

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.220 
where you haven't fared well which
probably<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.950> computer<00:03:24.609> water<00:03:24.819> well<00:03:25.569> yes<00:03:25.959> and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
probably a computer water well yes and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.500 
probably a computer water well yes and
no<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> teachers<00:03:27.609> would<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.940> still

number of students who want to take
tests<00:03:41.049> by<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.829> way<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.250> e-books<00:03:42.699> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
tests by the way of e-books the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.449 
tests by the way of e-books the
interactive<00:03:43.690> tests<00:03:44.019> have<00:03:44.260> risen<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:45.280> by<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
interactive tests have risen just by the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
interactive tests have risen just by the
introduction<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.239> e-books<00:03:46.599> in<00:03:46.780> some<00:03:46.989> schools

introduction of e-books in some schools

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.550 
introduction of e-books in some schools
yeah<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> interactive<00:03:49.840> assessment

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
yeah and so the interactive assessment

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.559 
yeah and so the interactive assessment
and<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.829> tests<00:03:51.220> has<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:52.000> important

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
and the tests has a are more important

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.330 
and the tests has a are more important
but<00:03:52.720> she<00:03:52.959> has<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.109> catch<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.590> up<00:03:53.739> as<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.889> textbook

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
but she has to catch it up as a textbook

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.729 
but she has to catch it up as a textbook
proper<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.970> will<00:03:55.090> take<00:03:55.239> 2-3<00:03:55.389> years<00:03:55.810> but

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
proper it will take 2-3 years but

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.979 
proper it will take 2-3 years but
students<00:03:57.190> are<00:03:57.280> inter<00:03:57.639> giving<00:03:58.389> far<00:03:58.690> better

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
students are inter giving far better

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.500 
students are inter giving far better
analytical<00:03:59.769> skills<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.400> all<00:04:00.519> on<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.970> test

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
analytical skills and all on the test

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.289 
analytical skills and all on the test
part<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.859> tests<00:04:03.220> trade<00:04:03.400> shows<00:04:03.609> at<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
part of it so tests trade shows at the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.089 
part of it so tests trade shows at the
scores<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.930> tests<00:04:05.260> are<00:04:05.319> improving<00:04:05.739> more

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
scores and the tests are improving more

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.339 
scores and the tests are improving more
by<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.430> use<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:06.910> ebooks<00:04:07.239> by<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:08.169> use<00:04:08.319> of

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
by the use of the ebooks by the use of

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.420 
by the use of the ebooks by the use of
ESPN<00:04:08.980> but<00:04:09.160> then<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.459> we<00:04:09.639> if<00:04:09.879> we<00:04:09.910> really<00:04:10.329> look<00:04:10.449> at

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
ESPN but then if we if we really look at

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.280 
ESPN but then if we if we really look at
in<00:04:12.430> terms<00:04:12.699> of<00:04:12.910> performance<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.959> look<00:04:14.139> at<00:04:14.260> a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
in terms of performance and we look at a

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.259 
in terms of performance and we look at a
lot<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.620> these<00:04:14.829> big<00:04:15.459> schools

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
lot of these big schools

teacher explaining it to you on a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.629 
teacher explaining it to you on a
blackboard<00:04:44.199> is<00:04:44.379> extremely<00:04:45.129> different<00:04:45.280> and

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
blackboard is extremely different and

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.390 
blackboard is extremely different and
much<00:04:46.030> better<00:04:46.349> so<00:04:47.349> that's<00:04:47.740> probably<00:04:48.129> where

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
much better so that's probably where

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.189 
much better so that's probably where
this<00:04:48.520> would<00:04:48.699> really<00:04:48.970> work<00:04:49.120> right<00:04:49.720> now<00:04:49.870> we<00:04:50.080> just

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
this would really work right now we just

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.710 
this would really work right now we just
have<00:04:50.319> some<00:04:50.530> new<00:04:50.770> sir<00:04:51.039> coming<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.520> off<00:04:51.759> Salman
