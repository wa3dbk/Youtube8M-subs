technology<00:00:59.680> is<00:01:00.159> just<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.430> number<00:01:00.699> of

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
technology is just the number of

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.689 
technology is just the number of
polygons<00:01:01.720> that<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.470> are<00:01:02.619> able<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.979> push<00:01:03.250> just

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
polygons that we are able to push just

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.460 
polygons that we are able to push just
to<00:01:03.879> give<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.150> an<00:01:04.299> example<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:05.019> spider-man

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
to give you an example a spider-man

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.810 
to give you an example a spider-man
model<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.220> spider-man<00:01:06.850> 2<00:01:07.090> was<00:01:08.100> 4,500<00:01:09.100> 5,000

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
model and spider-man 2 was 4,500 5,000

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.390 
model and spider-man 2 was 4,500 5,000
polygons<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.540> for<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> next<00:01:11.830> generation

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
polygons and for the next generation

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.440 
polygons and for the next generation
we're<00:01:12.760> running<00:01:13.560> 55,000<00:01:14.560> polygons<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:16.210> course

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
we're running 55,000 polygons of course

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.639 
we're running 55,000 polygons of course
he's<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.719> main<00:01:16.899> character<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.350> he's<00:01:17.500> very

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
he's the main character so he's very

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.929 
he's the main character so he's very
important<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.130> we're<00:01:18.310> willing<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.729> spend

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
important and we're willing to spend

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.670 
important and we're willing to spend
that<00:01:19.299> sort<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.630> polygons<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.289> him<00:01:20.409> but<00:01:20.530> it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
that sort of polygons on him but it's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.410 
that sort of polygons on him but it's
you<00:01:20.859> know<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.310> very<00:01:21.430> fact<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.030> we<00:01:22.240> can

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
you know just the very fact that we can

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.910 
you know just the very fact that we can
draw<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.899> kind<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.289> character<00:01:23.560> because

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
draw this kind of a character because

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.139 
draw this kind of a character because
I'm<00:01:24.039> like<00:01:24.219> anything<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:24.789> we've<00:01:24.909> been<00:01:25.000> able

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
I'm like anything that we've been able

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.929 
I'm like anything that we've been able
to<00:01:25.299> do<00:01:25.479> before<00:01:25.859> I'm<00:01:26.859> trying<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.250> make<00:01:27.429> the<00:01:27.640> two

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
to do before I'm trying to make the two

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.060 
to do before I'm trying to make the two
characters<00:01:28.659> red<00:01:28.929> suit<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.350> black<00:01:29.530> suit<00:01:29.829> feel

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
characters red suit and black suit feel

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.039 
characters red suit and black suit feel
really<00:01:30.310> different<00:01:30.700> we<00:01:31.149> really<00:01:31.359> took<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.780> core

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
really different we really took the core

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.719 
really different we really took the core
of<00:01:32.079> red<00:01:32.380> suit<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.859> we<00:01:32.920> said<00:01:33.100> well<00:01:33.219> what<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:33.609> we

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
of red suit and we said well what can we

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.819 
of red suit and we said well what can we
do<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:33.939> make<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.899> character<00:01:35.320> more<00:01:35.500> impactful

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
do to make this character more impactful

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.349 
do to make this character more impactful
because<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.310> fact<00:01:36.549> it's<00:01:36.789> not<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.969> different

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
because in fact it's not a different

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.819 
because in fact it's not a different
character<00:01:37.750> it's<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:37.990> same<00:01:38.170> character<00:01:38.619> but

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
character it's the same character but

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.010 
character it's the same character but
more<00:01:39.520> powerful<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.149> stronger<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.840> faster

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
more powerful and stronger and faster

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.569 
more powerful and stronger and faster
and<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.619> think<00:01:41.829> that's<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.070> really<00:01:42.340> cool<00:01:42.549> moment

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
and I think that's a really cool moment

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.940 
and I think that's a really cool moment
