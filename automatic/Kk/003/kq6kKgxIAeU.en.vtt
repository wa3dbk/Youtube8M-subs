 the oldest facilities of the current school of command techniques 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.920
 control and telecommunications old school transmissions come from the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.930
 military academy of aeronautical engineers and in turn they were built 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.089
 to initially house the aerotechnical upper school in 1928 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.380
 the year after its creation he was appointed director of the higher school 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.359
 of art kenya the lieutenant colonel of the aviation scale don emilio herrera 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.190
 linares 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.220
 who had personally made the plans of the building that later 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.670
 would house the aforementioned school 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.090
 the upper art school began to operate in February 1930 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 to train aeronautical engineers for the first time in Spain 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.570
 the superior council of arona botica determined that said school should 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.660
 also cover the needs of naval and civil aeronautics much more 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.870
 developed that the minute 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.520
 from 1934, courses for aviation controls were carried out 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.850
 highlighting as teachers barberán and herrera 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.230
 in December of 1939 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.450
 The Military Academy of Aeronautical Engineers is created. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 the facilities of the old high school of arts girl 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.430
 in February of 1946 by order of the minister don eduardo gonzález-gallarza 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.830
 the air army broadcast school is created for the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.140
 theoretical and practical improvement of the staff 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 that provides its services in transmissions 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.870
 after various vicissitudes on May 29, 1951 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.160
 by order of the staff of the air the school of transmissions tom 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.159
 settlement in the place where it currently resides 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 in March of 1953 the school consolidates its training activities 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.840
 The first full course of specialists began at their facilities 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.540
 in 1958 with the installation of a simulator of operations of the system of 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.900
 air defense 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.660
 initiates its activities as school of interception controllers 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 On September 5, 1996, the school of transmissions was renamed 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.179
 School of control and telecommunications control techniques 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.989
 a month later 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.479
 said school are integrated four-wind air base 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.699
 as an independent unit 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.919
 now under these old buildings we can find a school 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.409
 modern dynamics and permanently updated 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.659
 in which multiple and varied teachings of load are taught 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.010
 with the support of new technologies
