00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 dotcom and creator of the piece system is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.130
 weight loss that more than 40 wins and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.550
 I'm here today to pass on to you. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.400
 a tip of a simple meal 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 fast and effective is this meal that I 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.320
 I usually call Juice GrÃªmio will stay 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.200
 for you because my name is coogan and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 I'll still explain to you why 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.410
 You can continue to burn the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 fat after a meal like this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 even while lying down or sitting on the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 sofa is then the next first because 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 It's gummy juice that had a drawing 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 animated teddy bears there and such that they 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 have a drink of gany juice 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.899
 only that what they used to suck was with 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 letter u was juice guinea 2 in ny and are 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 there but this when it had to have 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 courage and when it was going to get stronger 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 to adorn the evildoers, eh ? 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 I was in the house at the moment lethal flame 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.700
 that even an enthusiastic guy from the area and such 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 and trains also do workouts burning 48 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 hours everything else and he was in the house 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.810
 his and passed on top and sukiyaki top 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.549
 neckel in the right way here 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 Then I found the idea very interesting. 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.900
 it 's fast and simple to dedicate 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 adapt that we'll show the galley 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.189
 This money will work for you. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.259
 So I paid it, win it because 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.970
 It's for 61 years it's time to leave 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.630
 you stronger healthier and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.590
 potentiate fat reduction and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.720
 because on the couch 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 this meal to show you 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 here and there 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.259
 it has a high protein content and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.920
 protein it performs some functions 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.930
 of our body that is 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.840
 favor fat reduction and two 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 of them is society because the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.009
 society and with more protein 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 releases some hormones that give 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.360
 satiety, however, everything can perceive 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.729
 if you eat a meal that does not contain 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 protein in an hour and a half later 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.610
 are you hungry 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 now after how they grill 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.989
 and Sunday will see that there will be four 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 five hours without eating you will not be hungry 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.170
 then this strong effect of 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.060
 protein that society 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.400
 the second one of the best is the effect 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 thermogenic that means that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.470
 The more protein you do not ingest 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.680
 within the daily capacity to be 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 human plus spend time with you guys will have 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.640
 without having to do practically nothing 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.500
 so just so you have an idea what 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.930
 thermogenic effect of 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.860
 around 30% and mean it's it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.630
 no calories from protein 30 calories will go 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.670
 be diverted only for absorption and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.670
 metabolize these proteins then by 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.769
 This is what the protein is like with a 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 function has a worldwide 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.610
 fat weight loss to leave the island 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.110
 plate too and is one of the people 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.030
 on this side in that scope then 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.489
 I want to pass on to you so I lost 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 to lose an idea the option of doing the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.110
 breakfast or afternoon snack or 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.239
 Even supper before bed has 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.310
 this is going to be done every 40 seconds 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.450
 I think you're done and you can do it. 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 everything right 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.160
 So I'll show you what you need. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.560
 to make the southern one win to leave 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.530
 the strong healthy and fat people in the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.040
 gutted belly is the next then me 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 xbox got here right that is clear of one 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.989
 It does not look like a small business that 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.010
 but it is only egg white and in 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.840
 pasteurized is not at risk of catching 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.100
 this modern or nothing 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.350
 two bananas here are not fruity and one of the 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.739
 many problems that I say is a 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.239
 protein is so so let's get one 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.989
 attack inside you see how it is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:53.190
 so usually the 250ml boot declares 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.930
 without water or anything just clear you should 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.650
 wondering base is a mess 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.500
 wacc today we do not smell 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.620
 tastes will be alone with the taste and i 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.200
 I like banana nothing later is something 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.019
 sensational and you're going to take it with 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.280
 pleasure is then two bananas will cut 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:17.720
 that bananas are practically one per 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.970
 month here in the nearby banana 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 using two or later than 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.780
 further enhance the reduction of 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.130
 fat or even advises to put only for 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.220
 cause of fructose 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.170
 I already have a little more advanced already 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.060
 Boot two here even because today 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:49.100
 I just trained and I'll put two in here. 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:59.690
 the banana chocolate law to give 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:05:02.960
 It's a good idea, we 're 25 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.390
 30 grams of protein is a meal that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.460
 more provide you with some anxiety 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.410
 I believe people asked me what 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.270
 I can make breakfast 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.240
 The idea is this is a great idea of 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.160
 Breakfast is by far the making 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.500
 late and that I did not even speak before 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:28.640
 I know now I'm going to go back here 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:31.180
 blender that is there and I will 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.180
 hit here 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:57.790
 then the ready we will see how is the 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:03.610
 our program and now look, just stay 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.610
 creamy looks like melted ice cream see 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.660
 Nothing like listening to anything. 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.760
 do 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.090
 makes sure you play probably 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.060
 they will find on the market a shot of 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.130
 box here but if there are several brands 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.780
 made boring even you can do with the eggs 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.850
 - it will only take a little longer for a 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.870
 born eggbreaker can do with the 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.870
 bones, no problem 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.900
 a tip is easier to beat a habit 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.450
 today than tomorrow because it's because 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.850
 Usually tomorrow never comes and the 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.710
 procrastination in people's lives 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.630
 and that is why most do not reach 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.940
 the results are so I have a 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.980
 very strong duty here in Brazil try 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.660

 a brazil without a stomach, right? 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.010
 if you reduce your stomachs from Brazil to 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.110
 people will have less disease 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.690
 not only aesthetic but also 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.550
