STUDIO HEAD 20W - tube amplifier

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.980
Hello, I'm Zbyszek Krebs,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.060
we are in Izabelin C (Sonus) studio.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.100
I invite you to watch presentation of Bash Studio Head 20 amplifier.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.860
So, we have two channels.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.460
Clean channel,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.700
and... unclean channel.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.740
Each of them has it's own equalisation,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.720
and each is same fantastic.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.260
And actually that's all I could say about it,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.060
because you just have to listen to it.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.140
You got to listen, play and then life becomes easier

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.140
when you have Bash Studio Head 20 amp.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920
Thanks for your attention.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.840
So let's demonstrate some hit on clean channel.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.340
This was... unclean channel.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.040
As you have noticed there was much of dark force in it.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.460
So, this channel is just as we have heard.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.780
It's quite flexible,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.080
we can make the guitar to sound very nice,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.880
very clean.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.900
And with one move we can get feeling,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.080
of death from behind.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.900
That's it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.680
