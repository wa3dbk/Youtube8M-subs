00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.050
 i 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.130
 yes 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.940
 hello very good trout I'm expecting 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.680
 16 and welcome to this new video in 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.560
 which I want to show you how we are going to 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.020
 delete temporary files files 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.000
 our team's garbage accord these 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.430
 good files 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.920
 can cause our team to go 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.480
 quite slow and can even 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.610
 occupy enough size of what it is 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.170
 our hard drive then yes yes that 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.970
 It is highly recommended from time to time 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.040
 delete those temporary files that 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.940
 The only thing they do is occupy space and 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.370
 good to slow down our pc worth saying 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.950
 this is going to start with the tutorial what 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 let's do without any program like that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.300
 that we are not going to need to download 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.890
 absolutely nothing and the first thing that 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.170
 we're going to have to do is go here to 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 start and let's write here execute 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.530
 agree to execute voucher will appear 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.990
 this sentence here an incognito that 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.320
 it puts run let's give it there we do 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.330
 click and good 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 here I already have the two sentences that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.650
 we must write in the first 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.479
 this sentence we are going to do we are going to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.390
 delete temporary files of three 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.190
 forms so to speak the first thing that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 let's erase are going to be the issues worth 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.410
 then we are going to write this sentence 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.750
 as you can see there in the blue box 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.650
 It is worth to you to write that as is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 is 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.350
 We accept accept and open the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 folders are not all 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.189
 temporary 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.150
 all these temporary ones we can 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.020
 erase are 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.000
 of pages that we have entered are 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.380
 the process of things that we have 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.259
 downloaded that they have stayed there and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.599
 other icons that are lost 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 and co-development the door then everything 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.239
 we can erase this we are going to do 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 select everything to see that I'm wrong 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.250
 air up everything is worth once 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.060
 selected for nothing we give in 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 remove 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.210
 well here does not erase me the storms of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.200
 some programs that I'm using 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.760
 now how can they be the field that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.130
 is the one of qantas already in agreement then 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.900
 Well, do not erase it, but it's good 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.090
 the moment that I leave it erases it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.250
 are the temporary ones that are staying 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.800
 there so that we for the team 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.260
 because when opening a program what 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.830
 that is opens faster and does not have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.200
 to be waiting a little more 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.870
 time but good after all we 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 it takes space 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.440
 value let's do the other sentence 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.080
 we go back to running and we're going to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.590
 select new you wrote that you read 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.069
 here presets is worth what it is there 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.340
 you wrote it we will give in accept and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.340
 good here opens us what is this this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.069
 well worth another window this other 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.420
 folder in which they are also saved 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.700
 quite temporary but these 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.890
 they are usually good they are usually they are almost 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 all of programs that keep there are 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.370
 small files are small 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.849
 temporary to go faster at the time 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.860
 of loading some waters of agreement but 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.370
 well as I say it is not appreciated in 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.050
 absolute and I think we should delete it 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.700
 not frequently but if from time to time 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.630
 when we agree then we're going to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.630
 select them all 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.250
 below and we go to the right button delete 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.310
 dizzy we have eliminated this is the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.980
 second way and we're going to do 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.980
 temporary embroidery in another way than 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.930
 they are rather the temporary ones that leave 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.760
 that we leave when we sail 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.159
 then we are going to go here to start 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.170
 control panel as you see opens us here 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.480
 our windows 7 control panel and 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.729
 we will give you in internet options 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.280
 here we have internet options 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.160
 click here and this will open 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.490
 I agree with that little window which 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.250
 we are going to choose here comes 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.919
 exploration history is worth we have 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.220
 have to apply to the general tab 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.139
 and we look at each other here in the section 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.600
 exploration history we're going to 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.550
 delete and this other one will appear 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.800
 window then we are going to 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.800
 explain what we need to eliminate 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.600
 as you see password, it is not 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.220
 convenient to eliminate it I think if it's 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.190
 convenient to eliminate are data from 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.300
 forms and download history 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.639
 passwords and this last data from 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.280
 filtering and tracking protection is or not 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.610
 agreement 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.370
 so we do not mark the popcorn 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.590
 we have here as you see on the screen and 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.730
 we are going to give it to eliminate it 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:15.090
 is waiting for good this may take 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.550
 a time depending on the time that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.090
 you have been without removing things from 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.560
 browsing history and nothing in me 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.560
 house has been quite procuro let's 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.810
 accept and usually give him 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.910
 It usually remains in a lot of temporary 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.760
 good 7 because usually everything is in the 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.520
 Recycle bin agreement this would be 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.900
 the last step to totally eliminate 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.790
 well all these files so of 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.260
 nothing we go here to the bin and you 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.520
 we give to empty the recycling bin 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.669
 I speak to you here and empty we will give in 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.580
 Okay we have it already and I will not have anything 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.280
 lifted off 500 megs for 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.020
 well the truth is that it is quite size and 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.720
 good at last to the end because it is only 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.240
 they are temporary, the only thing 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.419
 do is occupy space and slow down the 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.009
 team and nothing with this already finished what 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.620
