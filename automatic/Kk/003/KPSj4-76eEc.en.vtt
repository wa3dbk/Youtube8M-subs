00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.030 

okay<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.560> just<00:00:01.589> want<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> talk

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
okay in this video I just want to talk

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.649 
okay in this video I just want to talk
about<00:00:02.159> multiplying<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.030> dividing<00:00:03.060> complex

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
about multiplying and dividing complex

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.289 
about multiplying and dividing complex
numbers<00:00:04.490> and<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> main<00:00:05.759> thing<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.120> need<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
numbers and the main thing you need to

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.940 
numbers and the main thing you need to
remember<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.870> complex<00:00:07.319> numbers<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.919> just

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
remember the complex numbers is just

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.400 
remember the complex numbers is just
that<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.670> squared<00:00:09.150> equals<00:00:09.450> negative<00:00:09.809> 1

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
that I squared equals negative 1

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.190 
that I squared equals negative 1
whenever<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.040> encounter<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.200> suppose

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
whenever you encounter that so suppose

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.730 
whenever you encounter that so suppose
we<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.410> 4<00:00:13.950> plus<00:00:14.309> 3i<00:00:16.640> times<00:00:17.640> 2<00:00:17.990> -<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:19.650> know

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we have 4 plus 3i times 2 - I don't know

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.029 
we have 4 plus 3i times 2 - I don't know
let's<00:00:19.980> say<00:00:20.270> 5<00:00:21.270> i<00:00:21.470> if<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> multiply

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
let's say 5 i if we want to multiply

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.269 
let's say 5 i if we want to multiply
this<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.720> foil<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.980> 4

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this out all you do is just foil it so 4

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.019 
this out all you do is just foil it so 4
times<00:00:26.550> 2<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:27.599> give<00:00:27.720> us<00:00:27.869> positive<00:00:28.109> 8<00:00:28.820> 4<00:00:29.820> times

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
times 2 will give us positive 8 4 times

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.479 
times 2 will give us positive 8 4 times
negative<00:00:30.330> 5i<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.730> -20<00:00:32.730> i<00:00:33.620> positive<00:00:34.620> 3i<00:00:35.010> times

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
negative 5i is -20 i positive 3i times

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.110 
negative 5i is -20 i positive 3i times
2i<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.600> positive<00:00:36.840> 6<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.120> then

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
2i is going to be positive 6 i and then

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.819 
2i is going to be positive 6 i and then
on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> outside<00:00:39.719> we'll<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.200> minus<00:00:40.910> 15<00:00:41.910> i

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
on the outside we'll get minus 15 i

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.580 
on the outside we'll get minus 15 i
squared<00:00:44.120> okay<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.180> let's<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> 8<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
squared okay so let's see this is 8 I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
squared okay so let's see this is 8 I
could<00:00:46.920> combine<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.520> negative<00:00:47.730> 20<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
could combine the negative 20 I and the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.590 
could combine the negative 20 I and the
positive<00:00:49.289> 16<00:00:49.829> ah<00:00:50.010> excuse<00:00:50.550> me<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> positive<00:00:50.910> 6i

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
positive 16 ah excuse me the positive 6i

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.490 
positive 16 ah excuse me the positive 6i
and<00:00:51.930> make<00:00:52.079> minus<00:00:52.500> 14<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.660> but<00:00:54.660> remember<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and make minus 14 I but remember here I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
and make minus 14 I but remember here I
squared<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> same<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.000> negative<00:00:57.360> 1

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
squared is the same thing as negative 1

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
squared is the same thing as negative 1
so<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.800> replace<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> squared

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so I'm going to replace the I squared

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
so I'm going to replace the I squared
there<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> negative<00:01:00.809> 1<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.609> we

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there with the negative 1 so really we

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.390 
there with the negative 1 so really we
have<00:01:02.760> 8<00:01:03.210> minus<00:01:04.140> 14<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.180> plus<00:01:06.180> 15<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.650> 8<00:01:07.860> plus<00:01:08.189> 15

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
have 8 minus 14 I plus 15 so 8 plus 15

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
have 8 minus 14 I plus 15 so 8 plus 15
will<00:01:08.820> give<00:01:08.970> us<00:01:09.090> 23<00:01:09.920> minus<00:01:10.920> 14<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:13.350> will

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
will give us 23 minus 14 I and that will

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
will give us 23 minus 14 I and that will
be<00:01:13.680> our<00:01:13.799> solution<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.580> case<00:01:17.210> suppose<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
be our solution in this case suppose it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.520 
be our solution in this case suppose it
was<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.680> number<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.509> 2<00:01:21.869> minus<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
was the number I don't know 2 minus I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.359 
was the number I don't know 2 minus I
and<00:01:23.659> then<00:01:24.659> maybe<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.229> 4<00:01:26.509> plus<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.159> well<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and then maybe it was 4 plus I well in

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.539 
and then maybe it was 4 plus I well in
this<00:01:29.670> case<00:01:30.079> again<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.650> foil<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.340> out

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this case again we just foil things out

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.469 
this case again we just foil things out
2<00:01:32.880> +<00:01:33.060> 4<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.299> 8<00:01:33.740> 2<00:01:34.740> times<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.220> will<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.579> positive<00:01:36.210> 2

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
2 + 4 is 8 2 times I will be positive 2

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.420 
2 + 4 is 8 2 times I will be positive 2
I<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.799> inside<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.640> negative<00:01:38.939> 4i<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
I on the inside will get negative 4i and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.569 
I on the inside will get negative 4i and
then<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> outside<00:01:42.180> we'll<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.689> negative<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
then on the outside we'll get negative I

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.889 
then on the outside we'll get negative I
squared<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> again<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.040> give<00:01:47.189> us<00:01:47.340> 8

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
squared so again this will give us 8

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.450 
squared so again this will give us 8
positive<00:01:48.899> 2<00:01:49.079> minus<00:01:49.560> 4<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.250> negative<00:01:50.820> 2i<00:01:51.540> i

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
positive 2 minus 4 is negative 2i i

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
positive 2 minus 4 is negative 2i i
squared<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.970> negative<00:01:54.270> 1<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.770> really

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
squared again is negative 1 so really

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249 
squared again is negative 1 so really
I'm<00:01:56.159> subtracting<00:01:56.430> away<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> negative<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I'm subtracting away a negative which is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.450 
I'm subtracting away a negative which is
a<00:01:58.409> positive<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.939> 8<00:02:00.149> plus<00:02:01.140> 1

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
a positive so really I get 8 plus 1

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.850 
a positive so really I get 8 plus 1
which<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.490> 9<00:02:02.790> minus<00:02:03.390> 2

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
which is 9 minus 2

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.770 
which is 9 minus 2
I<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:05.090> will<00:02:05.300> be<00:02:05.420> my<00:02:05.570> solution<00:02:09.520> okay

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
I and that will be my solution okay

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.580 
I and that will be my solution okay
so<00:02:11.780> maybe<00:02:11.900> let's<00:02:12.110> do<00:02:12.320> one<00:02:12.560> more

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
so maybe let's do one more

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.000 
so maybe let's do one more
multiplication<00:02:13.520> example<00:02:14.650> suppose<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.860> was

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
multiplication example suppose it was

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.480 
multiplication example suppose it was
six<00:02:16.340> minus<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.870> then<00:02:18.290> inside<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.950> brackets

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
six minus I and then inside the brackets

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.580 
six minus I and then inside the brackets
we<00:02:19.700> had<00:02:20.020> four<00:02:21.020> plus<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:22.450> minus<00:02:23.800> three<00:02:24.800> minus<00:02:24.980> i

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
we had four plus I minus three minus i

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
we had four plus I minus three minus i
well<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.040> first<00:02:28.250> case<00:02:28.460> here<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:28.910> would

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
well in the first case here we would

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.880 
well in the first case here we would
want<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.270> simplify<00:02:29.660> things<00:02:29.870> down<00:02:30.380> inside<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
want to simplify things down inside the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.570 
want to simplify things down inside the
brackets<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:33.140> would<00:02:33.590> leave<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.950> six<00:02:34.220> minus

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
brackets so I would leave the six minus

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.900 
brackets so I would leave the six minus
i<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:35.090> front<00:02:35.480> alone<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:37.070> we<00:02:37.250> would<00:02:37.400> have<00:02:37.520> 4

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
i out front alone so we would have 4

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.100 
i out front alone so we would have 4
plus<00:02:38.300> 3i<00:02:39.130> minus<00:02:40.130> 3<00:02:40.989> plus<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.470> when<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> distribute

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
plus 3i minus 3 plus I when I distribute

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.880 
plus 3i minus 3 plus I when I distribute
so<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.290> 6<00:02:45.800> minus<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:47.200> inside<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.380> brackets

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
so that's 6 minus I inside the brackets

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
so that's 6 minus I inside the brackets
we'll<00:02:49.070> get<00:02:49.220> 4<00:02:49.550> minus<00:02:49.730> 3<00:02:50.330> which<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.660> 1<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.830> then

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
we'll get 4 minus 3 which is 1 and then

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.699 
we'll get 4 minus 3 which is 1 and then
we<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.220> positive<00:02:52.850> 3<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.180> plus<00:02:53.300> 1<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.050> which<00:02:54.560> is

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
we have positive 3 I plus 1 I which is

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.510 
we have positive 3 I plus 1 I which is
plus<00:02:55.010> 4i<00:02:56.440> okay<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.680> now<00:02:57.830> we'll<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.070> foil

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
plus 4i okay and now we'll just foil

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.410 
plus 4i okay and now we'll just foil
this<00:02:58.730> out<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.090> before<00:02:59.570> 6<00:03:00.050> times<00:03:00.290> 1<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.590> 6<00:03:01.420> 6

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
this out like before 6 times 1 is 6 6

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.460 
this out like before 6 times 1 is 6 6
times<00:03:02.660> positive<00:03:02.959> 4<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:04.220> positive<00:03:04.790> 24<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.470> on

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
times positive 4 I is positive 24 I on

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.400 
times positive 4 I is positive 24 I on
the<00:03:06.709> inside<00:03:07.070> will<00:03:07.400> get<00:03:07.489> minus<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.510> then<00:03:09.320> on

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the inside will get minus I and then on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.949 
the inside will get minus I and then on
the<00:03:09.530> outside<00:03:09.709> will<00:03:10.160> get<00:03:10.310> minus<00:03:10.730> 4<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.480> squared

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
the outside will get minus 4 I squared

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.880 
the outside will get minus 4 I squared
so<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:15.320> 6<00:03:15.650> 24<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.519> minus<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:17.630> positive<00:03:17.890> 23

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
so this is 6 24 I minus I is positive 23

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.150 
so this is 6 24 I minus I is positive 23
I<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.750> squared<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.900> negative<00:03:20.930> 1<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.920> last

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
I I squared is negative 1 so the last

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.130 
I I squared is negative 1 so the last
term<00:03:22.430> will<00:03:22.610> turn<00:03:22.790> into<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.030> positive<00:03:23.600> 4<00:03:23.870> so

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
term will turn into a positive 4 so

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.300 
term will turn into a positive 4 so
we'll<00:03:25.070> be<00:03:25.190> left<00:03:25.400> with<00:03:25.519> 10<00:03:25.910> plus<00:03:26.660> 23<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> when<00:03:28.160> we

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
we'll be left with 10 plus 23 I when we

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.530 
we'll be left with 10 plus 23 I when we
combine<00:03:28.640> our<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.970> terms

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.599 

all<00:03:32.540> right<00:03:32.689> so<00:03:32.840> let<00:03:32.989> me<00:03:33.079> talk<00:03:33.230> about<00:03:33.609> dividing

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
all right so let me talk about dividing

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.009 
all right so let me talk about dividing
complex<00:03:34.790> numbers<00:03:36.909> so<00:03:37.909> when<00:03:38.569> we<00:03:38.719> divide

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
complex numbers so when we divide

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:48.759 
complex numbers so when we divide
complex<00:03:39.319> numbers<00:03:40.090> 5<00:03:41.090> plus<00:03:41.959> 2i<00:03:44.290> over<00:03:46.689> 4<00:03:47.689> minus<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
complex numbers 5 plus 2i over 4 minus I

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.369 
complex numbers 5 plus 2i over 4 minus I
I<00:03:49.189> should<00:03:50.090> mention<00:03:50.329> real<00:03:50.689> quick<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:51.079> we<00:03:51.200> just

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
I should mention real quick if we just

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.289 
I should mention real quick if we just
have<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> complex<00:03:52.010> number<00:03:52.159> divided<00:03:52.849> by<00:03:52.879> a<00:03:53.000> real

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
have a complex number divided by a real

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
have a complex number divided by a real
number<00:03:53.510> suppose<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.260> was<00:03:54.379> 8<00:03:54.650> plus<00:03:55.329> 4<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.829> divided

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
number suppose it was 8 plus 4 I divided

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:58.300 
number suppose it was 8 plus 4 I divided
by<00:03:58.069> 2

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
by 2

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.129 
by 2
you<00:03:58.669> can<00:03:58.819> basically<00:03:58.939> bust<00:03:59.510> this<00:03:59.689> up<00:03:59.900> like<00:04:00.079> a

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
you can basically bust this up like a

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.209 
you can basically bust this up like a
normal<00:04:00.560> fraction<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.370> make<00:04:01.969> it<00:04:02.120> 8<00:04:02.359> over<00:04:02.629> 2

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
normal fraction and make it 8 over 2

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.839 
normal fraction and make it 8 over 2
plus<00:04:04.219> 4<00:04:04.639> over<00:04:04.939> to<00:04:05.739> stick<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.859> eye<00:04:06.889> in<00:04:07.219> there<00:04:07.400> so

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
plus 4 over to stick the eye in there so

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.250 
plus 4 over to stick the eye in there so
8<00:04:08.060> over<00:04:08.329> 2<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.689> 4<00:04:09.019> 4<00:04:09.379> over<00:04:10.250> 2<00:04:10.459> is<00:04:10.760> 2<00:04:10.849> I<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.019> that

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
8 over 2 is 4 4 over 2 is 2 I and that

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.289 
8 over 2 is 4 4 over 2 is 2 I and that
would<00:04:12.409> be<00:04:12.500> your<00:04:12.620> solution<00:04:12.949> so<00:04:13.939> if<00:04:14.150> you're

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
would be your solution so if you're

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.039 
would be your solution so if you're
dividing<00:04:14.569> by<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:15.019> part<00:04:15.379> that<00:04:15.829> just<00:04:16.099> has<00:04:16.340> an<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
dividing by a part that just has an a a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.420 
dividing by a part that just has an a a
real<00:04:18.530> number<00:04:18.769> that's<00:04:19.310> all<00:04:19.519> you'd<00:04:19.699> have<00:04:19.849> to<00:04:19.910> do

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
real number that's all you'd have to do

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.420 
real number that's all you'd have to do
okay<00:04:22.430> but<00:04:22.699> in<00:04:22.849> this<00:04:23.060> example<00:04:23.449> there<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.259> this<00:04:25.070> 4

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
okay but in this example there is this 4

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.100 
okay but in this example there is this 4
minus<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.330> what<00:04:26.570> we<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.840> in<00:04:26.990> the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
minus I and what we do in the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.839 
minus I and what we do in the
denominator<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.949> multiply<00:04:28.099> by<00:04:28.820> the

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
denominator you multiply by the

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.760 
denominator you multiply by the
conjugate<00:04:29.240> basically<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.320> want<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.530> try<00:04:30.710> to

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
conjugate basically you want to try to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.420 
conjugate basically you want to try to
get<00:04:30.919> rid<00:04:30.979> of<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:32.169> stuff<00:04:33.169> in<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:33.440> bottom<00:04:33.800> so

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
get rid of the stuff in the bottom so

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.310 
get rid of the stuff in the bottom so
I'm<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.729> multiply<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.270> denominator<00:04:35.479> by

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
I'm going to multiply the denominator by

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.700 
I'm going to multiply the denominator by
4<00:04:36.710> plus<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.699> the<00:04:38.300> conjugate<00:04:38.780> again<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.530> just

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
4 plus I and the conjugate again is just

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.159 
4 plus I and the conjugate again is just
when<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.979> leave<00:04:40.570> basically<00:04:41.570> whatever<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.080> is

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
when you leave basically whatever it is

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.050 
when you leave basically whatever it is
you<00:04:42.409> just<00:04:42.590> flip<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.099> sign<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.580> middle<00:04:43.639> if

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
you just flip the sign in the middle if

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.390 
you just flip the sign in the middle if
I<00:04:44.750> multiply<00:04:45.289> it<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.530> bottom<00:04:45.979> I'm<00:04:46.159> going<00:04:46.340> to

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
I multiply it to the bottom I'm going to

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.230 
I multiply it to the bottom I'm going to
have<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.610> multiply<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.389> top<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:49.210> now<00:04:50.210> I

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
have to multiply it to the top and now I

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.180 
have to multiply it to the top and now I
need<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.570> foil<00:04:50.930> at<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.199> top<00:04:51.409> so<00:04:51.650> I'll<00:04:51.740> get<00:04:51.949> 4

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
need to foil at the top so I'll get 4

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.219 
need to foil at the top so I'll get 4
times<00:04:52.430> 5<00:04:52.789> which<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:53.810> 25<00:04:54.639> times<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:55.909> is<00:04:56.270> 5<00:04:56.659> I<00:04:56.690> on

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
times 5 which is 25 times I is 5 I on

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.149 
times 5 which is 25 times I is 5 I on
the<00:04:58.039> inside<00:04:58.370> I'll<00:04:58.610> get<00:04:58.789> positive<00:04:59.030> 8i<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.470> then

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
the inside I'll get positive 8i and then

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.899 
the inside I'll get positive 8i and then
on<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.400> outside<00:05:01.909> I'll<00:05:02.180> get<00:05:02.360> positive<00:05:02.630> 2<00:05:03.289> I

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
on the outside I'll get positive 2 I

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.420 
on the outside I'll get positive 2 I
squared<00:05:04.909> when<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.240> foil<00:05:05.630> out<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.840> numerator

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
squared when I foil out the numerator

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.279 
squared when I foil out the numerator
when<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.460> foil<00:05:07.849> out<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.210> denominator<00:05:08.840> I'll<00:05:09.139> get

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
when I foil out the denominator I'll get

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.159 
when I foil out the denominator I'll get
16<00:05:10.720> plus<00:05:11.720> 4<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.139> minus<00:05:13.120> 4i<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.630> then<00:05:14.930> I'll<00:05:15.020> have

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
16 plus 4 I minus 4i and then I'll have

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.779 
16 plus 4 I minus 4i and then I'll have
a<00:05:15.199> negative<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.889> squared<00:05:16.460> term<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:18.159> on<00:05:19.159> top<00:05:19.460> we

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
a negative I squared term so on top we

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.820 
a negative I squared term so on top we
have<00:05:20.919> 25<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.400> 8i<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:23.289> 13<00:05:24.289> I

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
have 25 I and 8i is 13 I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.040 
have 25 I and 8i is 13 I
and<00:05:25.920> then<00:05:26.490> we'll<00:05:26.640> have<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.120> squared<00:05:27.780> which<00:05:27.900> is

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
and then we'll have I squared which is

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.190 
and then we'll have I squared which is
negative<00:05:28.200> one<00:05:28.830> on<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:30.660> bottom<00:05:31.050> we<00:05:31.170> have

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
negative one on the bottom we have

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.100 
negative one on the bottom we have
sixteen<00:05:32.010> notice<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.730> positive<00:05:32.940> 4i<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.990> the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
sixteen notice the positive 4i and the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.850 
sixteen notice the positive 4i and the
negative<00:05:34.500> 4i<00:05:34.770> will<00:05:35.070> cancel<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.970> then<00:05:36.510> we<00:05:36.660> have

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
negative 4i will cancel and then we have

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.570 
negative 4i will cancel and then we have
minus<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.040> squared<00:05:38.640> which<00:05:38.730> is<00:05:38.880> negative<00:05:39.030> one<00:05:40.580> so

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
minus I squared which is negative one so

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.240 
minus I squared which is negative one so
on<00:05:41.700> top<00:05:41.910> we're<00:05:42.090> going<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.270> have<00:05:42.360> 20<00:05:42.780> minus<00:05:43.200> 2<00:05:43.710> or

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
on top we're going to have 20 minus 2 or

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.850 
on top we're going to have 20 minus 2 or
18<00:05:45.020> plus<00:05:46.020> 13<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:47.540> on<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.690> bottom<00:05:49.050> will<00:05:49.230> have<00:05:49.350> 16

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
18 plus 13 I on the bottom will have 16

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.570 
18 plus 13 I on the bottom will have 16
plus<00:05:50.160> 1<00:05:50.280> or<00:05:50.700> 17<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.630> now<00:05:52.530> we<00:05:52.920> can<00:05:53.130> just<00:05:53.250> bust

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
plus 1 or 17 and now we can just bust

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.360 
plus 1 or 17 and now we can just bust
this<00:05:53.820> up<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.270> make<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:54.540> 18<00:05:55.260> over<00:05:55.920> 17<00:05:57.020> plus<00:05:58.130> 13<00:05:59.130> I

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
this up and make it 18 over 17 plus 13 I

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.690 
this up and make it 18 over 17 plus 13 I
over<00:06:00.180> 17<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.350> since<00:06:02.040> that<00:06:02.190> doesn't<00:06:02.580> reduce

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
over 17 and since that doesn't reduce

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.430 
over 17 and since that doesn't reduce
that<00:06:03.690> will<00:06:03.870> be<00:06:03.990> our<00:06:04.140> solution<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.990> maybe<00:06:07.200> let's

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
that will be our solution so maybe let's

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.120 
that will be our solution so maybe let's
do<00:06:07.620> one<00:06:07.920> more<00:06:07.950> division<00:06:08.700> one<00:06:08.850> here<00:06:09.770> so<00:06:10.770> suppose

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
do one more division one here so suppose

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.480 
do one more division one here so suppose
it<00:06:11.340> was<00:06:11.490> 5<00:06:11.910> plus<00:06:12.750> 6i<00:06:13.910> /<00:06:14.910> just<00:06:15.480> I<00:06:16.100> well<00:06:17.100> in<00:06:17.310> this

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
it was 5 plus 6i / just I well in this

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.790 
it was 5 plus 6i / just I well in this
case<00:06:17.760> if<00:06:18.120> it's<00:06:18.360> not<00:06:18.540> just<00:06:18.780> a<00:06:18.960> real<00:06:19.200> number<00:06:19.410> you

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
case if it's not just a real number you

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.980 
case if it's not just a real number you
want<00:06:19.980> to<00:06:20.070> again<00:06:20.370> get<00:06:20.670> rid<00:06:20.820> of<00:06:20.970> the<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.090> they<00:06:21.570> for

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
want to again get rid of the I they for

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.350 
want to again get rid of the I they for
some<00:06:22.080> reason<00:06:22.440> we<00:06:22.530> don't<00:06:22.710> like<00:06:22.860> to<00:06:23.010> have

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
some reason we don't like to have

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.060 
some reason we don't like to have
imaginary<00:06:24.360> numbers<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.110> denominator<00:06:25.260> so

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
imaginary numbers in the denominator so

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.550 
imaginary numbers in the denominator so
what<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.000> could<00:06:27.180> multiply<00:06:27.330> by<00:06:27.870> here<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.410> we

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
what you could multiply by here is we

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.680 
what you could multiply by here is we
could<00:06:28.710> multiply<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:29.220> denominator<00:06:29.910> by<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.180> and

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
could multiply the denominator by I and

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.340 
could multiply the denominator by I and
the<00:06:31.170> top<00:06:31.440> also<00:06:31.770> by<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.600> so<00:06:33.600> in<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.780> numerator<00:06:33.930> I

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
the top also by I so in the numerator I

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.290 
the top also by I so in the numerator I
would<00:06:34.650> get<00:06:34.800> 5i<00:06:35.690> plus<00:06:36.690> 6i<00:06:37.440> squared<00:06:37.560> in<00:06:38.490> the

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
would get 5i plus 6i squared in the

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.770 
would get 5i plus 6i squared in the
denominator<00:06:39.450> I<00:06:39.990> would<00:06:40.290> get<00:06:40.440> I<00:06:40.560> squared

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
denominator I would get I squared

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.500 
denominator I would get I squared
okay<00:06:42.780> well<00:06:43.140> that's<00:06:43.290> 5i<00:06:43.770> again<00:06:44.550> I<00:06:44.730> squared<00:06:45.300> is

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
okay well that's 5i again I squared is

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.500 
okay well that's 5i again I squared is
negative<00:06:45.540> 1<00:06:46.010> so<00:06:47.010> negative<00:06:47.190> 1<00:06:47.550> times<00:06:47.580> 6<00:06:48.210> will

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
negative 1 so negative 1 times 6 will

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.470 
negative 1 so negative 1 times 6 will
give<00:06:48.600> us<00:06:48.780> well<00:06:49.260> negative<00:06:49.710> 6<00:06:50.220> on<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:51.330> bottom

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
give us well negative 6 on the bottom

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.120 
give us well negative 6 on the bottom
will<00:06:51.870> just<00:06:52.050> get<00:06:52.170> negative<00:06:52.410> 1<00:06:52.800> because<00:06:53.040> that's

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
will just get negative 1 because that's

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.120 
will just get negative 1 because that's
I<00:06:53.430> squared<00:06:53.840> so<00:06:54.840> if<00:06:54.930> I<00:06:55.020> break<00:06:55.290> this<00:06:55.500> up<00:06:55.710> I'll<00:06:56.010> get

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
I squared so if I break this up I'll get

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.600 
I squared so if I break this up I'll get
5i<00:06:56.520> over<00:06:57.180> negative<00:06:57.390> 1<00:06:57.810> on<00:06:58.110> the<00:06:58.650> top<00:06:58.860> a<00:06:58.890> positive

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
5i over negative 1 on the top a positive

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.450 
5i over negative 1 on the top a positive
and<00:06:59.730> a<00:06:59.790> negative<00:06:59.820> is<00:07:00.420> a<00:07:00.480> negative<00:07:01.160> 6<00:07:02.160> over

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
and a negative is a negative 6 over

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.330 
and a negative is a negative 6 over
negative<00:07:02.940> 1<00:07:03.390> and<00:07:03.720> that's<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.620> same<00:07:04.830> thing<00:07:05.100> as

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
negative 1 and that's the same thing as
