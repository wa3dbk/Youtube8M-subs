00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:26.419
 this mom threw him this yes mom 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:28.310
 Of course brand feed go-go 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.849
 shamil tell me where we are now 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.739
 are we are at summer camp 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:39.170
 but the whole chesky farm here on the mountain 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.449
 why is the camp so located from the point 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.090
 view that novices do not like dampness 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.300
 Generally it is first and secondly still 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.000
 here instead of such blown winds 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.350
 smaller than any midge mosquitoes and gadflies 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.339
 and gadflies so that they do not have to 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.399
 sun escape 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.199
 made such a closed canopy 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:07.100
 only and nothing else 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.110
 here we have one lamb mother threw and we 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:18.020
 he quietly feeds one 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:21.740
 just lost from mom manually growing 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.100
 and I see goats still here though 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 and he in every herd must be a cauldron 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.229
 leader leader here he is with us 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.399
 there he gave his wounds and the water comes out 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.420
 This is all important if you come again 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.500
 will start you 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.630
 fall and so on here so our horse 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.530
 the leader they say of the year too 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.520
 lambs of what breeds 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.780
 sheep mainly breed here 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.709
 it would start from the breed 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.049
 edilbaevskoy 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.539
 and this year she will only 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.440
 edilbaevskoy last year so accidentally 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.479
 it happened so we launched here 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.549
 cubic and there were so few 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.780
 Romanov breeds but this year we already 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.510
 here by the fall of all not pedigree of all remove 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 and leave only the kernels Bayevsky 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.790
 there is going on international 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.849
 crossbreeding and of course the results 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.720
 deteriorating performance and so about that 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:31.040
 for you edilbayevskoy better than me 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.290
 better than firstly the meat is not fat 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 because fat is all in the rump and remains 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.670
 secondly odorless to specific 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.239
 mutton smell and then we rams 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:49.100
 we cut 4 6 months still dairy 4 months 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.560
 we take them away from mamok and can and 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.340
 cut the weight they will have four months 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.190
 carcasses of carcass 20 kilograms on if 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 This system is personal from 25 to 30 kilograms. 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.850
 i.e 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.920
 Romanov breed is a maximum of 15 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.010
 kilogram know what benefits melts 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.940
 yes there is a nuance giving birth one by one only 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.069
 lamb 1 1 thousand so they all came out and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.490
 there is generally what is different 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.770
 fat tail 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.440
 sometimes they don't have tails just behind 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.860
 rump of lamb here even drive on 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.860
 him 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.980
 at least this is clearly not a mixture 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 some kind of because of the purebred aytbaev 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.620
 Scythian should not be a branch once or 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:37.220
 brown or black or a little like that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:41.070
 reddish color by crossbreed yes by 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.600
 places Romanovka yes probably white rather 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.750
 just not Romanovka here probably 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.510
 tried Kubish 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.970
 this is clear and now where is it going 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.610
 we will probably go watering now and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.280
 quietly begin to tweak weed time 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.400
 already peak for the fifth 5 hours in my 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.520
 approaching but the heat of the afternoon passed 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.300
 they themselves and someone not on grazing 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.140
 that is, they are here for a walk on grief 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.910
 eat as much as they want go 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.160
 watering from there go out you eat go 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:25.740
 that is, freedom that is granted 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:28.320
 yourself detailed sketch further on not 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.730
 less let's say so here it is on 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.540
 natural release 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.660
 and how many more times are there 400 heads 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.210
 400 bill this with a young or motor 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.090
 these are small tobago villages mostly 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.280
 magician probably only comet sheep well 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.280
 Yes, of course tribal up 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.750
 one year old and start here such spring 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.460
 was very hard 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.729
 rainy cheeses and even here here on the mountain 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.620
 there was cheese and some still limping it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.840
 Here hoof painfully develops from 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.210
 dampness and we certainly treat very severe 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.909
 the thing is dampness for Odessa 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740
 Well, yes, the option does not like dampness this field 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.009
 the more edilbaevskoy which they 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.090
 accustomed to dry access ruin pasture 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.759
 Well, not accustomed to something else in general sand and 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.819
 deadwood and by the way they are not weight starting 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.569
 recruit revealed August abruptly and here 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.919
 when the grass gets tough dry and 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:38.289
 then here 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:40.360
 unknown lose little one 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:47.849
 lost then she can't find 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.849
 I will go to her 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.150
 well here they are very spacious
