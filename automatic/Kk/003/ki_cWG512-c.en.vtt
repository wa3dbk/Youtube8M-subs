00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
night if not sold on so this is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.160 
night if not sold on so this is
basically<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.100> customized<00:01:14.909> weight<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.869> head

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.730 
basically a customized weight to my head
so<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.340> does<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.909> come<00:01:18.270> off<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:19.020> tight<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.619> my

so it does not come off it's tight on my
head<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.549> can't<00:01:20.880> fall<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.150> unless<00:01:21.750> something

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
head it can't fall off unless something

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
head it can't fall off unless something
really<00:01:22.140> pulls<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> hard<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.000> gonna<00:01:24.210> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
