00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to include it in this video because it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.720 
to include it in this video because it
would<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.470> made<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.800> video<00:02:40.980> incredibly

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
would have made this video incredibly

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.800 
would have made this video incredibly
long<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:44.400> showing<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.150> possible

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
long but I'm showing that it is possible

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.560 
long but I'm showing that it is possible
to<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.680> first<00:02:47.010> playthrough

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
to get it on your first playthrough

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.410 
to get it on your first playthrough
before<00:02:48.570> unlocking<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> other<00:02:50.700> masks

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
before unlocking some of the other masks

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.000 
before unlocking some of the other masks
there<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> mask<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.650> are<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
there is a mask that we are going to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.250 
there is a mask that we are going to
collect<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.210> chapter<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.020> will<00:02:55.140> be

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
on the next floor which is the third

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.090

floor I'll show you where that set and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.670 
floor I'll show you where that set and
once<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.150> beat<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.750> level<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> good

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
once you beat this level with a good

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
score you unlock the Zach the frog mask

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.240 
score you unlock the Zach the frog mask
which<00:03:05.600> gives<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> longer<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.320> combo<00:03:07.800> window

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
which gives you a longer a combo window

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.100 
which gives you a longer a combo window
and<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.640> lot<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.940> people<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.750> need<00:03:09.960> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
and a lot of people think they need to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.080 
and a lot of people think they need to
use<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.920> order<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.340> get<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.640> combo

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
use that in order to get that combo

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.840 
use that in order to get that combo
trophy<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:13.320> as<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:14.040> said<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.460> showing<00:03:14.760> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
trophy but as I said I'm showing you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.850 
trophy but as I said I'm showing you
that<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.180> actually<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.050> before

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that you can actually get it before

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.410 
that you can actually get it before
getting<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.030> actually<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.360> think

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
getting to that and actually I think

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.290 
getting to that and actually I think
this<00:03:18.720> method<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> lot<00:03:19.440> easier<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.280> set<00:03:21.150> off<00:03:21.270> a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
this method is a lot easier I set off a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.350 
this method is a lot easier I set off a
metal<00:03:21.810> detector<00:03:22.050> there<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.520> saw<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.910> method

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
metal detector there so I saw the method

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.790 
metal detector there so I saw the method
actually<00:03:24.630> somebody<00:03:25.050> else<00:03:25.230> had<00:03:25.380> posted<00:03:25.710> a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
actually somebody else had posted a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.260 
actually somebody else had posted a
video<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.640> like<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.150> really

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
video but it was like a really really

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.570 
video but it was like a really really
older<00:03:27.720> video<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.470> I'm<00:03:28.920> gonna<00:03:29.040> give<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.340> guy

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
older video and I'm gonna give that guy

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.380 
older video and I'm gonna give that guy
credit<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:31.520> I'm<00:03:32.520> gonna<00:03:32.730> talk<00:03:33.360> you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
credit for that but I'm gonna talk you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.150 
credit for that but I'm gonna talk you
through<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.990> real<00:03:34.170> slow<00:03:34.530> fashion<00:03:35.040> so

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
through it in a real slow fashion so
