00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 yes mature I don't think so 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 that you my age one more pop one that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.500
 plays on you you are you stay for child 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.290
 and keep that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.290
 Dad's squat therefore ssangyong 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.390
 we are actually much less prepared 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.150
 than his first go into my studio 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.500
 we already have everything all in all 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.380
 completely arranged in the menu 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.559
 actually noticed at the first session 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.059
 that it is actually very nice to have it 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.860
 a little spontaneous in study 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.790
 filling is to make it much less in advance 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.040
 to prepare already 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.540
 it used to be very much that as criticism 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.330
 point to there would say that very much 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.150
 people thought that every album sounded yes 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.739
 about the same or so and I think 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.870
 we still have already become adults 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.050
 and that is why this place feels like mine 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.239
 also much more like a new start than the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.700
 trainer on this third album I think so 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.050
 that you go a plate 1 and 2 absolute 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.450
 and not unimportant to you 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 is just going to be a completely new opportunity 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.080
 may hear that perhaps 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.770
 thanks to the collaboration with borne 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.039
 greats 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.600
 a kind of new phase in light i 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.050
 of course do many things really focused 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.850
 on radio and I try that with this one 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.890
 numbers also always give a touch 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.420
 that it still gets a chance to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.090
 driver to come 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.950
 and I do n't call it per se 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.740
 commercially I will make another coffee for sure 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.960
 not find a wrong word but I do 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.000
 the lake in the structures of the van 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 numbers that it is slightly more clear 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.619
 and you think that without it 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 to affect the best occasional profit 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.100
 to be met 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.000
 it also really sounds different we have 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.439
 we do need it so it is just 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.149
 important to him is that they always 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.890
 can do something else again 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.890
 to keep it fresh 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.000
 I also had a bit of a different one 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.250
 image of the boy himself 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 I also thought they might be something 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.060
 would be stiffer but actually be 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.500
 it just super sweet guys 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.760
 that is now the third album we put together 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.580
 I think it's becoming clearer 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.040
 becomes who influences which 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.020
 music and and how you are as a result 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.260
 hopefully a unique nick sound 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.260
 gets 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 plate one was the plate that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.340
 arose a bit around felix one 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.959
 idea of ​​going there now i'm going to give you something 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.760
 news start from the second album 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.689
 it is much more an organic event 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.700
 become 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.099
 so this especially on drummer in me too 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.719
 much more arranging and writing 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.239
 and now that is even more specific 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.980
 I really say but sometimes one 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.980
 fully inserted 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.240
 the song is called the burning de ground 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.860
 maybe the sign is for it 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.690
 writing process for me and it goes 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.250
 actually about that you are a bit one 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.709
 temporarily stuck on something 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 want to break and that too and give in this 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.010
 nice 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.350
 youtube and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.090
 of course you lay for yourself then 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.920
 I think it is very high or 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.660
 come for this you finally something 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.790
 let it be heard and 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.680
 and other people and for one or the other 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.120
 reason I had written a lot late 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.470
 time and I am just as slow is one 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.849
 little let people hear who liked it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.620
 pretty nice 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.239
 and that strengthens you in confidence with and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.310
 the outside world shows it has 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.500
 always a heavy side sounds 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.720
 happy time word sounds like paper 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.250
 but then when you dive into it, and you see that 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.769
 to have it bright dark undertone 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.390
 but now with the interaction that is that 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.660
 it has also received a spin 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.550
 and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.700
 yes this is just less for me 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.239
 unilateral because it is not all 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.239
 mine comes off 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.010
 I think it's completely mook but 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.180
 also 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.840
 Use 2012 now or later there too 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.720
 influences from yes 80s 70s such an me 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.880
 think we have done it ourselves too 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.990
 slightly more on the vocals 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.360
 more cords more 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.520
 yes catch catchy hooks in in the focus 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.600
 and that is not so often in the past 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.980
 been 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.460
 but i think it's kind of almost 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.130
 kind of ode to the plate is almost kind 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.000
 ode is to yes what a pop song is 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.980
 actually from a to b and clear and the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.690
 forces really is in the power 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.690
 origin in the primordial feeling of the song
