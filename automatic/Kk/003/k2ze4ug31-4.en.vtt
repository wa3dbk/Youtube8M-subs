00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
experience this is not good for someone

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.499 
experience this is not good for someone
that<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.490> lot<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:40.259> okay<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.289> will<00:01:41.619> say<00:01:41.799> this

that has a lot now okay I will say this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
that has a lot now okay I will say this
it's<00:01:43.509> not<00:01:44.109> good<00:01:44.439> for<00:01:44.469> someone<00:01:44.889> who<00:01:45.130> has<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.579> lot

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it's not good for someone who has a lot

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's not good for someone who has a lot
without<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.310> bra<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:49.060> believe<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:50.049> would<00:01:50.200> be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
without a bra I believe this would be

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.459

careful not to get it stuck on anything

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.690 
careful not to get it stuck on anything
right<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.770> positioned<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:45.980> part<00:02:46.370> right

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
right you positioned this part right

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.740 
right you positioned this part right
above<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:48.100> nipple<00:02:50.620> it's<00:02:51.620> not<00:02:51.830> going<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.100> be

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
above the nipple it's not going to be

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.180

very<00:02:53.750> easy<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.290> do<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.770> mannequin

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
very easy to do this on the mannequin

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.970 
very easy to do this on the mannequin
because<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.850> know<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:57.020> not<00:02:57.200> as<00:02:57.380> full<00:02:57.710> as<00:02:57.950> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
this and what you do now okay can you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.600 
this and what you do now okay can you
see<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:09.100> what<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:15.400> if<00:03:16.400> this

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
see that what you do now is you if this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.390 
see that what you do now is you if this
was<00:03:16.880> real<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.990> would<00:03:18.140> pull<00:03:18.470> take<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.070> part

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
was real you would pull take this part

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.370 
was real you would pull take this part
right<00:03:19.580> here<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.060> lift<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.810> brick<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.230> would

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
right here and lift the brick you would

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.530 
right here and lift the brick you would
actually<00:03:21.770> lift<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.700> press<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.390> would

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
actually lift the press and it would

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.720 
actually lift the press and it would
raise<00:03:23.840> up<00:03:24.430> kill<00:03:25.430> off<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:27.220> rest<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:29.290> lift

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
raise up kill off the rest of the lift

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.600 
raise up kill off the rest of the lift
the<00:03:31.730> top<00:03:32.060> part<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:33.620> not<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.980> easy<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.430> the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
the top part it's not as easy on the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.750 
the top part it's not as easy on the
mannequin<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.300> person<00:03:35.750> but<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.760> certainly

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
mannequin as a person but I certainly

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.870 
mannequin as a person but I certainly
couldn't<00:03:38.030> demonstrate<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.900> live<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.880> anyway

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
couldn't demonstrate it live so anyway

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.180 
couldn't demonstrate it live so anyway
take<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.390> off<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.050> would<00:03:42.739> take<00:03:43.040> this

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
take this off and you would take this

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.550 
take this off and you would take this
and<00:03:43.430> pull<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.239> into<00:03:44.800> position<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:47.360> you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and pull it into position and then you

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.070 
and pull it into position and then you
put<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.650> up<00:03:48.770> here<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.540> naturally<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.810> can't

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
put it up here so naturally you can't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960 
put it up here so naturally you can't
really<00:03:51.320> see<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.620> being<00:03:51.680> lifted<00:03:52.190> by<00:03:52.550> just<00:03:52.790> try

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
really see this being lifted by just try

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.360 
really see this being lifted by just try
and<00:03:53.030> demonstrate<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.470> were<00:03:54.590> taking<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
and demonstrate that you were taking and

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610 
and demonstrate that you were taking and
this<00:03:55.940> right<00:03:56.239> here<00:03:56.420> will<00:03:56.570> actually<00:03:56.900> lift<00:03:57.380> up

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
this right here will actually lift up

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.150 
this right here will actually lift up
because<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:58.670> would<00:03:58.790> be<00:03:58.910> listening<00:03:59.090> up

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
because you you would be listening up

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.550 
because you you would be listening up
like<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.690> would<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.810> lifted<00:04:03.050> up<00:04:03.320> and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
like this and it would be lifted up and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.190 
like this and it would be lifted up and
it<00:04:03.890> actually<00:04:04.190> did<00:04:04.670> work<00:04:04.970> on<00:04:05.239> me<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.989> only

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
it actually did work on me the only

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
it actually did work on me the only
problem<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.890> had<00:04:07.190> was<00:04:07.520> not<00:04:08.420> having<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.870> bra

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
problem that I had was not having a bra

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160 
problem that I had was not having a bra
and<00:04:10.220> then<00:04:10.820> like<00:04:11.239> your<00:04:11.420> nipple<00:04:11.930> showing

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
and then like your nipple showing

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.380 
and then like your nipple showing
through<00:04:12.530> your<00:04:12.560> clothing<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.030> cool

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
through your clothing that's not cool

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.380 
through your clothing that's not cool
umm<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.830> it's<00:04:16.100> best<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.640> think<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:17.180> wear

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
umm so it's best I think to wear

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.260 
umm so it's best I think to wear
something<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.900> nothing<00:04:21.830> else<00:04:22.040> but<00:04:23.030> it

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
something for that nothing else but it

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.320 
something for that nothing else but it
did<00:04:23.510> lift<00:04:23.840> me<00:04:24.169> after<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.130> while<00:04:25.400> though

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
did lift me after a while though

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.689 
did lift me after a while though
it<00:04:26.690> was<00:04:27.380> just<00:04:27.620> too

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
it was just too

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.580 
it was just too
I<00:04:28.729> was<00:04:29.270> just<00:04:29.479> too<00:04:29.630> much<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.139> lives<00:04:30.350> that's

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
I was just too much for the lives that's

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.189 
I was just too much for the lives that's
all<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.740> gotta<00:04:31.010> say<00:04:31.100> kind<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.449> kind<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.930> um

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
all I gotta say kind of it kind of um

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.310 
all I gotta say kind of it kind of um
tore<00:04:33.710> after<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.460> while<00:04:34.760> but<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.540> didn't<00:04:36.050> have<00:04:36.139> any

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
tore after a while but I didn't have any

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.939 
tore after a while but I didn't have any
support<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:38.030> there<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.840> go<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.290> think<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.680> is

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
support so there you go I think that is

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.879 
support so there you go I think that is
worth<00:04:40.190> trying<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.330> worth<00:04:41.540> having<00:04:42.050> because<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
worth trying and worth having because it

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.980 
worth trying and worth having because it
may<00:04:43.220> come<00:04:43.520> in<00:04:43.669> handy<00:04:43.699> for<00:04:44.150> something<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.870> you
