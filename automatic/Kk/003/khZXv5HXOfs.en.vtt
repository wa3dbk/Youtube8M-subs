00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.709
 Hello, how are you guys? 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.990
 the best to the people how are they waiting 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.090
 distend the best 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello, how are you guys? 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.380
 of the best and today guys 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 I bring this little tutorial in the 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.300
 which are we going to learn how to improve both 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 the quality of our voice is already for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.490
 our gameplays for our blogs or 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.150
 for what we need it is worth and then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.430
 well let's start good guys here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.040
 I already have like him before 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.800
 they listened then now what are we going to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.430
 to do is open a new audio track 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.320
 and I'm going to duplicate it so why 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.130
 because if I put it up here it's going to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.340
 listen without editing it is worth then here 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.470
 we already have it duplicated it's worth then 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180
 you are not going to have to do this 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.550
 you the only thing they're going to have to 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.330
 to do is what I 'm going to say to 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.360
 then it's worth we just put 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.670
 in the lane where our voice is and 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.369
 try not to put it where is the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.500
 music and that is, that channel quoted 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.050
 you know only for the voice because if you 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.020
 they put music or effects or other things right there 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.780
 things are going to hear different this 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.640
 is exclusively for the voice is worth it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.640
 later I do not know if I will bring them another 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.920
 then as good tutorial once 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 we have located the channel of our voice 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.729
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.729
 go to this part where are the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.070
 Decibels and we're going to come to this 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.640
 tool which is called effects of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.039
 we are going to click and here we are 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.110
 will open this tab the first thing that 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.050
 we must do is that we are going to go to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.880
 this other little tab that says equalizer 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.850
 of track 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.340
 and once here what we are going to do is 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.159
 what are we going to give him in this 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 the little arrow that is down and you 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.569
 let's add the notch effect in 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 60 buzz I do not know what that is 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.640
 using 400 enlarged or stacked is worth the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.370
 joke is that we add that guys and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.890
 now let's add another plugin 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.489
 how are we going to add we are going to come 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 to this icon called chain 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.769
 of plugins once here we are going to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.250
 open all the plugins that brings 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.019
 by efe by default the sony vegas does not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.329
 I've got some other plugin worth 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.870
 then this one sure that they are going to 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.180
 find and then as good what 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.510
 follow is that we're going to go to this 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.010
 effect that says express audio fx 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 restoration we are going to give in adding and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.230
 then to accept once we are 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.040
 here you guys what are you going to have 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.709
 what to do 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.010
 move all the settings to how I the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.260
 I have already saved it is worth first in 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.859
 amount of click removal you 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.180
 let's give in 1 audio reduction you 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:13.700
 we will give in 5.2 decibels frequencies 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.150
 affected we will give you nothing more in 100 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.569
 oysters at minimum attack speed 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.700
 we're going to put it in 20 which is the maximum 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.060
 speed the rileys what are we going to put 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.430
 equal in 20 and the noise floor we're going 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.810
 to put in minus 58.30 cibeles worth 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.720
 then since we have all these 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.540
 states this saved configuration what 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.000
 that we are going to put here is for example and 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.629
 like me here I put a man 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.270
 which is better microphone quality 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.810
 then then we are going to fall 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.120
 here in default save and as you see 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.270
 is going to create us this is worth 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.820
 So what we are going to do is that 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.900
 we are going to close it and we are already changed 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.180
 Well, the quality of our audio is 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.750
 very little the difference you get 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.500
 but minimal is something guys and believe me if 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.049
 yes, it shows so much then 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.680
 also remember that well this 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.870
 has several consequences or is good 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.690
 that can improve it 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.350
 putting yourself I do not know somewhere in the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.030
 which there are no air currents not 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.460
 they exist so they are not going through 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.520
 there people or things like that is also worth 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.139
 those things make it so good if 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.560
 listen a little better the voice is worth 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.510
 So, guys, I'm chicken crazy 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.330
