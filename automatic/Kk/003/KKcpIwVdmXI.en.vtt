00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.649
 and today we will talk with you about this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.260
 recent innovations like marks on 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.019
 guns tell more about 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.960
 the mechanics of charging this mark all 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.660
 calculations are starting with the release of the update 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 91 what is the most interesting thing 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 indicator to get marks on 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 guns is the average total damage 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.080
 what does this mean total mean 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.140
 damage is your main damage plus damage by 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 for your light damage, plus assist in fu 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.469
 a caterpillar track minus damage done 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.450
 according to the allies everything is very simple further 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.329
 going to average statistics for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 the last few days or rather 7 days 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.960
 and calculated boundary indicators 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 65 percent average damage 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 85-95 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.079
 exceeding which user gets 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 deserved a number of labels exceed 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 and 65 percent damage indicators 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 players will get one star 85 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.180
 exceed get 2 95 enter five 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.780
 percent of players for damage that is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 get as many as possible three marks 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.350
 statistics going over the last chair 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 battles on the tank but for an experienced player 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 it may be enough to spend 72 to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.930
 example to exceed the indicator 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 95 percent of the players and get three 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.720
 marks roughly speaking every fight changes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 Player component with a weight of one-hundredth as 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.030
 first hundred battles form a skill score 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 player follow-up battles after first 100 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.280
 continue to change the result to great 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.590
 side if more damage is received 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.990
 average skill grows or less if 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.090
 damage less than average for 1 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 100 battles skill so let's say decreases 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.590
 indicator is displayed for each 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.750
 tank in the achievement of technology 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.020
 explicit reward your score 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.369
 damage is better than y percent of players 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 the same tanks 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.960
 also you can turn off the marks but 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.509
 only for your tank mark of others 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.780
 the player you will always see in the end 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.710
 more simply need to keep as much as possible 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 high total damage 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.690
 about which we spoke at the beginning of the extreme 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.550
 100 fights for maximum 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.490
 result 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.100
 much information but nothing at all 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.740
 there is no difficulty in keeping good 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.680
 damage 100 krayany last fights and you 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.040
 get your deserved three marks 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 which I wish you and I hope you all 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.209
 it became clear and understandable to all thanks that
