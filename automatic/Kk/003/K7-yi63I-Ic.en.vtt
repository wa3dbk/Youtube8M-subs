hey guys so today I want to tell you a

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.470 
hey guys so today I want to tell you a
little<00:00:01.829> bit<00:00:02.100> about<00:00:02.399> why<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.820> might<00:00:03.060> want<00:00:03.210> to

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
little bit about why you might want to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.630 
little bit about why you might want to
avoid<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.959> lip<00:00:04.259> gloss<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.009> summer<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.490> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
avoid the lip gloss for the summer and I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.220 
avoid the lip gloss for the summer and I
have<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.850> say<00:00:05.879> I'm<00:00:06.150> guilty<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.839> I'm<00:00:06.960> wearing

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
have to say I'm guilty of it I'm wearing

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680 
have to say I'm guilty of it I'm wearing
lip<00:00:07.500> gloss<00:00:07.529> right<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> lip

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
lip gloss right now and I think the lip

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
lip gloss right now and I think the lip
gloss<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.080> kind<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.410> like<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> girl's<00:00:10.860> best

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
gloss is kind of like a girl's best

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.740 
gloss is kind of like a girl's best
friend<00:00:11.280> whether<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.880> love<00:00:12.150> makeup<00:00:12.540> or

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
friend whether you love makeup or

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.330 
friend whether you love makeup or
whether<00:00:12.900> you're<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.320> kind<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> into<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
whether you're just kind of into it I

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
whether you're just kind of into it I
think<00:00:14.400> every<00:00:14.910> girl<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> lip<00:00:15.719> gloss<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.170> think

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
think every girl has a lip gloss I think

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
think every girl has a lip gloss I think
it's<00:00:16.500> kind<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.859> go-to<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.449> daily

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's kind of a go-to in a lot of daily

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
it's kind of a go-to in a lot of daily
routines<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.920> spur

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
routines just because it can spur

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.950 
routines just because it can spur
somewhat<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.210> much<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.750> little

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
somewhat up so much with so little

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410 
somewhat up so much with so little
effort<00:00:22.289> here's<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> problem<00:00:23.699> yeah<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
effort here's the problem yeah this

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050 
effort here's the problem yeah this
isn't<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:25.019> lip<00:00:25.350> glosses<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.160> most<00:00:26.640> lip

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
isn't for all lip glosses but most lip

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
isn't for all lip glosses but most lip
glosses<00:00:27.410> actually<00:00:28.410> are<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> great<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
glosses actually are not that great for

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
glosses actually are not that great for
the<00:00:29.670> lips<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.330> very<00:00:30.359> dry<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the lips they can be very dry and the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.680 
the lips they can be very dry and the
worst<00:00:32.189> part<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.120> cause<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
worst part is that they can cause the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870 
worst part is that they can cause the
lips<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> soak<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.250> sun<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
lips to kind of soak up the sun and the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.959 
lips to kind of soak up the sun and the
UV<00:00:36.329> rays<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:37.350> than<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.649> should<00:00:37.790> I'm<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
UV rays more than they should I'm and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
UV rays more than they should I'm and
that<00:00:39.059> isn't<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.480> lip<00:00:39.719> gloss<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.350> some

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that isn't all lip gloss there are some

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
that isn't all lip gloss there are some
that<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.739> great<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.190> SPF<00:00:41.640> lipsticks<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that are great to have SPF lipsticks and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.299 
that are great to have SPF lipsticks and
chap<00:00:43.140> sticks<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.649> generally<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.219> bit

chap sticks are generally a little bit

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
chap sticks are generally a little bit
safer<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.200> lip

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
safer but if you take a look at your lip
