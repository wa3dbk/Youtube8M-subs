 this video well found in this video 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 I'm just the comment and represents 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.060
 a really emerging emerging channel 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.350
 very similar to what I know the school team 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.600
 we are a gaming group 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 mainly on call of duty m13 we are 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 in fact, they specialize in modern warfare 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550
 3 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 we really have gameplay 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.770
 fantastic stratospheric like this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.920
 today we bring you this fantastic 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 community channel knock out 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 thanks to the staff but this was it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.059
 under the weight it goes well it is a double moab 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 deathmatch team deathmatch 6 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 against 6 played data pirates some 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.039
 another saying of ak47 of course there was a 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 very organized game team however the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 our gaming team, if nothing else, was there 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.100
 even some stranger member anyway 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.710
 our friend of the blunt kind if not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 then we were all of ours 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.860
 our team 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 I was there left to us to weigh born 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.119
 storm abarth for anyone he had 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.740
 met maybe in games because 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.630
 are really so many years that I play call 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.060
 of duty greet me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.680
 in the comments writing his psn e 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.930
 anyway the game I was playing 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 briefly speaking is a beautiful one 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.189
 match in fact as you will imagine 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 however those who see the most video 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.520
 on the cell communities those who 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 they watched that Italy over power that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.970
 loaded this kind of gameplay of yours 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.799
 while the double mobs of acr various north ad 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.369
 bus thing of the team match of six 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.439
 against six 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.960
 they have been seen very few and those 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.659
 few if you have seen you are seen with 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.180
 with the cr 6.8 then with a study 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.570
 I'm not here to give cheers anyway 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.930
 too much this gameplay but anyway it's for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.280
 tell you that believe me it's not very easy 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.119
 do it even if we on the second first 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 attempt 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.899
 we succeeded because in any case bayern 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 expert player then under mine 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 tion of my cooking tips 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.079
 team 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.750
 we managed to with shields and le 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.489
 infiltrations to cover him well and him 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 having the match succeeded 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.719
 easily to accomplish this 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.609
 gameplay I don't know but to show you the 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.680
 class because the boys would not have 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.720
 much sense 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.540
 after years after the game came out not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.879
 it makes a lot of sense indeed and above all 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.549
 staying were the bows anyway game 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.530
 I was jean health of vests like 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.900
 see at the beginning of the game for those more 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.329
 be careful or I made a absurd triple 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.569
 that I did a little piss off mine and I have 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.310
 then placed my team because 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.709
 because I like doing things right 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.560
 sometimes mine may not like it 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.299
 game team because I have my ideas 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.519
 very often as in this game 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.290
 they work because doing the triple one 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.010
 and that other than initial if it succeeded 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 to give cured on bottle by abd 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.709
 which then during his mode series 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.569
 for the creams for the two mobs he managed to 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.909
 do them a lot more times 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.949
 simple and maybe even relaxed because 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.720
 however we are always on the game we have to 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.359
 having fun even second must do a 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.069
 gameplay for youtube can not can not 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.590
 to set oneself up like a madman 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.419
 although a little once in a lifetime come on 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.669
 we did it, we all rent it 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.370
 at least I hope someone besides me 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.549
 I did it otherwise I'm wondering 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.870
 a little bit you are a little stupid or otherwise 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.209
 as you can see there are clashes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.760
 indeed, very close together 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.919
 he really performs in a few moments 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.349
 of the gameplay who performs a massacre 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.400
 meanwhile immediately as the very first mob 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.169
 fast 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.940
 an absurd massacre when a film does not 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.389
 manages to commit suicide because of my su 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.560
 loot that they do that always do a little 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.510
 angry 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.000
 in fact for anyone who wanted to try 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.519
 this gameplay gives you a class 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.139
 really fantastic with the shield too 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.090
 if I had said that I would not have said but 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.549
 I said I wouldn't say sorry 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.370
 repetition than I would have no 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.380
 I would have mentioned but in short by the ifs 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.659
 someone wanted to try it even if mq 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.690
 I don't recommend three guys so much 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:24.280
 because we like it but it is really slow 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.069
 d area the lobby plan xp 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.469
 or in any case clean-up matches and are not 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:35.060
 which are not very pleasant the appears 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:36.319
 my and in fact behold it is beautiful but up to a 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.639
 certain point also because there is not 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.110
 imagine why I play a child from 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.599
 years leave various lobbies 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.150
 quite the contrary, very many 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.430
 groups with acerra assassin come to 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.960
 ruin your normal games now 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.460
 we got used to it we don't do of 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.719
 this kind of problem 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.729
 however I'm sure the game was 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.770
 much nicer a year ago with a 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.180
 ect and a half also makes one out of the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.889
 period of play at that time was 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.229
 unplayable they all used fmg nova 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.990
 kimbo as you will remember in fact 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.529
 end our and call of duty appears 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.020
 better but also according to many knows it and 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.870
 at the beginning a lot of people 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.060
 they really hated it and then the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.849
 realizing that it was the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.909
 game that guaranteed more but 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.589
 greater freedom of play greater 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:25.779
 more fun indeed there are 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:28.610
 three action reward packages of 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.289
 last and hicks when I'm on my own 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.689
 last hickson always killstreak 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.289
 however, killstreaks too 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.969
 conquer the flags you could 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.729
 benefit your series so yes 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:44.180
 they can then call nstreet more 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.300
 exactly and the class I had 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.759
 mentioned a little while ago and of which I have not 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.560
 still said nothing after minutes is one 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.729
 class with the riot shield with a 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.810
 melee in case there was from 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.689
 destroy by pulling a shield 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.990
 someone to kill him to procure 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:05.930
 vests to the member who wanted to try 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.750
 the gameplay then anti-riot shield 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.210
 with melee then a p 99 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.740
 silenced to shoot now I'll explain 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.259
 that because with more scout 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.360
 flexible pro predator pro 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.909
 possibly a person or two with one 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.050
 bouncing betti and then all with 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.759
 with infiltrations or with flex 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.529
 I keep this guys stunned 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.250
 you decide it regarding the 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.259
 lethal 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.110
 the lethal ata the secondary tactic 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.510
 and go to the bosses us 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.190
 and that's all, these are the things that 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.350
 you have to manage a little with yours 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.640
 group especially also because if one 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.110
 map as hard to you being a lot 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.360
 small infiltration is not much 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.340
 useful but it is very useful and reconnaissance 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.210
 pro that allows you to report the 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:54.200
 target on the pd map with the version 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.020
 also pro to color it on the map 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.810
 so I advise you to use it 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.390
 that is, you need a really expert team 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.660
 does not want to try this menu clay points 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.370
 this kind of gameplay easily here 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.640
 try now with this class 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.450
 it really works predator delays 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.240
 the explosive detection then how 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.220
 the Italian says maybe they pulled you one 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.320
 bones in betti was a claymore mine 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.670
 disturb yours at the exit of 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.980
 in short, the match will be longer 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.320
 easy to manage not to make it explode e 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.000
 so to survive they thank kohout
