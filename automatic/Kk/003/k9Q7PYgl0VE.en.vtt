at<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.610> park<00:00:48.899> shredding<00:00:49.899> them<00:00:49.989> out<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:51.159> love

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
at the park shredding them out I love

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.840 
at the park shredding them out I love
them<00:00:51.969> absolutely<00:00:52.769> because<00:00:53.769> I<00:00:54.010> could<00:00:54.190> not<00:00:54.309> gain

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
them absolutely because I could not gain

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.700 
them absolutely because I could not gain
the<00:00:55.059> speeds<00:00:55.359> in<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.570> sand<00:00:55.929> that<00:00:56.019> I<00:00:56.140> do<00:00:56.260> with<00:00:56.679> my

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
the speeds in the sand that I do with my

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.619 
the speeds in the sand that I do with my
trenches<00:00:57.280> or<00:00:57.460> even<00:00:57.699> badlands<00:00:58.269> I<00:00:58.359> mean<00:00:58.510> you'd

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
trenches or even badlands I mean you'd

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.150 
trenches or even badlands I mean you'd
probably<00:00:58.660> be<00:00:59.170> better<00:00:59.350> off<00:00:59.559> with<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.739> Badlands

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
probably be better off with the Badlands

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.270 
probably be better off with the Badlands
and<00:01:00.370> these<00:01:00.550> are<00:01:01.420> um<00:01:01.690> then<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.379> trenches<00:01:03.039> and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
and these are um then the trenches and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.070 
and these are um then the trenches and
Sandy<00:01:03.579> gimlet<00:01:03.969> but<00:01:04.570> if<00:01:04.690> you<00:01:04.780> know<00:01:04.960> you're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
Sandy gimlet but if you know you're

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.540 
Sandy gimlet but if you know you're
gonna<00:01:05.170> be<00:01:05.259> driving<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.649> sand<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.979> whole<00:01:06.009> time

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550

get a pair of these all right if you're
gonna<00:01:08.560> be<00:01:08.800> reversing<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.759> wouldn't

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
gonna be reversing on I wouldn't

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.690 
gonna be reversing on I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.509> because<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:11.679> know<00:01:11.830> as

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
recommend it because you know as

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
recommend it because you know as
reversing<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.330> lose<00:01:13.570> everything<00:01:13.929> as<00:01:14.229> soon<00:01:14.409> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
reversing you lose everything as soon as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.219 
reversing you lose everything as soon as
in<00:01:15.700> Reverse<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.390> know<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:16.750> sliding<00:01:17.020> on

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
in Reverse and you know it's sliding on

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.419 
in Reverse and you know it's sliding on
the<00:01:17.320> smooth<00:01:17.530> part<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.890> tire<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.130> whole

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
the smooth part of the tire the whole

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.700 
the smooth part of the tire the whole
entire<00:01:18.700> time<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.259> no<00:01:20.440> traction

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
entire time you have no traction

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.020 
entire time you have no traction
whatsoever<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:22.539> so<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.460> mean<00:01:24.520> these<00:01:24.759> tires

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
these have so much traction and it's

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.510 
these have so much traction and it's
just<00:01:33.970> flailing<00:01:34.329> off<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.740> bit<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.159> mean<00:01:36.340> if

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
pretty hard Easter tales I would

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.420 
pretty hard Easter tales I would
recommend<00:01:40.930> like<00:01:41.110> taking<00:01:41.439> off<00:01:41.530> your<00:01:41.680> mud<00:01:42.219> flaps

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
recommend like taking off your mud flaps

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.249 
recommend like taking off your mud flaps
or<00:01:42.520> whatever<00:01:42.759> if<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.719> still<00:01:43.930> have<00:01:44.049> them<00:01:44.200> on

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
or whatever if you still have them on

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.709 
or whatever if you still have them on
your<00:01:44.380> icy<00:01:44.590> tank<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:45.040> mean<00:01:45.640> like<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:46.030> taught<00:01:46.600> my

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
your icy tank I mean like I taught my

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:47.819 
your icy tank I mean like I taught my
bumper<00:01:47.020> down<00:01:47.140> because<00:01:47.500> I'm<00:01:47.560> gonna<00:01:47.649> start

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
bumper down because I'm gonna start

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.630 
bumper down because I'm gonna start
racing<00:01:48.040> but<00:01:49.030> um<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.920> would<00:01:51.280> recommend<00:01:51.579> taking

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
racing but um I would recommend taking

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.340 
racing but um I would recommend taking
them<00:01:51.880> off<00:01:51.969> because<00:01:52.119> these<00:01:52.420> will<00:01:52.659> shred<00:01:53.020> your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
them off because these will shred your

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.490 
them off because these will shred your
mud<00:01:53.590> flaps<00:01:53.829> like<00:01:54.070> there's<00:01:54.369> nothing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
mud flaps like there's nothing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
mud flaps like there's nothing
