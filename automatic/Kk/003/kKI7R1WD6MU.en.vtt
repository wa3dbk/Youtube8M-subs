00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
sitting in my refrigerator for a little

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.880 
sitting in my refrigerator for a little
bit<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.940> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> forgot<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.989> yeah

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
bit and I kind of forgot about them yeah

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
bit and I kind of forgot about them yeah
um<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.820> cut<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> part<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
um but I just cut off to that part you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
um but I just cut off to that part you
could<00:00:54.809> still<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> rest<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.800> very

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
could still use the rest it's not very

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
could still use the rest it's not very
hard<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> cabbage<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
hard at all because the cabbage that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
hard at all because the cabbage that
comes<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> layers<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.379> peel<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
comes in layers you just peel off the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.729 
comes in layers you just peel off the
bad<00:00:58.949> orange<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> slip<00:00:59.640> inside<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> cut

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bad orange and you slip inside you cut

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.969 
bad orange and you slip inside you cut
the<00:01:01.859> cabbage<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.820> along<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.019> slave<00:01:04.260> leaving

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the cabbage and along the slave leaving

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.660 
the cabbage and along the slave leaving
out<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.129> core

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
out the core

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
out the core
it<00:01:06.630> doesn't<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.049> matter<00:01:07.320> how<00:01:07.590> small<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it doesn't really matter how small you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
it doesn't really matter how small you
cut<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.750> break<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.110> even

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
cut it because it will break up even

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620 
cut it because it will break up even
smaller<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> ready<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.570> I'm

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
smaller when you get it ready so I'm

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
smaller when you get it ready so I'm
just<00:01:12.840> cutting<00:01:13.020> wide<00:01:13.530> strips<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
just cutting wide strips like that and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.800 
just cutting wide strips like that and
then<00:01:16.700> once<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.850> finish<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.689> both

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
then once I finish doing this for both

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
then once I finish doing this for both
heads<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> cabbage<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:21.030> we'll<00:01:21.330> move<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
heads of cabbage then we'll move on to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499 
heads of cabbage then we'll move on to

in some salt I'm not measuring exactly

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.930 
in some salt I'm not measuring exactly
how<00:02:23.420> much<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:24.500> I'll<00:02:24.920> fix<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.430> amount<00:02:25.820> of

how much because I'll fix this amount of

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.130 
how much because I'll fix this amount of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
little bit of course shell and then

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.650 
little bit of course shell and then
start<00:02:29.150> pounding

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
start pounding

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.690 
start pounding
once<00:02:30.320> you've<00:02:30.470> pounded<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> crap<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.340> lot<00:02:31.430> of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
once you've pounded the crap a lot of

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.490 
once you've pounded the crap a lot of
the<00:02:31.790> way<00:02:31.910> then<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.600> start<00:02:32.840> using<00:02:32.960> your<00:02:33.140> hands

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the way then you start using your hands

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.490 
the way then you start using your hands
it's<00:02:34.160> really<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:35.510> hard<00:02:35.690> work<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:36.200> it's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's really a little hard work but it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.130 
it's really a little hard work but it's
also<00:02:36.800> worth<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.540> lets<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.960> some

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
also worth it because it lets that some

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.900 
also worth it because it lets that some
energy<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.130> know<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.430> have<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:40.790> much

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
energy and you know we have so much

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.640 
energy and you know we have so much
extra<00:02:41.090> energy<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.960> burn<00:02:42.110> some<00:02:42.440> house

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
extra energy we have to burn some house

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.010 
extra energy we have to burn some house
so<00:02:42.860> why<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:43.160> do<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.520> way<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.630> know<00:02:44.780> cuz

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
so why not do it this way you know cuz

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.390 
so why not do it this way you know cuz
you<00:02:45.140> weren't<00:02:45.350> tired<00:02:45.560> enough<00:02:45.920> from<00:02:46.040> everything

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you weren't tired enough from everything

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
else you have to do but why not it's

be<00:03:11.750> good<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.320> want<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.280> cabbage<00:03:13.730> juice<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.660> be

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
be good you want the cabbage juice to be

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.199 
be good you want the cabbage juice to be
the<00:03:15.290> M<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.890> most<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.489> liquid<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:17.060> the

the M the most of the liquid of the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.390 
the M the most of the liquid of the
sauerkraut<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.900> not<00:03:18.019> water<00:03:18.230> um<00:03:18.560> I've

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
sauerkraut and not water um I've

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.310 
sauerkraut and not water um I've
actually<00:03:19.459> made<00:03:20.180> sauerkraut<00:03:20.750> both<00:03:21.110> without

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
actually made sauerkraut both without

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.300 
actually made sauerkraut both without
housing<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.190> with<00:03:22.459> handing<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.470> when

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
housing it and with handing it and when

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.570 
housing it and with handing it and when
you<00:03:25.430> pound<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.810> actually<00:03:27.280> explodes<00:03:28.280> less

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
you pound it it actually explodes less

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.340 
you pound it it actually explodes less
quickly<00:03:28.880> whereas<00:03:29.330> when<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.600> don't<00:03:29.810> pound<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
quickly whereas when you don't pound it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.580 
quickly whereas when you don't pound it
it<00:03:30.500> gets<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.519> those<00:03:31.670> spoil<00:03:32.000> faster<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:33.560> I

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it gets on those spoil faster see I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.530 
it gets on those spoil faster see I
finished<00:03:33.920> pounding<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.880> squeezing<00:03:35.450> it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
finished pounding it and squeezing it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.150 
finished pounding it and squeezing it
and<00:03:35.720> see<00:03:36.230> how<00:03:36.350> much<00:03:36.380> liquid<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.830> here<00:03:36.980> at<00:03:37.070> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
and see how much liquid is here at the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.190 
and see how much liquid is here at the
bottom<00:03:37.459> that's<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.390> liquid<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> want<00:03:39.080> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
bottom that's a liquid that you want to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.800 
bottom that's a liquid that you want to
have<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.370> at<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:40.820> point<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.330> actually<00:03:41.660> want

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
have and at this point you actually want

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.840 
have and at this point you actually want
to<00:03:41.870> be<00:03:41.989> tasting<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:44.590> well<00:03:45.590> none<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.340> more<00:03:46.370> salt

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
to be tasting it well none is more salt

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.979 
to be tasting it well none is more salt
the<00:03:47.090> way<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.239> know<00:03:47.420> how<00:03:47.570> if<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:47.750> needs<00:03:47.900> more

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
the way you know how if it needs more

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.530 
the way you know how if it needs more
salt<00:03:48.140> or<00:03:48.530> not<00:03:48.680> if<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.640> want<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.970> be<00:03:50.060> salty

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
salt or not if you want it to be salty

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.120 
salt or not if you want it to be salty
but<00:03:50.720> not<00:03:50.750> too<00:03:51.110> salty<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.739> makes<00:03:51.920> you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
but not too salty that it makes you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.220 
but not too salty that it makes you
gross<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.180> because<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.720> want<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.019> have

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
gross that because do you want to have

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.590 
gross that because do you want to have
salt<00:03:54.560> in<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.920> stop<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.160> bad<00:03:55.940> bacteria<00:03:56.180> from

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
salt in it to stop the bad bacteria from

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.720 
salt in it to stop the bad bacteria from
growing<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.860> have<00:03:57.950> too<00:03:58.190> much<00:03:58.310> salt<00:03:58.580> in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
growing but if you have too much salt in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.130 
growing but if you have too much salt in
it<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.090> good<00:03:59.239> bacteria<00:03:59.360> can't<00:03:59.989> grow

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
it and the good bacteria can't grow

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.110 
it and the good bacteria can't grow
either<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:01.010> want<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.280> add<00:04:01.370> enough<00:04:01.610> salt<00:04:01.640> so

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
either so you want to add enough salt so

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120 
either so you want to add enough salt so
it<00:04:02.239> tastes<00:04:02.450> kind<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.690> like<00:04:02.750> pickles<00:04:03.260> but<00:04:03.920> not

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
it tastes kind of like pickles but not

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.630 
it tastes kind of like pickles but not
way<00:04:04.700> too<00:04:04.760> salty<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.690> unpalatable<00:04:06.650> so

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
way too salty that it's unpalatable so

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.670 
way too salty that it's unpalatable so
on<00:04:07.940> there's<00:04:08.540> exact<00:04:08.930> measurements<00:04:09.500> for<00:04:09.620> how

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
on there's exact measurements for how

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.470 
on there's exact measurements for how
much<00:04:09.860> salt<00:04:10.130> you<00:04:10.220> could<00:04:10.459> add<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.269> usually

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
much salt you could add but I usually

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.810 
much salt you could add but I usually
just<00:04:11.660> do<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.170> take<00:04:12.380> now<00:04:12.769> then<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.459> finished

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
just do this to take now then I finished

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.360 
just do this to take now then I finished
adding<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.180> salt<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:15.530> tasted<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.220> make

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
adding the salt and I tasted it to make

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.280 
adding the salt and I tasted it to make
sure<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.789> right<00:04:16.910> saltiness

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
sure it's the right saltiness

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.750 
sure it's the right saltiness
you<00:04:18.410> could<00:04:18.560> add<00:04:18.680> other<00:04:18.830> spices<00:04:19.040> if<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.580> want

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
you could add other spices if you want

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.790 
you could add other spices if you want
the<00:04:20.300> traditional<00:04:20.810> European<00:04:20.930> ways<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.710> add

caraway seeds and mustard or some people

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.920 
caraway seeds and mustard or some people
add<00:04:25.070> Bailey's<00:04:25.490> if<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:26.330> want<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.570> make<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.810> more

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
add Bailey's if you want to make it more

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.200 
add Bailey's if you want to make it more
asian-inspired<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:28.010> could<00:04:28.190> add<00:04:28.340> some<00:04:28.610> ginger

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
asian-inspired you could add some ginger

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.450 
asian-inspired you could add some ginger

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.130 
and garlic and scallions and hot peppers
but<00:04:32.090> I'm<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.450> choosing<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.840> leave<00:04:33.050> this

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
but I'm just choosing to leave this

plane for next now we have to pack
everything<00:04:35.000> into<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.420> container<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.020> use<00:04:36.170> a

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
everything into a container I use a

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.440 
everything into a container I use a
mason<00:04:36.650> jar<00:04:36.680> I'm<00:04:37.430> aware<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.120> there's<00:04:38.300> some

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
mason jar I'm aware that there's some

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.870 
mason jar I'm aware that there's some
controversy<00:04:38.780> in<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.590> real<00:04:39.860> food<00:04:40.100> world<00:04:40.400> about

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
controversy in the real food world about

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.910 
controversy in the real food world about
using<00:04:41.300> mason<00:04:41.630> jars<00:04:41.810> for<00:04:41.990> ferments<00:04:42.440> but<00:04:42.680> I

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
using mason jars for ferments but I

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.730 
using mason jars for ferments but I
don't<00:04:43.460> really<00:04:43.580> care<00:04:43.700> um<00:04:44.210> they<00:04:44.990> say<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.500> using

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
don't really care um they say that using

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.540 
don't really care um they say that using
mason<00:04:46.250> jars<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:47.300> not<00:04:47.840> really<00:04:48.200> good<00:04:48.410> because<00:04:48.710> it

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
mason jars is not really good because it

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.640 
mason jars is not really good because it
can<00:04:49.700> let<00:04:49.940> oxygen<00:04:50.630> into<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.900> ferment<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
can let oxygen into the ferment and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.290 
can let oxygen into the ferment and
therefore<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.190> get<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.670> aerobic

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
therefore you get in aerobic

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.970 
therefore you get in aerobic
fermentation<00:04:54.230> except<00:04:54.560> instead<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.830> an

fermentation except instead of an

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.890 
fermentation except instead of an
anaerobic<00:04:55.310> fermentation<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:56.420> all<00:04:56.540> sorts<00:04:56.840> of

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
anaerobic fermentation and all sorts of

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.210 
anaerobic fermentation and all sorts of
things<00:04:57.140> like<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:57.920> know<00:04:58.070> what

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
things like that but you know what

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.340 
things like that but you know what
people<00:04:59.000> have<00:04:59.150> been<00:04:59.270> using<00:04:59.390> sauerkraut<00:04:59.960> for<00:05:00.140> so

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
people have been using sauerkraut for so

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.200 
people have been using sauerkraut for so
many<00:05:00.590> thousands<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.310> years<00:05:01.520> then<00:05:01.790> they<00:05:01.910> never

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
many thousands of years then they never

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.630 
many thousands of years then they never
use<00:05:02.480> a<00:05:02.510> special<00:05:03.020> pickle<00:05:03.350> jar<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.920> prevent

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
use a special pickle jar that prevent

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.580 
use a special pickle jar that prevent
that<00:05:04.760> check<00:05:04.970> out<00:05:05.000> all<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.330> oxygen<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:05.960> I'll

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
that check out all the oxygen so I'll

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.110 
that check out all the oxygen so I'll
just<00:05:06.830> keep<00:05:07.040> on<00:05:07.130> doing<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.460> way<00:05:07.610> people<00:05:08.060> always

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
just keep on doing the way people always

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.240 
just keep on doing the way people always
did<00:05:08.450> it<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.720> just<00:05:08.930> pack<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.170> in<00:05:09.380> my<00:05:09.500> jar<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:09.980> no

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
did it and just pack it in my jar and no

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.950 
did it and just pack it in my jar and no
mine<00:05:10.520> has<00:05:10.670> not<00:05:10.850> developed<00:05:11.150> any<00:05:11.480> mold<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:11.900> I'm

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
mine has not developed any mold and I'm

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.260 
mine has not developed any mold and I'm
not<00:05:12.140> worried<00:05:12.410> about<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:13.730> just<00:05:14.030> pack<00:05:14.240> it

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
not worried about that so just pack it

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.740 
not worried about that so just pack it
into<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.720> jar<00:05:15.790> yes<00:05:16.790> it<00:05:17.000> makes<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.300> mess<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.630> do

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
into the jar yes it makes a mess to do

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.120 
into the jar yes it makes a mess to do
that<00:05:17.900> if<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.110> have<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.290> big<00:05:18.470> funnel<00:05:18.740> that'll

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
that if you have a big funnel that'll

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.330 
that if you have a big funnel that'll
help<00:05:19.250> also<00:05:22.900> clean<00:05:23.900> up<00:05:24.020> afterwards<00:05:24.530> no<00:05:25.100> point

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
help also clean up afterwards no point

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.740 
help also clean up afterwards no point
doing<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.640> now<00:05:25.760> because<00:05:26.210> it'll<00:05:26.360> just<00:05:26.420> make<00:05:26.720> a

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
doing it now because it'll just make a

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.080 
doing it now because it'll just make a
bigger<00:05:26.990> mess

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
bigger mess

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.440 
bigger mess
pack<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.120> in<00:05:29.480> push<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.440> down<00:05:31.090> if<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.150> hit<00:05:32.420> a
