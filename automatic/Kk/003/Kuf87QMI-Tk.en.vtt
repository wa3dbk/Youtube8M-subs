yeah that does take some heart but it
also<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:16.890> way<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.190> out<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> fight<00:02:18.850> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
also a way to get out of the fight is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.130 
also a way to get out of the fight is
they<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:21.370> caught<00:02:21.790> into<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.269> much<00:02:22.450> fear<00:02:22.870> they

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
they get caught into so much fear they

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.360 
they get caught into so much fear they
look<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> way<00:02:23.830> out<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:26.019> think<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.130> just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
look for a way out and I think he just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.750 
look for a way out and I think he just
found<00:02:27.580> his<00:02:27.880> way<00:02:28.090> out<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:29.130> don't<00:02:30.130> think<00:02:30.459> he<00:02:30.610> was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
found his way out I don't think he was

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
found his way out I don't think he was
in<00:02:30.910> any<00:02:31.090> shape<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.830> go<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.370> distance<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:34.090> try<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
in any shape to go to distance or try to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.000 
in any shape to go to distance or try to
follow<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.230> gameplan<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.160> don't<00:02:37.150> believe<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:38.010> he

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
follow a gameplan I don't believe in he

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.759 
follow a gameplan I don't believe in he
might<00:02:39.250> say<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.209> my<00:02:40.269> intentions<00:02:41.049> but

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769
