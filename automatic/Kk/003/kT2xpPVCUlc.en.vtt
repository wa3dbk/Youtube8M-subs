Front's of these should be caulked I
like<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.560> one-piece<00:04:25.070> design<00:04:26.110> instead<00:04:27.110> of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
like this one-piece design instead of

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.060 
like this one-piece design instead of
like<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.390> because<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.570> they<00:04:29.750> don't<00:04:29.960> meet<00:04:30.200> so

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
like that because it they don't meet so
