going to be in zombies and also maybe
even<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.850> hammer<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.960> know<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.439> may<00:02:00.710> sound<00:02:00.740> a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
even the hammer I know that may sound a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.230 
even the hammer I know that may sound a
little<00:02:01.100> bit<00:02:01.310> weird<00:02:01.490> but<00:02:01.700> you're<00:02:01.850> going<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.030> see

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
little bit weird but you're going to see

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.880 
little bit weird but you're going to see
you<00:02:02.420> press<00:02:02.689> may<00:02:02.869> have<00:02:02.990> already<00:02:03.229> seen<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
you press may have already seen on the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.170 
you press may have already seen on the
chest<00:02:04.130> he's<00:02:04.310> going<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.490> grab<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.820> hammer<00:02:05.000> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
chest he's going to grab the hammer and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.969 
chest he's going to grab the hammer and
he's<00:02:05.299> going<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> upgrade<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.960> weapon<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.500> think

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
he's going to upgrade the weapon I think

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.529 
he's going to upgrade the weapon I think
upgrading<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> weapons<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.509> a

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
upgrading the weapons is going to be a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.820 
upgrading the weapons is going to be a
really<00:02:08.780> big<00:02:08.929> key<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.289> always<00:02:09.500> been<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> really

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
really big key it's always been a really

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.010 
really big key it's always been a really
big<00:02:10.039> key<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:10.580> really<00:02:10.729> hard<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.090> say<00:02:11.270> that

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
big key so it's really hard to say that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.050 
big key so it's really hard to say that
you<00:02:12.560> know<00:02:12.650> regular<00:02:12.860> weapons<00:02:13.310> are<00:02:13.430> good<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.940> an

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
you know regular weapons are good to an

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.880 
you know regular weapons are good to an
extent<00:02:14.420> but<00:02:14.570> when<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.870> reach<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.290> level<00:02:15.650> 30

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
extent but when you reach like level 30

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.980 
extent but when you reach like level 30
or<00:02:16.100> something<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.550> love<00:02:16.730> 20<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.600> really<00:02:17.870> do
