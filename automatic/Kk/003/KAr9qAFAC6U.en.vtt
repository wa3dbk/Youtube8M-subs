stealth cam 1430 ir it's a digital trail
camera<00:00:15.839> produced<00:00:16.650> by<00:00:16.860> stealth<00:00:17.220> cam<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:18.330> look

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
camera produced by stealth cam to look

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.769 
camera produced by stealth cam to look
its<00:00:18.720> size<00:00:19.560> dimension<00:00:20.250> wise<00:00:20.430> pretty<00:00:21.330> similar

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
its size dimension wise pretty similar

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
its size dimension wise pretty similar
to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> lot<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> digital<00:00:22.949> trail<00:00:23.220> cameras

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to a lot of the digital trail cameras

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.939 
to a lot of the digital trail cameras
maybe<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.539> bit<00:00:24.960> smaller<00:00:25.289> than<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:25.800> but

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
maybe a little bit smaller than some but

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
maybe a little bit smaller than some but
i<00:00:26.010> think<00:00:26.250> by<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> average<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.599> look<00:00:27.840> at

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
i think by the average as we look at

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
i think by the average as we look at
overall<00:00:28.769> width<00:00:29.130> about<00:00:29.640> seven<00:00:30.119> inches<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
overall width about seven inches and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.060 
overall width about seven inches and
that<00:00:30.750> goes<00:00:30.929> clear<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> paddle<00:00:31.980> out

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that goes clear out to the paddle out

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.369 
that goes clear out to the paddle out
connection<00:00:32.580> you're<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> side<00:00:33.150> we<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.230> at

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
connection you're on the side we look at

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.229 
connection you're on the side we look at
depth<00:00:34.650> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.949> distance<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.519> trail<00:00:35.790> camera

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
depth of the distance this trail camera

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060

would<00:00:36.420> stand<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.470> tree<00:00:37.799> or<00:00:37.949> other

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
would stand out from the tree or other

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.299 
would stand out from the tree or other
mounting<00:00:38.489> surfaces<00:00:39.620> looks<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.830> three

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

digital trail camera maybe just a little
bit<00:00:46.140> smaller<00:00:46.530> than<00:00:46.650> some<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:48.030> outer<00:00:48.180> material

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

allowing us to see what's out there on

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.910 
allowing us to see what's out there on
the<00:03:51.640> trail<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.080> video<00:03:53.320> mode<00:03:53.650> once

again<00:03:54.190> we're<00:03:54.340> looking<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.790> some<00:03:54.940> unique

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
again we're looking for some unique

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.670 
again we're looking for some unique
footage<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.780> we<00:03:55.870> wouldn't<00:03:56.110> be<00:03:56.200> able<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.440> see

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
footage that we wouldn't be able to see

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.230 
footage that we wouldn't be able to see
if<00:03:56.860> we<00:03:57.010> were<00:03:57.040> out<00:03:57.250> there<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.580> person<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.150> can

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
if we were out there in person it can

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.300 
if we were out there in person it can
only<00:03:58.330> be<00:03:58.570> there<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.440> only<00:03:59.560> captured<00:04:00.100> by<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.160 
models it does have the 12-volt
connection<00:04:05.860> on<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.010> bottom<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.750> gives<00:04:08.020> us

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
connection on the bottom that gives us

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.260 
connection on the bottom that gives us
the<00:04:08.320> capability<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.980> hook<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.640> 12-volt

the capability to hook this to a 12-volt

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.320 
the capability to hook this to a 12-volt
battery<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:11.080> one<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.920> solar<00:04:12.580> 12<00:04:13.120> volt

battery or one of the solar 12 volt
rechargeable<00:04:13.480> systems<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:14.860> we<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.100> leave<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
rechargeable systems so we can leave the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.670 
rechargeable systems so we can leave the
system<00:04:15.550> out<00:04:15.880> there<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.690> latch<00:04:16.930> stealth<00:04:17.380> camp

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
system out there the latch stealth camp

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.319 
system out there the latch stealth camp
it's<00:04:17.950> on<00:04:18.630> very<00:04:19.630> durable

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
it's on very durable

it's on very durable
this<00:04:20.689> is<00:04:20.840> again<00:04:21.079> one<00:04:21.259> of<00:04:21.289> those<00:04:21.439> cameras<00:04:21.889> you

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
this is again one of those cameras you

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.469 
this is again one of those cameras you
can<00:04:22.009> leave<00:04:22.280> out<00:04:22.400> there<00:04:22.639> for<00:04:22.849> some<00:04:23.030> time<00:04:23.240> you've

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
can leave out there for some time you've

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.809 
can leave out there for some time you've
got<00:04:23.629> that<00:04:23.780> 12<00:04:24.110> volt<00:04:24.289> connection<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.889> larger<00:04:25.639> SD

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
got that 12 volt connection a larger SD

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.070 
got that 12 volt connection a larger SD
card<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:27.259> products<00:04:27.710> built<00:04:28.280> very<00:04:28.610> well<00:04:29.080> and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
card the products built very well and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.990 
card the products built very well and
like<00:04:30.259> all<00:04:30.500> stealth<00:04:30.800> cam<00:04:31.099> products<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.729> think<00:04:31.939> a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
like all stealth cam products I think a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.179 
like all stealth cam products I think a
pretty<00:04:32.210> good<00:04:32.360> value<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.080> money<00:04:33.110> keep<00:04:34.039> in

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
pretty good value for the money keep in

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.070 
pretty good value for the money keep in
mind<00:04:34.219> that<00:04:34.490> for<00:04:34.819> megapixel<00:04:35.120> camera<00:04:35.840> gives<00:04:35.990> you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
mind that for megapixel camera gives you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.480 
mind that for megapixel camera gives you
some<00:04:36.229> flexibility<00:04:36.860> some<00:04:37.159> of<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.340> other

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
some flexibility some of the other

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.390 
some flexibility some of the other
cameras<00:04:37.939> don't<00:04:38.319> personally<00:04:39.319> most<00:04:40.189> of<00:04:40.340> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
cameras don't personally most of the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.390 
cameras don't personally most of the
cameras<00:04:40.909> that<00:04:41.150> we<00:04:41.270> run<00:04:41.449> all<00:04:41.659> the<00:04:41.780> time<00:04:42.159> this<00:04:43.159> is

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
cameras that we run all the time this is

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.369 
cameras that we run all the time this is
probably<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.879> little<00:04:44.150> higher<00:04:44.360> resolution<00:04:45.199> than

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
probably a little higher resolution than

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.140 
probably a little higher resolution than
we<00:04:45.620> used<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.919> use<00:04:46.189> and<00:04:46.430> we<00:04:46.580> go<00:04:46.759> with<00:04:46.939> a<00:04:46.969> little

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
we used to use and we go with a little

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.420 
we used to use and we go with a little
simpler<00:04:47.689> product<00:04:48.169> but<00:04:48.710> again<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:49.069> depends<00:04:49.340> on

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
simpler product but again it depends on

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.950 
simpler product but again it depends on
what<00:04:49.610> you're<00:04:49.819> after<00:04:49.969> want<00:04:50.569> to<00:04:50.629> keep<00:04:50.780> those

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
what you're after want to keep those

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.350 
what you're after want to keep those
photos<00:04:51.409> higher<00:04:52.009> resolution<00:04:52.699> is<00:04:52.789> important<00:04:53.270> if

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
photos higher resolution is important if

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.700 
photos higher resolution is important if
you<00:04:53.479> just<00:04:53.690> want<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.900> see<00:04:54.080> what's<00:04:54.259> running<00:04:54.500> by

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
you just want to see what's running by

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.939 
you just want to see what's running by
you<00:04:54.770> probably<00:04:55.250> don't<00:04:55.460> need<00:04:55.580> quite<00:04:55.879> that<00:04:55.909> much

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
you probably don't need quite that much

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.159 
you probably don't need quite that much
this<00:04:57.949> particular<00:04:58.280> product<00:04:59.180> gives<00:04:59.659> you<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.840> lot

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
this particular product gives you a lot

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.409 
this particular product gives you a lot
of<00:05:00.229> video<00:05:00.680> features<00:05:01.159> for<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> money<00:05:01.669> it's

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
of video features for the money it's

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.540 
of video features for the money it's
probably<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.900> little<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.169> complex<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.099> set<00:05:04.340> up

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
probably a little more complex to set up

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.149 
probably a little more complex to set up
then<00:05:05.180> some<00:05:05.629> of<00:05:05.659> the<00:05:05.840> simpler<00:05:06.259> trail<00:05:06.620> cameras

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
then some of the simpler trail cameras

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.939 
then some of the simpler trail cameras
but<00:05:07.879> again<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> lot<00:05:08.539> of<00:05:08.599> capabilities<00:05:09.440> there<00:05:09.680> if

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
but again a lot of capabilities there if

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.249 
but again a lot of capabilities there if
you<00:05:10.789> have<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.060> time<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.389> learn<00:05:11.509> how<00:05:11.569> to<00:05:11.779> use<00:05:11.870> it

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
you have the time to learn how to use it

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.480

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
and you're any any at all video savvy

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.330 
and you're any any at all video savvy
it's<00:05:17.180> certainly<00:05:17.629> doable<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:18.379> don't<00:05:18.979> claim<00:05:19.279> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
it's certainly doable I don't claim to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.279 
it's certainly doable I don't claim to
be<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.610> pro<00:05:20.029> by<00:05:20.060> any<00:05:20.449> stretch<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.139> it's

be a pro by any stretch and it's

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.749 
be a pro by any stretch and it's
something<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.740> I'm<00:05:21.830> able<00:05:22.009> to<00:05:22.159> figure<00:05:22.460> out

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
something that I'm able to figure out

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.469 
something that I'm able to figure out
just<00:05:23.060> by<00:05:23.180> going<00:05:23.389> through<00:05:23.509> the<00:05:23.689> directions<00:05:25.479> you
