of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> time<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
of the time this is because of all the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.830 
of the time this is because of all the
bonuses<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.240> while<00:01:42.450> playing<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.810> the

doing<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> rank<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.790> faster<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.329> improve

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
doing so to rank up faster and improve

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
doing so to rank up faster and improve
your<00:01:48.720> overall<00:01:48.869> win-loss<00:01:49.590> ratio<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
your overall win-loss ratio not that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.280 
your overall win-loss ratio not that
