00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
stream than the gun sights then when you

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.810 
stream than the gun sights then when you

did<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> crosshairs<00:02:51.870> change<00:02:52.320> shape

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
did you see the crosshairs change shape

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.710 
did you see the crosshairs change shape
when<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> measurement<00:02:53.250> was<00:02:53.430> made<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:54.600> will

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
when the measurement was made we will

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.280 
when the measurement was made we will
discuss<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.590> few<00:02:55.860> minutes<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> far<00:02:57.750> we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
discuss that in a few minutes so far we

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.720 
discuss that in a few minutes so far we
have<00:02:58.380> been<00:02:58.530> measuring<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> prism

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
have been measuring to a prism

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.850 
have been measuring to a prism
let's<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.690> think<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:01.080> reflect<00:03:01.620> Ellis

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
let's now think about reflect Ellis

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.980 
let's now think about reflect Ellis
survey<00:03:02.250> maybe<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:03.090> need<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.270> measure<00:03:03.540> points

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
survey maybe we need to measure points

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.600 
survey maybe we need to measure points
which<00:03:04.140> cannot<00:03:04.440> physically<00:03:05.010> be<00:03:05.130> reached<00:03:05.340> with

which cannot physically be reached with

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.090 
which cannot physically be reached with
the<00:03:05.640> prism<00:03:06.090> Pole<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:07.320> case<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.800> want<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the prism Pole in this case we want to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.620 
the prism Pole in this case we want to
measure<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.550> corner<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> window<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
measure to the corner of the window in

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.140 
measure to the corner of the window in
the<00:03:09.660> building<00:03:09.950> we<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.070> use<00:03:11.250> tap<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:11.670> turn<00:03:11.850> to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
the building we can use tap and turn to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150 
the building we can use tap and turn to
move<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.450> toe<00:03:12.630> station<00:03:13.260> close<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.890> point

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
move the toe station close to the point

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.520 
move the toe station close to the point
we<00:03:14.250> want<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.459> measure<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:15.930> zoom<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.320> to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
we want to measure we then zoom in to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.229 
we want to measure we then zoom in to
get<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> closer<00:03:16.950> look<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.000> should<00:03:18.120> also

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
get a closer look and we should also

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.030 
get a closer look and we should also
change<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.780> color<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.260> crosshairs<00:03:19.739> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
change the color of the crosshairs to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.910 
change the color of the crosshairs to
make<00:03:20.190> them<00:03:20.310> easier<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.730> see<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.709> now<00:03:22.709> let's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
make them easier to see and now let's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.800 
make them easier to see and now let's
pause<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.340> video<00:03:23.580> here<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:24.090> discuss<00:03:24.480> about

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
pause the video here to discuss about

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470 
pause the video here to discuss about
the<00:03:24.989> parallax<00:03:25.730> let's<00:03:26.730> look<00:03:26.970> again<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.269> the

are<00:03:38.400> different<00:03:38.790> there<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> parallax

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
are different there is a parallax

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
are different there is a parallax
between<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> two<00:03:40.800> which<00:03:41.340> needs<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.700> be

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
between the two which needs to be

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.479

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
corrected if you look at the crosshairs

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.420 
corrected if you look at the crosshairs
now<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.300> will<00:03:45.420> see<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.350> an<00:03:46.500> open<00:03:46.830> circle

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
now you will see it is an open circle

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.910 
now you will see it is an open circle
this<00:03:48.180> means<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.690> parallax<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.380> currently<00:03:49.739> not

this means the parallax is currently not

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.880 
this means the parallax is currently not
corrected<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:51.510> we<00:03:51.840> measure<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.110> distance<00:03:52.380> then

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
corrected if we measure a distance then

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.590 
corrected if we measure a distance then
the<00:03:53.040> instrument<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.670> correct<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> parallax

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
the instrument can correct the parallax

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.960
