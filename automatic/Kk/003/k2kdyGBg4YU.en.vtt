00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
see if I can get up there was the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.480 
see if I can get up there was the
on-ramp<00:02:19.750> probably<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.840> way<00:02:21.310> doesn't<00:02:22.310> look

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
on-ramp probably this way doesn't look

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.570 
on-ramp probably this way doesn't look
good<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.320> think<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.620> guy<00:02:24.770> faithfully

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
good so I think this guy faithfully

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.510 
good so I think this guy faithfully
recreated<00:02:26.120> an<00:02:26.300> area<00:02:26.600> near<00:02:26.810> his<00:02:26.960> home<00:02:27.200> oh<00:02:27.520> okay

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
recreated an area near his home oh okay

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.060 
recreated an area near his home oh okay
I<00:02:29.420> think<00:02:29.630> that's<00:02:29.900> what<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.170> said<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.380> really

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
I think that's what it said and really

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.610 
I think that's what it said and really
pay<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> lot<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.580> attention<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> think<00:02:33.230> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
pay a lot of attention so I think I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.650 
pay a lot of attention so I think I
don't<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.310> his<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:35.060> are<00:02:35.270> these<00:02:35.390> streets

so I want to see the crash PhysX right I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.980 
so I want to see the crash PhysX right I
guess<00:04:25.120> that's<00:04:25.150> what<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.510> game<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.690> about<00:04:25.810> I

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.170 
guess that's what this game is about I
guess<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.590> other<00:04:26.740> Island<00:04:26.890> damn<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.430> they<00:04:28.030> can

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
guess that other Island damn it they can

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.120 
guess that other Island damn it they can
go<00:04:28.270> in<00:04:28.360> here<00:04:28.600> mmm<00:04:29.470> no<00:04:30.540> no<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:31.630> can't<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.140> don't
