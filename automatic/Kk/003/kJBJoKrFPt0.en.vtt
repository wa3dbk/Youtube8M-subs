00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.689
 I even think it is too many people to go to the sauna now and then 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.989
 I have to go there by car and you have to pay quite a bit for it 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.699
 now you can order more attended shopping channels each for home 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.839
 With that you would also waste about 500 calories in half an hour again 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.480
 sounds pretty good but I think it is frankly looking ahead is one 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.380
 movie 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.480
 but we are going to try what I am not talking about for the consumer association 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.609
 the mail settings guys have a very good cheer 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.549
 getsie makes itself very unique in tunisia if with decency standards 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.820
 got the best impression in treatment we are going to sit and their project in the 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.799
 poll and finally it is better a loved one not really not anymore and not 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.200
 the police have been seized, according to the cidi 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.960
 Simon's idea 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 Imagine you are steadily getting an injection this foundation puts it smooth 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.760
 god god is nothing they can't place and i don't like black 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.439
 justice dropped his voice 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.250
 are hard to see 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.810
 this shows that together 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 Amsterdam puts view that advice getting used to that regard 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.800
 nijkerk used at sk gooik is only one conditional on demand 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.250
 to go 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.610
 no I am dressed and actress queen that I am thirty minutes 5 man you come 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 soon 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 I wonder if that's it alone 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.399
 because it takes a while before someone 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.399
 it's a little exciting moment 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.850
 the big question is how is that possible? 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.080
 9 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.680
 3 analysts I deal with suspect we have shown life 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.329
 the 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.209
 apple 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.070
 mh 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.070
 you just can't go anywhere else 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.549
 some showers 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.480
 only immigrants 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 but what i see you so 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:36.509
 after more than ten minutes I am now in a budget and more accountable 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.749
 It may be nice that it is a condition by 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.189
 that the first quarter of this year 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.309
 I am I am not relaxed I am not living in the Netherlands you just need anp 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.469
 just a few thousand people 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.469
 but we go 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.870
 it is even that way 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.019
 what do you think 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.529
 hahahahaha 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.450
 I'll just explain what not everyone knows 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.089
 the investment is 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.579
 inspire 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.579
 with the women 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.049
 And as you can see I sometimes know what it is 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.249
 but it is not nearly as bad as an ordinary sauna bank card 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.560
 why not all ideas can easily take half an hour or even longer 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.229
 The phenomenon 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.320
 I think there is still what I can do 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.649
 and he understands 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.939
 I can now retire afterwards 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.399
 or in that you can with the program 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.869
 but I have to wait a while that it had half a percent 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.279
 yes and that suspicion 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.579
 You must remember that it just doesn't really stand up 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.929
 The military intelligence service does not really include MIVD either 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:07.599
 you believe it me 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.470
 and the temperature does not nag at the road 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.219
 has had the longest time 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.150
 and then via 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.439
 you will find that vvd 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.430
 the women ride 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.050
 and a nice party to go from home to home 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.129
 nice to leave remarkable 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.019
