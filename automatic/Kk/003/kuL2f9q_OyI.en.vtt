00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.429
 hello dear friend in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.690
 America Ruslan 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.710
 and in this video I will show you the lessons 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.340
 the way you 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.820
 do a quick file search on your own 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.629
 computer that is 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:12.749
 earlier 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.980
 via the Internet and on your computer 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 I use very often 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.050
 special program which 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.609
 allows you to find 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.869
 necessary not being stored on 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.569
 computer fast 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.439
 because 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.339
 if i use 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.460
 standard search engine which 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.350
 us so much 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.630
 default 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.980
 the results are very 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.890
 look long since the program is very 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 running slowly and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.890
 I, as they say, does poorly with its 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.170
 functions and therefore the process 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.450
 search file needed 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.240
 drags on for a long time 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.730
 that's why i use 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.030
 program from Yandex 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.200
 there is such a special 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.630
 program with which you can 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.360
 find files 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 it is on your computer that is 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.730
 Yandex search engine you know 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.860
 using it given and looking for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.060
 files on the Internet 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.850
 there is also a search engine of the Russian Federation 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.729
 which are installed 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.560
 computer and using it 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 we can not 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.840
 find files 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 which we have on the computer 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.100
 let's learn more now 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 so I have internet here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 mosque 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 this connection is broken 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440
