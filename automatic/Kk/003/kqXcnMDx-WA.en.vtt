00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.180
 very good friends and friends I am aldo 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 barelli and I welcome you to a 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.930
 new video this time I'm going to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 show how to install and download 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 minecraft forge for brand 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.660
 1.7 point 10 is minecraft forge for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.550
 a few points 7.10 is coming and with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 it's going to get new motorbikes so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's go fully into the subject and how 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 is right now because we are here in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 my computer's desktop like 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 It is always full but ignore the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.589
 other files what matters to us is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 is installed but most of all we have 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.420
 to go to what is being the page 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 of discharge that will be in the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
 description as always in all 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 mods and videos that I have based on the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 description in download link so 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.850
 let's explain a little more to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.620
 detail how it works and what what 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 we have to do once they go to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 this page of this link that we have 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.899
 here you are going to see this little screen 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 where will all the files of 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.449
 discharge 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 we are going to see here that is in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.250
 mainquÃ© 16 41 72 and maybe when 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.660
 the video or go to this page is going to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.340
 be being modified so what 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.220
 we will find that we are the jorge 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.480
 interesting in this case minecraft 1.7 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.490
 point 10 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.770
 they will see two recommendations or rather 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.630
 said two types of files will be 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 the last file and the recommended 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.710
 we will always have to download the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.980
 recommended because it is the most stable and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 It is the best of all to avoid 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.180
 failures in our minecraft and that to avoid 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.420
 that what is being the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.000
 file or the the game so once 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 that we have the minecraft 1.7 point 10 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.050
 let's see all these things that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 they are here we are going to look 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.920
 that is the installer we are going 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.620
 to click I was going to start what they say or 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.300
 downloading so let's do what 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.760
 this little download is going to look like 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.740
 that saying the little screen of clive and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.530
 the two of us have to stay in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.940
 this page does not appear this we are going to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.380
 Sometimes this small 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.060
 failure so let's go back to race 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.399
 this page 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.630
 and once it is loaded it will appear 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.069
 this here please wait five 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.140
 seconds let's ignore all the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 content and we will wait for the five 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.819
 seconds like that is that we skip the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 advertising we're going to give you that and you have to 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.980
 start our download and here goes to 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.560
 appear appears that can damage this is 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 when this kind of warnings appear 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.130
 we have to ignore it because this is not 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.140
 no virus is nothing like that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.209
 simply that it is a file that is not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.340
 recognized by windows and but it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.080
 totally safe to download it I say 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.670
 since it's been from minecraft in order to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.130
 accounts the lords of minecraft 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.560
 authorize these programmers to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.030
 make your your files so let's 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 give it to download although I already have it 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.380
 downloaded and it appears here what being 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.720
 the force that we went to we can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.580
 click here directly but let's go 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 to move here to the file that I already have 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.840
 installed so we're going to give it 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 double click depending on the file that 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.670
 you have is the same function is going to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 work in the same way always and 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.239
 when is the recommended file because 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.370
 is what the programmers recommend 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.920
 of minecraft so we wait for 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.390
 is activated and this will appear 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040
 small screen so we 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.530
 We will be able to install client of the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.780
 server or extract we never go 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.640
 to extract simply let's install it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.620
 15 in the client now less than that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 you know how to install a handle 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.319
 servers since they already know that what 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.180
 they have to do but I'm going to 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.890
 explain what is being when 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.470
 we are users but private 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.420
 or that we have client installation 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.820
 we can find or choose 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.610
 directly here our point folder 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.440
 minecraft in roaming or if we have it in 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.390
 some other place we are going to go to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.520
 these three little dots to give this button 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.040
 and we will see the option of 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.260
 find our micro point folder 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.820
 like for example I have it here in 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.400
 roaming and I already have it installed so 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.220
 we simply give in to accept and go to 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.800
 install what is being the borge in 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.750
 our minecraft but before that 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.239
 they are going to install that they have to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.209
 make sure they do not have any other 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.330
 minecraft forge version I explain myself if 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.540
 you have minecraft forge 1.6 point 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.730
 41 points 7.2 in the same location in the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.990
 same minecraft point folder is not going 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.580
 to work 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.070
 so you are going to have to create 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.590
 another blank minecraft point folder 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.750
 to be able to install this because 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.880
 like the other forms so I thought 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.680
 prudent to give them that clarification so 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.690
 let's go here to the minecraft point folder 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.340
 after it is installed us 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.470
 let's check enter our 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.020
 minecraft point folder and we have to go 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.670
 to the versions folder or version like this 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.320
 that the normal folder will appear 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.720
 which is a blank folder and it's going to 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.070
 appear the folder of forge us 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 we will also see that here at 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.760
 principle maybe this appears 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.590
 mods folder basically we are not going to 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.210
 can be installing mods so what 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.250
 what we have to do once this one 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.070
 finish installing the forge process 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.560
 is to start our minecraft once 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.520
 started we closed the minecraft 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.220
 and it will appear 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.150
 automatically in the mods folder 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.180
 so once we have we 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.650
 we can go to the downloads of the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.990
 different ways crawling to the 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.600
 folder of mods as well as I have here the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.790
 of blog that is a pretty pretty mode 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.560
 not that it's very interesting but still 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.060
 is in development but good the case is 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.920
 that we are going to install mons 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.320
 just pulling the ones in the folder 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.450
 mods and saying author minecraft and 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.310
 so this is what the saying 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.400
 installation of minecraft because to 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.040
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 which is the version 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.380
 most recent so far so 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.390
