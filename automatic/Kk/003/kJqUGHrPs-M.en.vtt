the freaking best I think I just like
mist<00:00:45.109> on<00:00:45.230> one<00:00:45.350> out<00:00:45.469> here<00:00:45.829> we<00:00:45.890> go<00:00:46.420> pick<00:00:47.420> got

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
mist on one out here we go pick got

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.529 
mist on one out here we go pick got
destroyed<00:00:48.309> yeah<00:00:49.309> I'm<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:49.909> today<00:00:50.149> we<00:00:50.300> are<00:00:50.420> using

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
destroyed yeah I'm so today we are using

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:51.910 
destroyed yeah I'm so today we are using
like<00:00:50.749> a<00:00:50.780> silence<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.289> kind<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.559> weapon<00:00:51.800> I

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
like a silence a kind of weapon I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.779 
like a silence a kind of weapon I
figured<00:00:52.219> that<00:00:52.370> might<00:00:52.550> be<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.670> best

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
considering the fact that we're going

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.899 
considering the fact that we're going
around<00:00:54.409> trying<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.829> kill<00:00:55.010> people<00:00:55.159> and<00:00:55.519> get
