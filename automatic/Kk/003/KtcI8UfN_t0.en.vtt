00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:20.210
 we as professor of architecture of the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.190
 university center of great sao paulo 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.960
 we could not leave the memory of 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:30.170
 check on today where we ended up 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.080
 of losing the largest of the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.949
 Brazilian and world architecture 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.160
 a Brazilian named oscar neymar who 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.430
 by the way was the patron in the goal 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.909
 and for this homage to be made 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.860
 I pass the word to Professor Roberto 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:54.769
 Xavier who is the legitimate representative 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.909
 This time I'm going to talk about oscar. 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.339
 of May 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:03.769
 at the same time is a simple and 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:06.320
 Complex complex because it deals with 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.110
 doubt of the most important architect who 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.220
 Brazilian society has seen birth and 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.200
 in simple because it appears throughout 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.759
 and any corner is in the mouth of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.829
 every student 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.070
 she is aware of any and all 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.159
 Brazilian citizens think your pet 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.509
 was first and foremost a privileged and 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.210
 above all, someone who 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.049
 provided a great privilege was 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.439
 to count on the extraordinary contribution 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.170
 richness that it gave to all of us 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.990
 through a series of works that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.329
 make up a broad spectrum in the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.789
 Brazilian territory and not only in 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.960
 more than this in the five 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.759
 continents 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.159
 oscar neymar was someone who made himself 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.490
 present in both North Africa 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.200
 while in France and in turkey 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.899
 while in Italy while in spain and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.690
 not to mention Brazil sao paulo and river 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.060
 January in particular mines general 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.150
 combining with a unique work that was the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.350
 design of a space that is the author of the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.740
 luxury safe 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.980
 that people or in a very rich way 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.170
 What was the daughter of Brasilia did not 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.640
 today it is enough for a citizen to live 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 productively 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.860
 throughout his 80 years of age he 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.160
 animals had 80 years of production you 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.140
 begins in the 30's and did not stop strictly 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.020
 in the bed of his deathbed in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.940
 hospital in rio de janeiro 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.040
 are 105 years of life 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.260
 are 105 years that we contemplate 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.600
 shut down and I did not have 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.570
 hoped that all of us 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.690
 we regret that we would like a 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.080
 long life and activity 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.320
 that he was granted a 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.930
 day a kind of provocation plus it 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.340
 continue to provide us with a 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.030
 unusual beauty of meaning building 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.950
 find s 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 and that any city 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.710
 important in Brazil could count on 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.520
 its production as that ended 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.800
 exactly the day before yesterday and yesterday was invaded 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.610
 press for news about his 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.070
 death 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.850
 any and every homage he receives 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 is small in relation to the importance 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.100
 it lasts from the inheritance that left us 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.530
 someone who lives in the 8-1101 to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.740
 on the eve of his 105 years complaining about 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.800
 we actually up to about 20 projects one 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.100
 clipboard is something extraordinary 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.350
 and if any idea were to be epitaph 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.460
 in your grave I think it's the most 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.990
 significant would be died to the verses of 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.810
 105 years complaining about a high in the 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.010
 hospital to complete 20 projects that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 I was on your drawing board.
