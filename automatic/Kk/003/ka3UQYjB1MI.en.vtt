 mario castañeda de goku tell is mario 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 What struck you the most 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
 to make this movie good the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.280
 opportunity to return to interpret 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 something I could get dressed again 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 superhero is a character I know 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.950
 for many years almost 20 I'm going to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.289
 fight half 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.719
 and about 5 years ago the series ended 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.399
 the last episode however they have 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.200
 returned with these two movies and 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.049
 now in 2015 with the resolution of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.579
 pixel then it's very exciting not 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.189
 only for the fans I think also for 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.530
 all cast actors the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.939
 opportunity to reinterpret the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.460
 characters you in what way you 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.020
 you identify with your character not much 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.719
 because the truth is not seen saying to me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.130
 nothing comes out of the hands sings but good 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.280
 Love your children I think it's something that 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.599
 yes to 55 share it I understand it I think 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.979
 I'm not so bad, I'm trying to be 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.869
 when he is least he is never 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.240
 face for dances fans we can 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.350
 choose from this new movie many 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.360
 hits 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.040
 I think in the previous movie the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.369
 people were left wanting to see this 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.440
 little more more warrior create our 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.959
 character my character in this movie 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.429
 the resurrection of freezer is nothing more and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.770
 nothing less than the evil emperor 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.360
 tricio which is what you like most about 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.830
 this character the one I like the most about him 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.190
 It is that it is bad as pig meat 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.730
 of course or he never changes 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.790
 side as the jetta and choir or some 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.560
 others out there he is not not not bad from 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.769
