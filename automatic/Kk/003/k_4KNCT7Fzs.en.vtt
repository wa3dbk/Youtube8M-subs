these are stones Evie Evie needs a mega
evolution<00:05:16.570> mega<00:05:16.750> easy<00:05:18.810> it's<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:20.020> my

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
evolution mega easy it's to my

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.780 
evolution mega easy it's to my
understanding<00:05:20.170> that<00:05:20.740> this<00:05:21.010> mega<00:05:21.310> evolution

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
understanding that this mega evolution

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.570 
understanding that this mega evolution
occurs<00:05:22.180> with<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.450> stone<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:23.590> give<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.190> stone<00:05:24.430> to

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
occurs with a stone so give the stone to

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.700 
occurs with a stone so give the stone to
EV<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.240> let's<00:05:25.570> see<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:25.960> evolve<00:05:26.380> into

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
EV and let's see it evolve into

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.700 
EV and let's see it evolve into
something<00:05:26.890> really<00:05:27.760> awesome<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.570> mean<00:05:29.050> EV<00:05:29.620> has

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
something really awesome I mean EV has

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.040 
something really awesome I mean EV has
already<00:05:30.040> mastered<00:05:30.550> silver<00:05:31.330> forms<00:05:31.930> of

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
already mastered silver forms of

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.560 
already mastered silver forms of
evolution<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:33.190> why<00:05:33.310> not<00:05:33.550> make<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.880> evolution

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
evolution so why not make it evolution
