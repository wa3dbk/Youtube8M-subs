now<00:04:28.990> let's<00:04:29.289> see<00:04:29.530> what<00:04:29.740> malwarebytes<00:04:30.610> finds

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
now let's see what malwarebytes finds

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.309 
now let's see what malwarebytes finds
well<00:04:32.620> well<00:04:32.979> well<00:04:33.340> look<00:04:33.849> what<00:04:34.050> malwarebytes<00:04:35.050> is

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
well well well look what malwarebytes is

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.080 
well well well look what malwarebytes is
found<00:04:36.840> by<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.080> save<00:04:38.699> looks<00:04:39.699> like<00:04:39.849> that<00:04:40.000> was
