00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
my eye below the bottom part but you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820

nozzle like straight up it's kind of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
nozzle like straight up it's kind of
scary<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> try<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.159> can

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
scary but you can try and you can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.710 
scary but you can try and you can
control<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> pressure<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> kama<00:01:27.240> rinses

out<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> technique

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
out I don't really like that technique
right<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> works<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
right there but that's how it works and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
right there but that's how it works and
it<00:01:31.619> drips<00:01:31.829> down<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> paper<00:01:32.820> towel<00:01:33.090> and

it drips down you have a paper towel and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
it drips down you have a paper towel and
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.020> keep<00:01:34.200> doing<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.619> several<00:01:34.860> times<00:01:35.070> as

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you can keep doing it several times as
