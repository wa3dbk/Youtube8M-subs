box<00:01:08.520> wears<00:01:09.049> definitely<00:01:10.049> increased<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
box wears definitely increased the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.800 
box wears definitely increased the
accuracy<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:12.150> increased<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
accuracy it's also increased the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
accuracy it's also increased the
productivity<00:01:13.130> because<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.460> selector<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.840> no

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
productivity because the selector has no

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
productivity because the selector has no
time<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:17.369> talk<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> communicate

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
time to actually talk and communicate

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
time to actually talk and communicate
with<00:01:18.659> everybody<00:01:19.049> else<00:01:19.259> he's<00:01:19.530> communicating

with<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> system<00:01:20.850> itself<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> keeps<00:01:22.020> him

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
with the system itself so it keeps him

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.710 
with the system itself so it keeps him
more<00:01:22.380> focused<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.890> his<00:01:23.100> job<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> hand<00:01:23.759> instead

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
keep track of stuff Vox we were

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.930 
keep track of stuff Vox we were
eliminated<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.400> training

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
eliminated all that so that training

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
eliminated all that so that training
part<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.239> basically<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:25.989> shot<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:26.620> off

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
part of basically just shot right off

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.830 
part of basically just shot right off
and<00:02:27.310> they<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.879> directly<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.480> just

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
and they can go directly to just

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
and they can go directly to just
concentrating<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.590> what<00:02:30.159> what<00:02:30.489> location<00:02:31.030> they

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
concentrating on what what location they

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.979 
concentrating on what what location they
go<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:32.200> voice<00:02:32.620> box<00:02:33.129> where<00:02:33.459> system<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.180> a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
go to the voice box where system is a

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.199 
go to the voice box where system is a
self-training<00:02:35.829> mechanism<00:02:36.489> also<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.120> know

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
self-training mechanism also you know

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.660 
self-training mechanism also you know
once<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.659> tell<00:02:37.870> them<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.170> basics<00:02:38.650> Vox<00:02:39.430> ware

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
once we tell them the basics Vox ware

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.270 
once we tell them the basics Vox ware
tells<00:02:39.849> them<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.180> rest<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.769> kind<00:02:42.250> of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
tells them the rest it's it's kind of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.979 
tells them the rest it's it's kind of
like<00:02:42.430> working<00:02:42.849> with<00:02:42.879> a<00:02:43.000> partner<00:02:43.629> because

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
like working with a partner because

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.900 
like working with a partner because
they're<00:02:44.470> teamed<00:02:44.709> up<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.220> Vox<00:02:45.489> whereas<00:02:45.879> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
they're teamed up with Vox whereas a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.569 
they're teamed up with Vox whereas a
partner<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.900> know<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.349> it's<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.129> takes<00:02:48.160> a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
partner you know and so it's it takes a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.240 
partner you know and so it's it takes a
guy<00:02:48.840> probably<00:02:49.840> half<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.349> long<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.859> learn

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
guy probably half as long now to learn

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.300 
guy probably half as long now to learn
what<00:02:51.459> he<00:02:51.519> needs<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.910> do<00:02:52.060> Delta<00:02:52.900> Delta<00:02:53.500> 5<00:02:54.129> 6<00:02:54.700> 8<00:02:54.970> 1

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
what he needs to do Delta Delta 5 6 8 1

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.240 
what he needs to do Delta Delta 5 6 8 1
check<00:02:57.310> 8<00:02:57.579> 9<00:02:57.819> 4<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.450> think<00:02:58.720> most<00:02:59.379> definitely<00:03:00.099> it's

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
check 8 9 4 I think most definitely it's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.309 
check 8 9 4 I think most definitely it's
made<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.609> easier<00:03:00.700> for<00:03:00.940> me<00:03:01.299> being<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.629> manager<00:03:02.049> my

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
made it easier for me being a manager my

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.259 
made it easier for me being a manager my
supervisors<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.129> be<00:03:03.159> supervisors<00:03:03.760> but<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
supervisors to be supervisors but the

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.240 
supervisors to be supervisors but the
best<00:03:04.540> thing<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.930> think<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.409> is<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.829> given<00:03:06.129> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
best thing I think is is it's given the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.649 
best thing I think is is it's given the
selector<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.840> entry-level<00:03:09.120> worker<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
selector and the entry-level worker the

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.180 
selector and the entry-level worker the
opportunity<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.409> be<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> best<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.980> they<00:03:12.040> can

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
opportunity to be the best that they can

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.250 
opportunity to be the best that they can
be<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.090> there's<00:03:13.269> any<00:03:13.420> kind<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.780> incentives

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
be so if there's any kind of incentives

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.500 
be so if there's any kind of incentives
in<00:03:14.409> place<00:03:14.459> they<00:03:15.459> have<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.639> much<00:03:15.880> better<00:03:16.060> chance

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
in place they have a much better chance

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.080 
in place they have a much better chance
of<00:03:16.720> gaining<00:03:16.930> those<00:03:17.260> incentives<00:03:17.889> because<00:03:18.090> Vox

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
of gaining those incentives because Vox
