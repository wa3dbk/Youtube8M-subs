00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
now if you can measure me out some sugar

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.180

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
so get that on the heat so we've got the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.110 
so get that on the heat so we've got the
butter<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> sugar<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:47.730> syrups

in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> pan

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
in the pan

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.600 
in the pan
we<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.380> need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> melt<00:00:49.920> them<00:00:50.130> down<00:00:50.160> nicely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
we just need to melt them down nicely

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
we just need to melt them down nicely
now<00:00:50.880> this<00:00:51.060> will<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.300> start<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.200> cooking

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
now this will actually start the cooking

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.980 
now this will actually start the cooking
process<00:00:52.950> so<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.220> you're<00:00:53.340> doing<00:00:53.430> this

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
process so when you're doing this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.340 
process so when you're doing this
basically<00:00:54.990> get<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.290> tray<00:00:55.620> ready<00:00:57.230> now<00:00:58.230> I'll
