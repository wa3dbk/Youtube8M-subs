speaking of jumping around there when

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.050 
speaking of jumping around there when
you<00:02:00.860> were<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.100> Australia<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.759> were<00:02:01.820> doing<00:02:02.030> a

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
you were in Australia you were doing a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.910 
you were in Australia you were doing a
lot<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.210> pole<00:02:02.479> vaulting<00:02:02.929> are<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.439> still<00:02:03.619> doing

lot of pole vaulting are you still doing
it<00:02:04.039> um<00:02:04.340> I've<00:02:04.670> been<00:02:04.729> trying<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.179> set<00:02:05.360> up<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.539> place

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it um I've been trying to set up a place

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.630 
it um I've been trying to set up a place
to<00:02:05.899> do<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.020> here<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:06.799> it's<00:02:07.009> really<00:02:07.340> difficult

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
to do it here but it's really difficult

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.570 
to do it here but it's really difficult
because<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.509> heat<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.470> ridiculous<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
because the heat is so ridiculous that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.190 
because the heat is so ridiculous that
no<00:02:10.700> one<00:02:10.850> really<00:02:10.970> wants<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> jump<00:02:11.450> outside<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
no one really wants to jump outside and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.340 
no one really wants to jump outside and
so<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:13.010> most<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:14.049> squats<00:02:15.049> or

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
so I think most of the squats or

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.199 
so I think most of the squats or
whatever<00:02:15.680> who<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.220> train<00:02:16.459> here<00:02:16.700> kind<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.060> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.309 
you can do like some rock scrambling and
and<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.970> some<00:03:05.120> free<00:03:05.359> climbing<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.170> that

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
and and some free climbing and and that

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.960 
and and some free climbing and and that
whole<00:03:06.500> thing<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.799> it's<00:03:07.190> really<00:03:07.370> fun<00:03:07.609> as<00:03:07.850> long

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
whole thing and it's really fun as long

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.129 
whole thing and it's really fun as long
as<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.180> go<00:03:08.269> like<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.569> group<00:03:08.720> cuz<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.959> think

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
as you go like in a group cuz I think
