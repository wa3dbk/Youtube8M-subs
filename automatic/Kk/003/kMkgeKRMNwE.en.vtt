trick but he was 90 last week and now
he's<00:00:46.710> only<00:00:46.860> 89<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> shame<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.390> see

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
he's only 89 and it's a shame to see

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
he's only 89 and it's a shame to see
because<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.110> after<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.829> charity<00:00:50.250> game

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
because for me after that charity game

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
because for me after that charity game
where<00:00:50.579> he<00:00:50.610> did<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> red<00:00:51.270> card<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> was

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
where he did get the red card it was

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
where he did get the red card it was
just<00:00:52.050> unfortunate<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.550> probably<00:00:53.579> wasn't

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
just unfortunate and it probably wasn't

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
just unfortunate and it probably wasn't
a<00:00:54.239> red<00:00:54.449> card<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.500> definitely<00:00:56.010> not

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
a red card so that's definitely not

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
a red card so that's definitely not
helped<00:00:56.610> him<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.969> his<00:00:57.180> form<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.559> we'll

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
helped him in his form and but we'll

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
helped him in his form and but we'll
probably<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.100> him<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> 90<00:01:00.030> next

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
probably see him go back up to 90 next

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
probably see him go back up to 90 next

Tottenham playing very well at the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.770 
Tottenham playing very well at the
moment<00:05:26.520> like<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:27.060> said<00:05:27.120> probably<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.570> best

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
moment like I said probably the best

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.870 
moment like I said probably the best
form<00:05:28.020> he's<00:05:28.140> been<00:05:28.350> in<00:05:28.530> since<00:05:28.740> joining<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.370> he

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
form he's been in since joining and he

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.610 
form he's been in since joining and he
gets<00:05:30.090> downgraded<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.960> think<00:05:31.380> he's<00:05:31.470> being

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
gets downgraded I think he's being

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.380 
gets downgraded I think he's being
downgraded<00:05:31.800> by<00:05:32.070> two<00:05:32.190> by<00:05:32.670> the<00:05:32.730> way<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:32.970> not<00:05:33.270> just

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
downgraded by two by the way so not just

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.900 
downgraded by two by the way so not just
buy<00:05:33.570> one<00:05:33.810> but<00:05:34.020> by<00:05:34.140> two<00:05:34.200> he's<00:05:34.530> now<00:05:34.680> 77<00:05:35.370> overall

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
buy one but by two he's now 77 overall

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.820 
buy one but by two he's now 77 overall
another<00:05:36.420> defender<00:05:36.930> we<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.170> massed<00:05:37.380> assets

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
I think he'll probably going back will

I think he'll probably going back will
he<00:05:42.870> not<00:05:42.990> unless<00:05:43.290> there<00:05:43.560> is<00:05:43.590> there<00:05:43.980> was<00:05:44.280> there
