the British Isles and started to sweep

up tracking the ice as it receded but

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.140 
up tracking the ice as it receded but
then<00:00:44.080> after<00:00:44.530> about<00:00:44.620> 4000<00:00:45.580> years<00:00:45.760> ago<00:00:45.970> there

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.990 
then after about 4000 years ago there
was<00:00:46.240> a<00:00:46.590> pronounced<00:00:47.590> period<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.250> quite<00:00:48.550> rapid

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
was a pronounced period of quite rapid

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.890 
was a pronounced period of quite rapid
warming<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:51.070> probably<00:00:51.850> 3,000<00:00:52.480> years<00:00:52.690> ago

warming and by probably 3,000 years ago
there<00:00:53.320> was<00:00:53.380> no<00:00:53.590> more<00:00:53.770> Scots<00:00:54.160> pine<00:00:54.400> left<00:00:54.760> in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
there was no more Scots pine left in

there was no more Scots pine left in
England<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.390> had<00:00:55.540> naturally<00:00:56.170> moved

England that had naturally moved
northwards<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.580> was<00:00:57.700> only<00:00:57.820> left<00:00:58.150> in<00:00:58.360> Scotland

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
northwards and was only left in Scotland

northwards and was only left in Scotland
the<00:00:59.800> fact<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.250> back<00:01:00.460> here<00:01:00.700> now<00:01:00.910> is

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
the fact that it's back here now is

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.730 
the fact that it's back here now is
largely<00:01:01.540> because<00:01:01.900> it's<00:01:02.050> been<00:01:02.230> planted<00:01:02.710> here

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740

largely because it's been planted here
in<00:01:03.420> Scotland<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:05.650> were<00:01:05.740> many<00:01:06.360> national

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
in Scotland there were many national

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.810 
in Scotland there were many national

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
myths associated with Scots pine in the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.679 
same way as the English get very
attached<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:12.520> mythical<00:01:12.880> oak<00:01:13.090> woods<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
England the Scots have the similar idea

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:20.120 
England the Scots have the similar idea
that<00:01:18.460> there<00:01:18.609> were<00:01:18.700> pine<00:01:19.390> woods<00:01:19.719> that

and<00:01:22.659> particularly<00:01:23.409> that<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:23.890> was<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.130> English

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is certainly true that there were

is certainly true that there were

quite<00:01:33.549> large<00:01:33.789> extent<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.569> that<00:01:34.719> these<00:01:34.899> were

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
quite large extent and that these were

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.209 
quite large extent and that these were
felled<00:01:36.009> mostly<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.880> produce<00:01:37.030> charcoal<00:01:37.749> for

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
scotland but also in the Napoleonic Wars

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.559 
scotland but also in the Napoleonic Wars
they<00:01:44.530> were<00:01:44.590> stripped<00:01:45.249> out<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.700> then<00:01:46.149> once<00:01:46.359> the

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
they were stripped out and then once the

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.899 
they were stripped out and then once the
English<00:01:46.959> colonized<00:01:47.649> Scotland<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.490> started

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
English colonized Scotland and started

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.539 
English colonized Scotland and started
using<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.299> estates<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:49.869> rearing<00:01:50.560> deer<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
using the estates for rearing deer the

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.039 
using the estates for rearing deer the
trees<00:01:51.789> didn't<00:01:52.149> regenerate<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.840> they<00:01:52.929> never

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
trees didn't regenerate and they never

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.419 
trees didn't regenerate and they never
quite<00:01:53.380> came<00:01:53.679> back<00:01:53.920> properly

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
quite came back properly

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.429 
quite came back properly
so<00:01:55.090> there<00:01:55.209> is<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.329> certain<00:01:55.719> truth<00:01:55.990> in<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.319> that

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
so there is a certain truth in it that
