the bulk of this issue was devoted to
Scott<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.420> Emma<00:02:42.629> really<00:02:43.549> airing<00:02:44.549> out<00:02:44.730> their

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
feelings and personal I found it really

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.599 
feelings and personal I found it really
interesting<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.650> thought<00:02:49.980> when<00:02:50.489> they

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
interesting because I thought when they

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.890 
interesting because I thought when they
finally<00:02:50.819> did<00:02:51.000> air<00:02:51.180> out<00:02:51.299> their<00:02:51.480> feelings<00:02:51.840> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
finally did air out their feelings it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.240 
finally did air out their feelings it
was<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.170> go<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.319> completely<00:02:52.500> different<00:02:53.160> way

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
was gonna go a completely different way

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.860 
was gonna go a completely different way
I<00:02:53.459> thought<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.910> would<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.060> Emma<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.629> being

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
I thought it would be Emma just being

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.490 
I thought it would be Emma just being
like<00:02:55.970> still<00:02:56.970> upset<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.420> he<00:02:57.780> stole<00:02:58.260> her

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
like still upset that he stole her

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.470 
like still upset that he stole her

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
portion of the Phoenix and kind of rest

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000 
portion of the Phoenix and kind of rest
after<00:03:00.629> in<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.650> really<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:01.980> was

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
after in the back but really it was

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.589 
after in the back but really it was
almost<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> opposite<00:03:02.879> how<00:03:03.060> she's<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.450> I

almost the opposite how she's like I
kind<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.079> deserved<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:04.530> because<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.159> betrayed

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
kind of deserved that because I betrayed

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
kind of deserved that because I betrayed

very cool it's a very interesting design

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.990 
very cool it's a very interesting design
just<00:04:15.840> because<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.349> Underground<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.609> enter

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000

and<00:04:26.819> in<00:04:26.909> the<00:04:27.030> hangar<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.389> can<00:04:27.509> see<00:04:27.659> they're

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
and in the hangar you can see they're

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.080 
and in the hangar you can see they're
not<00:04:27.930> using<00:04:28.080> blackbirds<00:04:28.680> anymore<00:04:29.069> and<00:04:29.550> they

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
even have some off-limits port part

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.550 
even have some off-limits port part
right<00:04:33.030> at<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.300> bottom<00:04:33.599> I'm<00:04:33.749> not<00:04:34.139> exactly<00:04:34.379> sure

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
right at the bottom I'm not exactly sure

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.749 
right at the bottom I'm not exactly sure
what<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:34.889> going<00:04:35.099> to<00:04:35.159> be<00:04:35.279> but<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.520> could<00:04:35.669> say

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
what that's going to be but I could say

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.550 
what that's going to be but I could say
that<00:04:35.789> being<00:04:35.999> a<00:04:36.090> future<00:04:36.270> storyline<00:04:36.810> thinking

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
that being a future storyline thinking

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.439 
that being a future storyline thinking
maybe<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.860> might<00:04:38.009> be<00:04:38.069> remnants<00:04:38.819> at<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.210> weapon

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
maybe it might be remnants at the weapon

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.760 
maybe it might be remnants at the weapon
x<00:04:39.599> facility<00:04:40.050> like<00:04:40.169> there<00:04:40.349> could<00:04:40.469> be<00:04:40.529> something

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
x facility like there could be something

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.850 
x facility like there could be something
alive<00:04:41.129> still<00:04:41.460> down<00:04:41.639> there<00:04:41.879> and<00:04:42.150> had<00:04:43.050> get

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
alive still down there and had get

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.519 
alive still down there and had get
definitely<00:04:44.189> be<00:04:44.249> a<00:04:44.279> feature<00:04:44.550> story<00:04:44.580> line<00:04:44.939> yeah

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:45.529 
definitely be a feature story line yeah

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.260 
definitely be a feature story line yeah
but<00:04:46.529> my<00:04:46.889> biggest<00:04:47.310> problem<00:04:47.759> right<00:04:47.819> now<00:04:47.879> with

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
but my biggest problem right now with

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.499 
but my biggest problem right now with
the<00:04:48.689> new<00:04:49.110> Xavier<00:04:49.650> school<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.279> it<00:04:51.150> doesn't

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
the new Xavier school is it doesn't

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.700 
the new Xavier school is it doesn't
really<00:04:51.629> seem<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:52.080> built<00:04:52.379> on<00:04:52.529> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
really seem to be built on the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.950 
really seem to be built on the
principles<00:04:53.219> of<00:04:53.460> Charles<00:04:54.120> Xavier<00:04:54.210> because<00:04:54.840> he

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
principles of Charles Xavier because he

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.559 
principles of Charles Xavier because he
wanted<00:04:55.259> meetin's<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.889> humans<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.819> coexist

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
wanted meetin's and humans to coexist

where's Scott's revolution seems to be

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.320 
where's Scott's revolution seems to be
turning<00:05:01.080> more<00:05:01.379> to<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:01.740> Magneto's<00:05:02.699> old<00:05:03.060> thing

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
turning more to like Magneto's old thing
