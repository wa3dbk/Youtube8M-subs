00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 hi today i want to show you how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.170
 make your baby cream at home 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 then customized according to yours 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.570
 skin type according to your needs 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 for the uninitiated, the vine is born a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.850
 to perfect my cutaneous discs 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.060
 so it should not be a cream 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.820
 colored neither a foundation nor a cream 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.189
 moisturizing because it should not vary 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.000
 skin color but we will have to go to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 cover the blushes for some ferrets 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 however, it has no effect 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.620
 mask we say that sometimes many 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 foundation make a non however 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.350
 altering very much the color of ours 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.250
 skin 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 I wanted to make a mini cream 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.649
 in super easy version in which 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 we will start with a moisturizer 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.809

 combining the moisturizing cream with a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.260
 mineral bottom a mineral you can 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 make at home or you can 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.659
 buy the supermarket in perfumery 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.939
 minerals and to do it at home however there 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.369
 leave in the information box below the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 video the address on my article 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.720
 blog where I explain you step by step 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.509
 how to make it so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 very simple and you can make it 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 how much you want to save a lot 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.659
 really as you will see in the tutorial is a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.360
 cream that still covers why not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 remains the same color ie from a little 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.310
 colored and illuminates the rice a little 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.780
 in short, therefore I wanted to make a cream 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.180
 a bb climate 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
 it was moisturizing starting from the cream 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.900
 moisturizer for the face you use 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.630
 all day and a quantity to have 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.780
 a very covering effect that is that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 of 10 grams of mineral bottom or 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.959
 on average it still includes copies 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.610
 imperfections but not exaggerated lives on 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.170
 eight grams 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.480
 I leave you the tutorial I hope you like it 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.140
 let me know below what 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 think 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.410
 if you have any questions or concerns or requests 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.930
 hello mazzone I recommend you put 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.540
 initially if grams of mineral bottom 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.739
 in the cream and then add a gram 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.970
 the time if you want more coverage 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.300
 we will use this which is a cream 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.800
 moisturizer for the face that I use all 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.660
 the days and the mineral bottom that I have 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.519
 this is where I prepared at home 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.140
 prepared a mineral fund for the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.030
 fair complexion 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.370
 however in the information box I put you 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.410
 the link to the article on my blog with 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.720
 all indications to make it clear 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.110
 medium dark step by step 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.390
 I'm going to pour about half of the bottom 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.700
 mineral and to mix the mineral bottom 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.829
 with face cream 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 let's mix a couple of minutes 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:23.630
 I strongly recommend to do so 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.630
 mix everything well 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.920
 here it is 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.130
 after mixing a little you see that yes 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.260
 is already mixing everything well until 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.360
 not come to get this cream 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.210
 colored at this point add also 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.090
 the rest of the mineral bottom has gone to 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.630
 stir for another couple of minutes 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.120
 just like before when you get 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.150
 this cream you see there are no lumps and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.560
 simply a moisturizer 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.770
 colored from the mineral bottom here 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.770
 this is the result 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.650
 now I show you the application is 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.580
 it is also very simple to do 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.940
 simple to apply and just like one 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:15.740
 moisturizer but color TV has the face 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.600
 here you see that it is very simple and there 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.270
 I guarantee that it will make your skin 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.290
 very soft and sail will leave you hydrated 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.290
 all day hello
