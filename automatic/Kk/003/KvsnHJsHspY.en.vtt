00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.180
 and well, we're going to need paper tubes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.490
 empty hygienic of course resistol or 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.520
 silicone what you prefer too 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 let's occupy scissors 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.140
 we are going to occupy foaming of the red color and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.900
 green or equal red or green cardboard the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.390
 what do you get? 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.239
 and we are going to take care of these stickers of 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.329
 stamps of the ones we use as for 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.540
 when we are going to give something of these 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.210
 they can use 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.100
 or you can also use any 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 accessory to decorate 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.200
 and good first thing we're going to do 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.450
 let's cut here our tube and let's go 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.699
 to cut to the thickness that you want 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.640
 it depends on the amount that you go 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.720
 to do and we're going to cut the ones in this 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 look, and so we're going to cut 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.060
 we all see that you want 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.800
 since we have cut ourselves and have the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.010
 amount needed now we are going to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.820
 grab our as our cardboard 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.740
 what you choose and we will measure it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.010
 to see how much we are going to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.010
 cut 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.740
 we also measure the thickness to cut it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.780
 I like you can support this with a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.160
 ruler and a pencil to mark it and then 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.160
 cut it well from the equipment 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.460
 and good since they have cut it now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.230
 We are going to stick it with your silicon or with the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.230
 resistol or that you have chosen 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.340
 and well now we have to paste on the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.989
 sticker or accessory that you have 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.819
 chosen in this way and we are going to do 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.970
 first all the amount that you 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.280
 want to do and last we hit 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.580
 our access 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.400
 and look like that, they stayed with me 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.310
 we're just going to cut a napkin the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.220
 We doubled it up like a 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.970
 taquito we put it on our porta 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.210
 napkins and this and good is ideal for 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.470

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.120
