00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
installation wizard since this is the

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.150 
installation wizard since this is the
first<00:02:49.420> time<00:02:49.840> hitting<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.290> website<00:02:50.709> we<00:02:50.980> need

first time hitting the website we need

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.340 
first time hitting the website we need
to<00:02:51.280> give<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:54.790> need<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.090> give<00:02:55.239> dotnetnuke<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.109> few

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
to give we need to give dotnetnuke a few

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.289 
to give we need to give dotnetnuke a few
pieces<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.739> information<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.060> knows

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
pieces of information so that it knows

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.870 
pieces of information so that it knows
how<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.660> proceed<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.370> let's<00:03:00.549> go<00:03:00.670> ahead<00:03:00.730> and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
how to proceed so let's go ahead and

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.850 
how to proceed so let's go ahead and
enter<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.420> password<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:02.530> want

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.890 

and<00:03:09.860> then<00:03:10.850> we're<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.270> go<00:03:11.420> ahead<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.630> use

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
and then we're going to go ahead and use

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.510 
and then we're going to go ahead and use
the<00:03:12.110> default<00:03:12.470> template<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.160> could<00:03:13.340> use<00:03:13.490> a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
the default template we could use a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.930 
the default template we could use a
blank<00:03:13.880> template<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:14.510> we<00:03:14.690> want<00:03:15.730> we're<00:03:16.730> going<00:03:16.880> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
blank template if we want we're going to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.990 
blank template if we want we're going to
leave<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.420> languages<00:03:18.350> English<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:18.860> then<00:03:19.790> we

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
leave the languages English and then we

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.180 
leave the languages English and then we
have<00:03:20.240> our<00:03:20.510> database<00:03:21.050> we<00:03:21.380> need<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.710> set<00:03:21.890> up<00:03:22.040> now

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
have our database we need to set up now

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.910 
have our database we need to set up now
we<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.520> go<00:03:22.760> with<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.300> sequel<00:03:24.140> Express<00:03:24.680> if

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
we can go with the sequel Express if

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.650 
we can go with the sequel Express if
we've<00:03:25.130> got<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.550> installed<00:03:26.060> on<00:03:26.300> your<00:03:26.330> local

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660

we've got that installed on your local
machine<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:28.640> would<00:03:28.880> be<00:03:29.150> okay<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.230> since

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
machine that would be okay but since

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.710 
machine that would be okay but since
this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:31.460> your<00:03:31.880> installation<00:03:32.570> we

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
this is a as your installation we

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.350 
this is a as your installation we
actually<00:03:33.110> want<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.470> use<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.820> azure

tell<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:59.360> system<00:04:59.870> where<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.620> find<00:05:00.919> that

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
tell the the system where to find that

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.300 
tell the the system where to find that
user<00:05:01.490> at<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.229> then<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.380> password<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.070> just

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
user at and then the password is just

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.400 
user at and then the password is just
the<00:05:04.430> password<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.120> set<00:05:05.900> up<00:05:06.020> when<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.200> was

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
the password I set up when I was

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.770 
the password I set up when I was
creating<00:05:07.250> this

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.540 

and<00:05:14.780> then<00:05:15.320> we'll<00:05:15.530> let<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.919> wizard<00:05:16.280> run

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
and then we'll let the wizard run

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.120 
and then we'll let the wizard run
through<00:05:17.000> its<00:05:17.300> installation<00:05:17.840> steps<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.830> then

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
through its installation steps and then

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.640 
through its installation steps and then
once<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.699> installation<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.600> complete<00:05:21.080> we<00:05:21.440> can

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
once the installation is complete we can

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.219 
once the installation is complete we can
go<00:05:21.800> ahead<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.130> view<00:05:22.850> our<00:05:22.910> website<00:05:23.600> just

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
go ahead and view our website just

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.080 
go ahead and view our website just
remember<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.889> this<00:05:25.100> first<00:05:25.400> time<00:05:25.669> we<00:05:25.850> hit<00:05:25.940> the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
remember that this first time we hit the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.520 
remember that this first time we hit the
website<00:05:26.540> it's<00:05:26.750> going<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.960> be<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.110> little<00:05:27.380> bit

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
website it's going to be a little bit

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.250 
website it's going to be a little bit
slow<00:05:28.010> while<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.490> system<00:05:28.880> re<00:05:29.660> compiles

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
slow while the system re compiles

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.060 
slow while the system re compiles
everything<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.150> restarts<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:33.070> application

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
everything and restarts the application

everything and restarts the application
pool<00:05:34.370> for<00:05:34.850> asp.net<00:05:36.040> but<00:05:37.040> then<00:05:37.160> after<00:05:37.490> that

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
pool for asp.net but then after that

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:47.510 
pool for asp.net but then after that
everything<00:05:38.060> should<00:05:38.090> work<00:05:38.330> as<00:05:38.930> normal

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520
