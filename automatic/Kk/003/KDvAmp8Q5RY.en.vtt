hope you guys enjoy but let's go ahead
and<00:00:48.600> jump<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.190> theory<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and jump right into this theory so the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.560 
and jump right into this theory so the
whole<00:00:53.010> theory<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> Slenderman<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
whole theory is that Slenderman is a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
whole theory is that Slenderman is a
human<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> perspective<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.670> animal

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
human from the perspective of an animal

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
human from the perspective of an animal
now<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
now if it think about this it kind of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.260 
now if it think about this it kind of
makes<00:00:59.340> sense<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.059> break<00:01:00.239> down

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
makes sense in here I'm gonna break down

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
makes sense in here I'm gonna break down
why<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:01.020> make<00:01:01.140> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.410> sense<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
why it would make kind of sense if you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
why it would make kind of sense if you
think<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.719> Slenderman

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think about it in that way so Slenderman

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
think about it in that way so Slenderman
is<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.830> naturally<00:01:05.700> slim<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.330> tall<00:01:07.260> when

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
is on naturally slim and very tall when

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.370 
is on naturally slim and very tall when
you<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.950> him<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.900> true

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you see him now this would be very true

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
you see him now this would be very true
if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> were<00:01:10.860> thinking<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> through<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if you were thinking of this through the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
if you were thinking of this through the
eyes<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.689> animal<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.590> deer<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.490> deer

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
eyes of an animal say like a deer a deer

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570 
eyes of an animal say like a deer a deer
or<00:01:15.479> any<00:01:15.780> other<00:01:15.960> animal<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:17.250> really

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
or any other animal is really really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
or any other animal is really really
short<00:01:17.700> compared<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> human<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.290> also

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
short compared to a human and also

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
short compared to a human and also
humans<00:01:20.340> seem<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:21.060> unnaturally<00:01:22.020> thin<00:01:22.049> when

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
humans seem very unnaturally thin when

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.230 
humans seem very unnaturally thin when
you<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.830> about<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.130> compared<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> things

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you think about it compared to things

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
you think about it compared to things
like<00:01:24.420> deer<00:01:24.869> elk<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.920> anything<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> animal

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like deer elk or anything kind of animal

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
like deer elk or anything kind of animal
like<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.950> another<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:29.220> worth<00:01:29.400> pointing

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
like that another thing worth pointing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
like that another thing worth pointing
out<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> Slenderman<00:01:30.990> persistently

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
out is that Slenderman persistently

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
out is that Slenderman persistently
hunts<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.850> humans<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.420> no<00:01:33.600> matter<00:01:33.780> how

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hunts just like humans do no matter how

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.649 
hunts just like humans do no matter how
fast<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.740> how<00:01:34.770> far<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.430> run<00:01:35.479> Sunderman<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
fast or how far you run Sunderman is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.999 
fast or how far you run Sunderman is
always<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.829> he<00:01:37.920> always

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
always just kind of there he always

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:38.960 
always just kind of there he always
shows<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:38.610> up

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
shows back up

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.240 
shows back up
it<00:01:39.450> never<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:40.200> matters<00:01:40.590> how<00:01:40.710> far<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.220> run

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it never really matters how far you run

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
it never really matters how far you run
how<00:01:41.610> far<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.240> Sunderman<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.829> there

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

to get you and that fits again perfectly

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.149 
to get you and that fits again perfectly
with<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.180> theme<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> eyes<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
with the theme of going to the eyes of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
with the theme of going to the eyes of
an<00:01:50.280> animal<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:51.180> an<00:01:51.329> animal<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.020> deer<00:01:52.259> hunter<00:01:52.649> in

the in the woods it just always seems to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.209 
the in the woods it just always seems to
be<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.840> step<00:01:55.020> ahead<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:56.040> don't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
theory comes back to is it's a human
