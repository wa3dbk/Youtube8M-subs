position or dupes but I don't run any
dupes<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.740> don't<00:04:44.920> think<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.370> game<00:04:45.580> no<00:04:45.760> I

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
couple guys out of position I got

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.890 
couple guys out of position I got
Pollack<00:04:51.700> out<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:51.910> position<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.420> bowl<00:04:52.660> we're

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
out of position but I don't think that's

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.870 
out of position but I don't think that's
too<00:04:55.690> big<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:56.020> deal<00:04:56.200> it's<00:04:56.800> not<00:04:56.950> too<00:04:57.340> big<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.670> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
too big of a deal it's not too big of a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.810 
too big of a deal it's not too big of a
problem<00:04:59.970> they<00:05:00.970> play<00:05:01.150> pretty<00:05:01.480> good<00:05:01.680> i<00:05:02.760> don't<00:05:03.760> i

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
problem they play pretty good i don't i

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.760 
problem they play pretty good i don't i
don't<00:05:03.850> really<00:05:04.060> know<00:05:04.180> i<00:05:04.510> don't<00:05:05.380> want<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.650> run

them<00:05:05.890> out<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:06.010> position<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:06.670> i<00:05:06.700> don't<00:05:07.060> really

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
them out of position but i don't really

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.520 
them out of position but i don't really
have<00:05:07.390> another<00:05:07.570> choice<00:05:07.870> because<00:05:08.200> there<00:05:08.320> isn't

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
have another choice because there isn't

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.340 
have another choice because there isn't
really<00:05:08.590> another<00:05:08.860> good<00:05:09.130> luck<00:05:09.340> then<00:05:09.580> it's

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
really another good luck then it's

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.570 
really another good luck then it's
decently<00:05:11.350> cheap<00:05:11.470> that's<00:05:12.100> not<00:05:12.310> super

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
decently cheap that's not super

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.760 
decently cheap that's not super
expensive<00:05:12.940> there's<00:05:13.900> not<00:05:14.020> one<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.260> those<00:05:14.440> and

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
expensive there's not one of those and

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.720 
expensive there's not one of those and
there's<00:05:14.890> not<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.070> good<00:05:15.340> right<00:05:15.580> outside

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
there's not a good right outside

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.640 
there's not a good right outside
linebacker<00:05:16.060> because<00:05:16.660> they<00:05:16.810> move<00:05:16.990> Suggs<00:05:17.350> down

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
linebacker because they move Suggs down

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.590 
linebacker because they move Suggs down
to<00:05:17.830> write<00:05:18.010> end<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:19.090> I'm<00:05:19.150> just<00:05:19.270> going<00:05:19.390> to<00:05:19.450> have

to write end so I'm just going to have

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.700 
to write end so I'm just going to have
to<00:05:19.660> wait<00:05:19.810> until<00:05:19.960> they<00:05:20.140> release<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.440> better

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
to wait until they release a better

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.460
