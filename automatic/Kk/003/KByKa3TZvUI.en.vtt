00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.730
 once opened with the forms of cheese leftovers but today it is well established 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.900
 the use of montasio derives seasoning 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.860
 leona preparation. made from cheese can be made both soft and crunchy 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.360

 faceinhole vera. the basic missal ingredient 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.060
 onion montasio 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.780
 stop it 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.400
 first I have to prepare the polenta 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.560
 we salt the exhibition with polenta with a pinch of salt 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.700
 and then we go on to add ourselves 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.490
 our corn flour making it fall to rain always mixing with 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.490
 a whip 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.830
 the average quantity of flour polenta per liter of water varies from 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.960
 one hundred to 180 grams of skin from the consistency that one wants to obtain 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 at the end 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.820
 here we mix well until practically 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.530
 the polenta begins to take on consistency and then we cook it 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.890
 stirring from time to time or from time to time 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.370

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.040
 equal to the flow rate 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.760
 instead we prepare our minced onion 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.540
 not exactly subtly omelette but coarsely chopped 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.890
 in this case 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.530
 myswl I really like the onion but me 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 say that half an onion is more than enough 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.939
 dremora cook problem what we mix potatoes with cheese 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.589
 half of the pruning and cheese 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.219

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.209

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.929
 I'll see you 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.929
 inside the onion 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.739
