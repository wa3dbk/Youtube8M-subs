00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
were involved very much so with with

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640 
were involved very much so with with
other<00:02:09.790> people<00:02:10.200> personally<00:02:11.200> while<00:02:11.440> filming

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
other people personally while filming

other people personally while filming
the<00:02:11.830> film<00:02:12.100> but<00:02:12.610> when<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.000> see<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.240> on<00:02:13.330> screen<00:02:13.440> I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the film but when you see it on screen I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.290 
the film but when you see it on screen I
think<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.130> chemistry<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.610> great<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.240> an

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
think I chemistry is great so it's an

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.210 
think I chemistry is great so it's an
example<00:02:16.750> yet<00:02:16.900> again<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.350> how<00:02:17.620> that's<00:02:18.040> not

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
example yet again of how that's not

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.840 
example yet again of how that's not
really<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:20.800> only<00:02:20.980> come<00:02:21.310> from<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.580> script

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
really it can only come from a script

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.480 
really it can only come from a script
like<00:02:22.230> real-life<00:02:23.230> couples<00:02:23.800> don't<00:02:24.070> make<00:02:24.310> for

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
like real-life couples don't make for
