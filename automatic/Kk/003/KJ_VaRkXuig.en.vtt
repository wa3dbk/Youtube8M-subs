00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.519
 Hello with this video start the first give tools for the year 2010 who 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.910
 has already participated in the last action knows the underlying principle 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.070
 terribly easy 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
 They appreciate the simple how many subscribers lower leg on YouTube 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 on the 15th and paid 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.300
 2000 10 and 23 o'clock will have 59 and 59 seconds 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 they can give a tip for a month 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.780
 Of course it is more difficult to get the right number one month in advance 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.020
 kill as if they are typing just a few days before the goal 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.950
 that is why we have in the calculation of the winner or the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.199
 winning numbers incorporated a great dance factor 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.199
 and keep typing it from the actual date way 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.080
 the further they may be wrong to still win this 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.490
 Tolerance factor is a bit narrower than the last time it should not be 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.510
 Giving winners 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.530
 WÃ¶rth the tolerance factor as long as he expanded to anyone then 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530
 still typed correctly 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.880
 and to keep the whole thing as verifiable as possible for us again 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 a matching table on our way to a download for you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.439
 provided 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.390
 to find the children in the description 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.000
 if one now as an example here assume that he with 15 dead 2010 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.510
 If there were exactly 5,000 subscribers, then the numbers between the subscribers 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.490
 and the cap "are all the right numbers 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.020
 that means they can 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.160
 if you just take the 29 10 first you can plus minus 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.490
 a hundred miss next to this 29 fastest 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.859
 and how they would still have won Â», of course 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.370
 no one is with them in this right corridor 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 and has before them offers 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.880
 also with the prices or with the price deposited there is one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 make a change compared to the Christmas action that is not 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.070
 like in this Christmas promotion with multiple prizes at the same time 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.110
 but only with a price that has several reasons for one is not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.700
 Christmas and to others so every subscriber can decide if he has the price 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.060
 may or may not use and if not just do not join in and on 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.409
 the next action already had this in the planning 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.459
 Sponsor of this is Samsung Electronics who asked us what 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.689
 we would like to have and we answered we said four 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.189
 Gigabyte of RAM we would like to have thought more about us many of us 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.349
 Viewers have nothing against a little program from picture on 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.549
 The price of these two modules, according to the dialogues, varies according to the dealer 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.589
 somewhere between 100 and 150 euros so thank you very much again s.Samsung 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.009
 very nice thing we hope that she is doing well and that ours too 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.689
 Sponsor at the end of the day 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.260
 and at the end of the auction is satisfied with that then they already have 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.259
 hinted there's a lot more in the pipeline 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.889
 future will grow 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.039
 the exact information what exactly those space building blocks are you will find 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.309
 our homepage link in the video description 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.059
 So you can check out if these stones are even available to you 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.809
 fit 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.069
 So join in is worth several victories or your PC for several reasons 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.400
 urgently needs a room covering or you know someone of the 1 need them 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.599
 want to make themselves popular 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.839
 or they do whatever drives us 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.259
 as a kind of exercise because maybe you can here 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.539
 my next winner chooses action need something or snappy already 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.539
 basically how it works 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.439
 little tip to the conclusion and I do not know if I'm the first 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.609
 maybe a couple of days to tap how many but it would 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.369
 will get so on the day and try to figure out something else 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.599
 Among other things, you can find data on our homepage where we have a kind of min 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.269
 The list also shows some numbers 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.889
 our ultimate goal 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.919
 Just scroll down to the bottom 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.869
 We have listed once at which time the 1000 inhabitants reached 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:03.879
 had 2000 3000 and currently cast and structure after 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.879
 the 4000 a limit 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.989
 otherwise, of course, always prefer something too high, the price too low in the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.769
 Emergency to beat your own friends who temporarily push up the AWO number 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.319
 should 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.539
 so that they end up in the hit 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.539
 which forgot something come as an image behind 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.969
 have fun
