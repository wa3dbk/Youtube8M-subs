00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.090

 increase engine power 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.780
 a lot of things that do not even work for you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.030
 move here and here guys you can 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 add a loose wheel something on 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.329
 your bus 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.979

 So I'll let you find out 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.830
 The way you get down there goes 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 I was going to get there and then it's all done 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.790
 Modify a bus you come to confirm 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 to choose the concessionaire that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.820
 you want to save the truck save the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.530
 way does not save the bus and what 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.830
 After you have done this guys 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.840
 you can drive only if the range of 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.560
 Bus if you do not have there guys 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.340
 You do not even have business management. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.870
 garage management recalls and now 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.000
 I think you saved the bus. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.920
 and here it will be, it 's just click on it 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.580
 there will forever downs and click 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.740
 down in case they have this option to drive 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.410
 because one of them appears to me because I already 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.730
 I'm a bus and if you do not have one 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.990
 eyed for this option direct only 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 click on drive 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.840

 off the camera the inside 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.720
 I think from the top I think it 's in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.970
 top of the bus that camera is on the floor 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.360
