it<00:02:08.149> will<00:02:08.360> take<00:02:08.630> roughly<00:02:09.110> around<00:02:09.800> 10<00:02:10.310> years<00:02:10.910> or

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
it will take roughly around 10 years or

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.830 
it will take roughly around 10 years or
so<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:13.069> continues<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:14.150> know<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.540> one

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
so if this continues you know with one

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.250 
so if this continues you know with one
episode<00:02:15.350> each<00:02:15.500> year<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:16.760> still<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.269> about

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
episode each year but still have about

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320 
episode each year but still have about
like<00:02:18.739> nine<00:02:19.010> episodes<00:02:19.580> after<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.940> third<00:02:20.150> one

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
like nine episodes after the third one

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.559 
like nine episodes after the third one
the<00:02:21.050> Dragon<00:02:21.530> will<00:02:21.620> arm<00:02:21.800> some<00:02:21.980> series<00:02:22.310> will<00:02:22.430> be

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
the Dragon will arm some series will be

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.550 
the Dragon will arm some series will be
over<00:02:23.569> by<00:02:24.850> 2024<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.180> know<00:02:26.269> that's<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.780> long<00:02:27.140> time

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560

over by 2024 you know that's a long time
from<00:02:28.310> now<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.569> think<00:02:29.780> people<00:02:30.140> can

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
from now and I don't think people can

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.520 
from now and I don't think people can
wait<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.830> long<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.100> Dragon<00:02:31.730> optional<00:02:32.239> now

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
and give I don't know if that's possible

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.660 
and give I don't know if that's possible
but<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.049> just<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.350> suggestion<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:40.250> my<00:02:40.459> own

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670

he will be really cool if Novelli could

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.809 
he will be really cool if Novelli could
make<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:44.000> 2<00:02:44.239> episodes<00:02:44.680> per<00:02:45.680> year<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.580> way

five years four and a half years could

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.580 
five years four and a half years could
possibly<00:02:53.209> take<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> series<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.200> be<00:02:54.230> over

that to happen

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.119 
that to happen
pretty<00:03:31.269> much<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.050> like<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.410> said<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.950> will<00:03:33.099> be

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
pretty much but like I said it will be

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.790 
pretty much but like I said it will be
pretty<00:03:33.489> awesome<00:03:33.700> if<00:03:33.970> melimeli<00:03:34.510> could<00:03:34.840> step<00:03:35.680> it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
pretty awesome if melimeli could step it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.650 
pretty awesome if melimeli could step it
up<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.980> little<00:03:36.099> bit<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.459> maybe<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:37.269> next

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
up a little bit and maybe the next

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.759 
up a little bit and maybe the next
episode<00:03:38.170> comes<00:03:38.470> out<00:03:38.680> early<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:40.349> next<00:03:41.349> year<00:03:41.590> or

episode comes out early of next year or

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.410 
episode comes out early of next year or
maybe<00:03:41.830> even<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.430> year<00:03:42.849> we<00:03:42.970> don't<00:03:43.150> know<00:03:43.269> we'll

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
maybe even this year we don't know we'll

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.300 
maybe even this year we don't know we'll
have<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.629> wait<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:43.989> see<00:03:44.049> but<00:03:44.769> like<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.040> said<00:03:45.099> I

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
have to wait and see but like I said I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.369 
have to wait and see but like I said I
can<00:03:45.640> only<00:03:45.819> assume<00:03:46.000> since<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.720> haven't<00:03:46.989> seen<00:03:47.200> any

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
can only assume since I haven't seen any

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.140 
can only assume since I haven't seen any
update<00:03:47.769> on<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.950> episodes<00:03:48.519> guys<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.970> we

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
update on the episodes guys that we

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.500 
update on the episodes guys that we
still<00:03:49.510> are<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.129> 12<00:03:51.670> episode<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
still are on on the 12 episode the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.470 
still are on on the 12 episode the
number<00:03:52.959> hasn't<00:03:53.500> changed<00:03:53.799> at<00:03:54.610> least<00:03:54.970> from<00:03:55.269> what

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
number hasn't changed at least from what

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.690 
number hasn't changed at least from what
I<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.780> haven't<00:03:55.989> seen<00:03:56.290> any<00:03:56.470> update<00:03:56.890> nor

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
I know I haven't seen any update nor

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.199 
I know I haven't seen any update nor
from<00:03:58.209> Malvolio<00:03:58.630> or<00:03:58.959> from<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> co-writer

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
from Malvolio or from the co-writer

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.420 
from Malvolio or from the co-writer
cancelling<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.239> other<00:04:01.599> 12<00:04:02.019> episodes<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:03.400> I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
cancelling that other 12 episodes but I

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.740 
cancelling that other 12 episodes but I
guess<00:04:03.640> we'll<00:04:03.849> have<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.000> wait<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.329> see<00:04:04.390> but<00:04:04.510> as

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
guess we'll have to wait and see but as
