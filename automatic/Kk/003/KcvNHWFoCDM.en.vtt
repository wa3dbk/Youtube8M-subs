00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
as always with the xposed framework

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.180 
as always with the xposed framework
applications<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:58.070> activate<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
applications we have to activate the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.270

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
model and to do that we have to check

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.800 
model and to do that we have to check
the<00:01:02.730> model<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.690> xposed<00:01:04.350> installer<00:01:04.530> and

the model in the xposed installer and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.620 
the model in the xposed installer and
reboot<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:07.560> phone<00:01:08.340> afterwards

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.240 

alright<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> after<00:01:13.049> rebooting<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.920> device

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
alright and after rebooting your device

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
alright and after rebooting your device
you<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> new<00:01:15.479> application

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you will now have this new application

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.980 
you will now have this new application
called<00:01:16.590> root<00:01:17.009> cloak<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
called root cloak and in it you can

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.219 
called root cloak and in it you can
actually<00:01:19.170> add<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.369> remove<00:01:20.580> applications

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
actually add and remove applications

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
actually add and remove applications
from<00:01:22.229> being<00:01:22.710> able<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.970> device

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
from being able to see that your device

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
from being able to see that your device
is<00:01:24.420> rooted<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
is rooted so you will have to add the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.359 
is rooted so you will have to add the
application<00:01:27.350> manually<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
application manually because not all of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.850 
application manually because not all of
the<00:01:29.670> apps<00:01:29.759> are<00:01:30.060> automatically<00:01:30.720> added<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.740> in

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the apps are automatically added so in

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.969 
the apps are automatically added so in
my<00:01:31.979> case<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> Nokia<00:01:32.970> Z<00:01:33.180> launcher<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
my case it's the Nokia Z launcher and

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
my case it's the Nokia Z launcher and
it's<00:01:34.979> adding<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.060> simply<00:01:36.540> stacking<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's adding it is simply stacking on it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's adding it is simply stacking on it
but<00:01:38.280> no<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> app<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.549> does

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
but no as you can see the app still does

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.300 
but no as you can see the app still does
not<00:01:41.729> allow<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> run<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.100> sees

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
not allow me to run it because it sees

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.999 
not allow me to run it because it sees
I'm<00:01:44.520> rooted<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> bug<00:01:46.799> or

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
I'm rooted but it's not a bug or

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.950 
I'm rooted but it's not a bug or
anything<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
anything we just have to go to the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
anything we just have to go to the
application<00:01:49.500> settings<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> force<00:01:50.610> stop<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
application settings and force stop it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620 
application settings and force stop it
and<00:01:51.799> know<00:01:52.799> once<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.490> run<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> application<00:01:54.479> as

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and know once I run the application as

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.850 
and know once I run the application as
you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.920> works<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.240> intended<00:01:57.860> so
