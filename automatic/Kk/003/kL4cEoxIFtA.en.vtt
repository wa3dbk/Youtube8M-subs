00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:15.900 

okay<00:00:03.470> then<00:00:03.950> we<00:00:04.100> add<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:04.400> third<00:00:04.990> rather

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.590 

that's<00:00:19.030> G<00:00:21.580> how<00:00:22.580> many<00:00:22.760> of<00:00:22.850> those<00:00:23.030> can<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.300> find

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
that's G how many of those can you find

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.640 
that's G how many of those can you find
this<00:00:23.780> place<00:00:23.960> we<00:00:24.230> have<00:00:24.260> there<00:00:26.380> then<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:27.500> have

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
this place we have there then we have

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.410 
this place we have there then we have
the<00:00:27.770> fifth<00:00:28.070> we<00:00:28.370> just<00:00:28.580> learned<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:28.880> don't

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
the fifth we just learned that don't

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.729 
the fifth we just learned that don't
have<00:00:29.540> it<00:00:30.310> then<00:00:31.310> we<00:00:31.430> have<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.700> third<00:00:32.739> string

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
have it then we have the third string

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.800 
have it then we have the third string
and<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:33.980> can<00:00:34.100> sound<00:00:34.280> good<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:34.700> place<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.540> bass

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
and I can sound good to you place a bass

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:49.569 
and I can sound good to you place a bass
line<00:00:45.400> in<00:00:46.400> that<00:00:46.940> case<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.620> next<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
line in that case so the next so the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.620 
line in that case so the next so the
next<00:00:49.760> exercise<00:00:49.910> is<00:00:50.360> finding<00:00:50.690> all

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.930 

but<00:00:58.630> just<00:00:58.840> play<00:00:59.580> practices<00:01:00.580> as<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:01.000> pager

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.660 

this<00:01:06.080> actually<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.230> is<00:01:07.380> called<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this actually this is called this is a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.950 
this actually this is called this is a
good<00:01:09.000> position<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.660> your<00:01:09.720> objection

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
good position of your objection

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
good position of your objection
then<00:01:12.530> when<00:01:13.280> you're<00:01:13.400> styling<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> then

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
then when you're styling and then

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.440 
then when you're styling and then
further<00:01:14.930> let's<00:01:15.620> call<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.160> first<00:01:16.880> inversion

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
further let's call the first inversion

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.800 
further let's call the first inversion
I'm<00:01:17.900> taking<00:01:18.290> an<00:01:18.380> octave<00:01:18.680> down<00:01:19.480> if<00:01:20.480> you<00:01:20.600> may

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
I'm taking an octave down if you may

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.170 
I'm taking an octave down if you may
from<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.140> feds<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.680> third<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.000> could

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
from the feds of the third and you could

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.230 
from the feds of the third and you could
play<00:01:23.330> from<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.600> fifth<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> fifth<00:01:25.240> it's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
play from the fifth to the fifth it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.210 
play from the fifth to the fifth it's
called<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.660> second<00:01:27.080> inversion<00:01:27.350> will<00:01:27.710> return

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
called the second inversion will return

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.120 
called the second inversion will return
to<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> but<00:01:29.180> now<00:01:29.330> we<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:32.950> that's<00:01:33.950> how

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
to that but now we have the that's how

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.670 
to that but now we have the that's how
many<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.850> she<00:01:35.180> tried<00:01:35.570> notice<00:01:36.080> quite<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.500> lot

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
many of the she tried notice quite a lot

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.830 
many of the she tried notice quite a lot
I<00:01:36.710> can<00:01:36.920> play<00:01:37.070> in<00:01:37.220> this<00:01:37.310> position<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.390> go<00:01:38.600> up

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
I can play in this position then I go up

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:50.200 
I can play in this position then I go up
to<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.110> next<00:01:39.260> one<00:01:39.530> here<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.430> use<00:01:50.000> this

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
to the next one here and I use this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.600 
to the next one here and I use this
often<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.020> see<00:01:51.170> now<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> lot<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:51.979> try

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
often if you see now I have a lot of try

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.280 
often if you see now I have a lot of try
and<00:01:52.640> I'll<00:01:52.940> see<00:01:53.119> if<00:01:53.149> I<00:01:53.450> play<00:01:53.660> something<00:01:53.960> based

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
and I'll see if I play something based

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:07.240 
and I'll see if I play something based
on<00:01:54.440> here<00:02:03.940> then<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.210> move<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.170> quickly<00:02:06.800> up

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
on here then I can move so quickly up

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.090 
on here then I can move so quickly up
because<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.290> target<00:02:09.290> notes<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.860> see

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
because I have the target notes to see

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.390 
because I have the target notes to see
here<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:11.000> them<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.660> course<00:02:12.400> practice

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
here and I have them of course practice

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.840 
here and I have them of course practice
the<00:02:13.700> shape<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.750> arpeggios<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:16.010> same<00:02:16.310> goes

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the shape of the arpeggios the same goes

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:31.780 
the shape of the arpeggios the same goes
from<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.500> patience<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.160> really<00:02:31.459> good

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
from the so patience is really good

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.949 
from the so patience is really good
thing<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.570> practice<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:35.480> course<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
thing to to practice and of course the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.940 
thing to to practice and of course the
fingering<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.769> vary<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.870> doesn't<00:02:39.470> want<00:02:39.680> for

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
fingering can vary it doesn't want for

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.860 
fingering can vary it doesn't want for
par<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.640> project<00:02:41.090> don't<00:02:41.299> always<00:02:41.510> play<00:02:41.840> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
par to the project don't always play a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
par to the project don't always play a
c-major<00:02:42.440> try<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.280> this

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.920 

and<00:02:48.340> also<00:02:48.520> pay<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> freshmen<00:02:49.480> like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.750 

if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.080> all<00:02:55.230> always<00:02:55.709> find<00:02:55.980> variation<00:02:56.580> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
if you all always find variation in

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.930 
if you all always find variation in
figuring<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.459> sounds<00:02:59.459> different

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
figuring because this sounds different

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.800 
figuring because this sounds different
than<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.200> much<00:03:01.470> fuller<00:03:02.810> especially

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
than this this is much fuller especially

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.699 
than this this is much fuller especially
if<00:03:03.959> you're<00:03:04.080> playing<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.379> bass<00:03:04.739> line<00:03:04.769> this

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.059 

sounds<00:03:10.709> different<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.900> also<00:03:16.230> has

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
sounds different and it also has

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.470 
sounds different and it also has
something<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.430> weigh<00:03:17.790> around<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:18.299> base

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
something to weigh around the base

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.190 
something to weigh around the base
points<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.200> plane<00:03:19.440> II<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.390> want<00:03:22.110> to

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
points if a plane II I can I want to

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.869 
points if a plane II I can I want to
play<00:03:22.319> this<00:03:24.590> an<00:03:25.590> octave<00:03:26.099> below<00:03:26.129> what<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.849> I

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
play this an octave below what I can I

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.830 
play this an octave below what I can I
use<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.209> figure<00:03:27.450> because<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> same

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
use this figure because that's the same

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.699 
use this figure because that's the same
as<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> always<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:37.049> different

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
as this so always know different

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.020 
as this so always know different
fingerings<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.370> your<00:03:39.500> pages<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.519> talked

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
fingerings for your pages so I talked

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.000 
fingerings for your pages so I talked
about<00:03:42.079> inversions<00:03:43.079> before<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:43.739> good

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
about inversions before and that's good

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
about inversions before and that's good
thing<00:03:44.190> too<00:03:44.370> when<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:44.940> practice<00:03:45.329> these<00:03:45.450> are

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
thing too when you practice these are

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.170 
thing too when you practice these are

pages practice practice to start with a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.720 
pages practice practice to start with a

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.300 
loop precision one three five one
not<00:03:51.329> now<00:03:51.629> I'm<00:03:51.690> not<00:03:51.930> saying<00:03:52.170> root<00:03:52.530> third<00:03:53.069> fifth

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
not now I'm not saying root third fifth

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.199 
not now I'm not saying root third fifth
I'm<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.849> saying<00:03:54.030> one<00:03:54.329> three<00:03:54.900> five<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:56.209> one

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
I'm just saying one three five one one

I'm just saying one three five one one
three<00:03:57.840> five<00:03:58.319> one<00:03:58.669> and<00:03:59.669> then<00:03:59.790> go<00:04:00.000> back<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.389> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
three five one and then go back to the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.500 
three five one and then go back to the
free<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.760> repeat<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.849> same<00:04:03.060> pattern<00:04:03.329> just

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
free and repeat the same pattern just

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.530 
free and repeat the same pattern just
starting<00:04:04.049> as<00:04:04.230> step<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:05.040> higher<00:04:05.220> three<00:04:05.940> five

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
starting as step for higher three five

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.539 
starting as step for higher three five
one<00:04:06.900> three<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.209> start<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.049> five<00:04:10.950> one

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
one three and you start on the five one

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.469 
one three and you start on the five one
three<00:04:12.680> five<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.599> one<00:04:15.829> three<00:04:16.829> five<00:04:17.489> one<00:04:17.910> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
three five and one three five one and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.900 
three five and one three five one and
this<00:04:19.109> instance<00:04:19.590> maybe<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.220> want<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.579> change

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
this instance maybe you want to change

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.080 
this instance maybe you want to change
the<00:04:21.030> finger<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:22.910> or<00:04:23.910> start<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.510> up<00:04:24.630> here

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.159 

so<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.680> first<00:04:28.889> one<00:04:31.460> okay<00:04:32.460> we<00:04:32.730> have<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.810> our

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
so the first one okay we have to see our

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.040 
so the first one okay we have to see our
finger<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.620> exactly<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.490> part<00:04:35.910> that's<00:04:36.690> okay

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
finger in exactly this part that's okay

00:04:37.050 --> 00:05:07.040 
finger in exactly this part that's okay
when<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.680> go<00:04:37.830> from<00:04:37.950> this<00:05:05.570> so<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.630> can<00:05:06.780> see<00:05:06.900> now

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
when I go from this so you can see now

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.620 
when I go from this so you can see now
if<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.800> have<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.130> intention<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:12.950> can<00:05:13.950> move

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
if I have this intention I can move

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:29.510 
if I have this intention I can move
Swift<00:05:15.630> from<00:05:16.080> one<00:05:16.290> position<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.040> other

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.580 

the<00:05:30.520> key<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.940> is<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.510> picking<00:05:31.900> also<00:05:32.320> when<00:05:32.500> you

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
the key to is to picking also when you

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.860 
the key to is to picking also when you
have<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:32.890> position<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.670> get<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.480> seen

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
have this position and you get it seen

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.310 
have this position and you get it seen
up<00:05:35.080> here<00:05:35.290> so<00:05:35.500> yeah<00:05:35.710> this<00:05:36.040> little<00:05:36.220> film<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:37.320> to

up here so yeah this little film it to
me<00:05:38.790> I<00:05:39.790> just<00:05:40.690> say<00:05:40.990> it's<00:05:48.300> okay<00:05:49.300> there<00:05:49.930> was<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
me I just say it's okay there was a

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.630 
me I just say it's okay there was a
little<00:05:50.260> bit<00:05:50.470> about<00:05:50.680> apertures<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.340> how<00:05:51.580> to

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
little bit about apertures and how to

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.040 
little bit about apertures and how to
know<00:05:51.880> your<00:05:52.060> fingerboard<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:52.750> can<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.020> course

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
know your fingerboard you can of course

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.340 
know your fingerboard you can of course
also<00:05:53.500> do<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.920> with<00:05:54.490> all<00:05:54.730> other<00:05:55.270> core<00:05:55.750> types<00:05:56.050> now

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
also do it with all other core types now

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.700 
also do it with all other core types now
we<00:05:56.410> take<00:05:56.680> them<00:05:56.860> we<00:05:57.700> took<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.090> major<00:05:58.360> try<00:05:58.710> do

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
we take them we took the major try do

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:23.760 
we take them we took the major try do
the<00:05:59.860> same<00:06:00.100> with<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.370> minor<00:06:00.610> C<00:06:01.150> minor<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:23.320> pages

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
the same with the minor C minor a pages

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.070 
the same with the minor C minor a pages
and<00:06:24.010> a<00:06:24.100> minor<00:06:24.340> minor<00:06:24.850> tries<00:06:25.150> always<00:06:25.600> makes<00:06:25.960> me

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
and a minor minor tries always makes me

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.590 
and a minor minor tries always makes me
think<00:06:26.230> of<00:06:26.380> reggae<00:06:26.800> it's<00:06:27.040> a<00:06:27.190> so<00:06:27.700> common<00:06:28.030> so<00:06:28.480> it's

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
think of reggae it's a so common so it's

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.670 
think of reggae it's a so common so it's
the<00:06:28.660> same<00:06:28.990> principle

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
the same principle

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.950 
the same principle
one<00:06:30.330> now<00:06:31.330> it's<00:06:31.510> just<00:06:31.600> be<00:06:31.870> three<00:06:32.200> five<00:06:32.950> one<00:06:33.960> if

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
one now it's just be three five one if

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.870 
one now it's just be three five one if
we<00:06:35.140> do<00:06:35.290> it<00:06:35.410> in<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.620> inversion<00:06:36.330> inversions

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.070 

that<00:06:43.880> was<00:06:43.970> a<00:06:44.000> good<00:06:44.150> part<00:06:44.390> it<00:06:44.630> is<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.840> know<00:06:44.930> your

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
that was a good part it is you know your

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.820 
that was a good part it is you know your
