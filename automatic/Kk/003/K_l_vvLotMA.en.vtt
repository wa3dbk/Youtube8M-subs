I posted I'm posting this for the geek
and<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.980> said<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> put<00:00:26.970> up

today<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.429> figured<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.210> video<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.720> easier<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
today I figured the video is easier to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.440 
today I figured the video is easier to
do<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.679> also<00:00:31.859> probably<00:00:32.460> more<00:00:32.940> meaningful<00:00:33.420> for

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
do but also probably more meaningful for

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
do but also probably more meaningful for
you<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> true<00:00:34.649> experience<00:00:35.070> but

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you so you get the true experience but

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
you so you get the true experience but
just<00:00:36.030> starting<00:00:36.570> off<00:00:36.719> looking<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> box

just feels and looks better and for me
that<00:00:57.270> makes<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.530> experience

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
there's a 10 Sider in here somewhere

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
there's a 10 Sider in here somewhere
there<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> let<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.470> start<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
there it is but let me start with the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
there it is but let me start with the
rulebook<00:01:13.909> 32<00:01:14.909> pages<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.210> newer

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
rulebook 32 pages and it's on this newer

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690 
rulebook 32 pages and it's on this newer
paper<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.590> GMT<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.009> using<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.640> don't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
paper that GMT is using which I don't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520 
paper that GMT is using which I don't
like<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.299> mean<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.380> really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like I mean that for me it's just really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
like I mean that for me it's just really
not<00:01:22.770> holding<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.060> difficult<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
not holding up at all it's difficult to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
not holding up at all it's difficult to
take<00:01:25.170> notes<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.520> durable

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
take notes in but it's just not durable

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810 
take notes in but it's just not durable
but<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> upside<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> prints<00:01:29.610> in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
but the upside is is that it prints in

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
but the upside is is that it prints in
color<00:01:30.140> which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.320> great<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> can

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
color which is great and so you can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.630 
color which is great and so you can
quickly<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.869> design<00:01:34.680> notes<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.369> jump

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
quickly see the design notes just jump

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240 
quickly see the design notes just jump
out<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.689> let<00:01:37.470> me<00:01:37.619> show<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> little

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
out at you and let me show you a little

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.179 
out at you and let me show you a little
bit<00:01:39.200> historical<00:01:40.200> notes<00:01:40.380> which<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
bit historical notes which are really

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.330 
bit historical notes which are really
fun<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> read<00:01:42.079> and<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:43.680> idea<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
fun to read and you get an idea of you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.620 
fun to read and you get an idea of you
know<00:01:44.369> great<00:01:45.259> examples<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> play<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> color

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
know great examples of play so the color

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
know great examples of play so the color
really<00:01:48.869> helps<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> feel<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.070> they've

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
really helps and I feel like they've

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.210 
really helps and I feel like they've
designed<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> lot<00:01:51.360> better<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> examples

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
designed these a lot better the examples

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.770 
designed these a lot better the examples
of<00:01:53.340> play<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.790> book<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
of play in this book so that there's a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
of play in this book so that there's a
lot<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.020> clarity<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> read<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> rules<00:01:56.070> last

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lot more clarity I read the rules last

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.480 
lot more clarity I read the rules last
night<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> lot<00:01:58.799> better<00:01:59.130> feel

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
night and you just get a lot better feel

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.649 
night and you just get a lot better feel
for<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> game<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.450> might<00:02:00.630> be

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
for the game now some of that might be

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.469 
for the game now some of that might be
that<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.259> familiar<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> system<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that I'm familiar with the system and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240 
that I'm familiar with the system and
it's<00:02:03.719> primarily<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.380> same<00:02:04.740> there's<00:02:05.040> there

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's primarily the same there's there

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's primarily the same there's there
are<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:05.610> changes<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.479> represent<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> period

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
are some changes to represent the period

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.589 
are some changes to represent the period
but<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> rulebook<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.450> done

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but I think the rulebook is just done

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.990 
but I think the rulebook is just done
really<00:02:09.629> well<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> color<00:02:11.160> then

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
really well because of the color then

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640 
really well because of the color then
you<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> player<00:02:12.569> aid<00:02:12.780> charts

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you have the player aid charts

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.780 
you have the player aid charts
of<00:02:13.890> which<00:02:14.220> there's<00:02:14.519> two<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> standard

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
of which there's two for the standard

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.360 
of which there's two for the standard
table<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.409> standard<00:02:19.409> table<00:02:19.799> two<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
table one standard table two for the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.339 
table one standard table two for the
players<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.299> there's<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.720> simple<00:02:21.989> G

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
players and then there's the simple G

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.970 
players and then there's the simple G
boah<00:02:22.709> charts<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.140> already<00:02:25.379> see<00:02:25.769> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
boah charts but you can already see you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.559 
boah charts but you can already see you
know<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.220> good<00:02:26.370> cardstock<00:02:26.909> as<00:02:27.090> always<00:02:27.390> but

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
know it's good cardstock as always but

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.470 
know it's good cardstock as always but
here<00:02:28.470> again<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.069> color<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.940> looks<00:02:29.970> great

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
here again it's in color it looks great

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.210 
here again it's in color it looks great
and<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> makes<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.440> such<00:02:31.650> an<00:02:31.799> easier

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and it makes it just such an easier

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.809 
and it makes it just such an easier
reference<00:02:32.730> tool<00:02:34.069> just<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.250> follow<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.640> hip

nothing<00:02:45.900> new<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:47.040> G<00:02:47.549> boah<00:02:47.879> players<00:02:48.269> except

nothing new for G boah players except

nothing new for G boah players except
that<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.019> just<00:02:49.230> looks<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.769> better<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
that it just looks a lot better and

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.759 
that it just looks a lot better and
because<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> looks<00:02:51.239> better<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.870> think<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
because it looks better the I think that

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.220 
because it looks better the I think that
data<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> lot<00:02:53.400> more<00:02:53.579> manageable<00:02:54.109> look<00:02:55.109> at

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
data is a lot more manageable look at

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.619 
data is a lot more manageable look at
this<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> love<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> lot<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.269> game

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
this this one I love a lot it's the game

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.270 
this this one I love a lot it's the game
turn<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:59.190> route<00:02:59.370> point<00:02:59.959> charts<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.739> even

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
turn and the route point charts so even

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.880 
turn and the route point charts so even
in<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.810> Chariots<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.870> Fire<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.739> a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
in of Chariots of Fire this is just a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.920 
in of Chariots of Fire this is just a
black<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.489> white<00:03:05.579> piece<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.180> cardstock<00:03:06.450> but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
black and white piece of cardstock but

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.839 
black and white piece of cardstock but
you<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.129> see<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> theme<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.640> this

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
you know you can see the theme of this

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.479 
you know you can see the theme of this
video<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.780> looks<00:03:09.989> better<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:11.280> makes

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
video just looks better and that makes

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.330 
video just looks better and that makes
for<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> better<00:03:11.819> play<00:03:12.480> experience<00:03:13.019> for<00:03:13.379> me<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
for a better play experience for me and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.659 
for a better play experience for me and
I<00:03:14.489> think<00:03:14.940> most<00:03:15.239> people<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.349> counters<00:03:16.799> are<00:03:17.129> the

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
I think most people the counters are the

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.199 
I think most people the counters are the
typical<00:03:18.120> work<00:03:18.329> which<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.079> fantastic<00:03:19.319> by

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
typical work which is fantastic by

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.900 
typical work which is fantastic by
McGowan<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.269> company<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.950> nothing<00:03:23.549> out<00:03:23.849> of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
McGowan and company so nothing out of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.569 
McGowan and company so nothing out of
the<00:03:24.180> ordinary<00:03:24.209> here<00:03:25.160> some<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.280> Persian

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
the ordinary here some of the Persian

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.690 
the ordinary here some of the Persian
chariots<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:28.709> know<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.010> infantry<00:03:29.459> looks

let me show you this one though you'll
start<00:03:33.599> seeing<00:03:33.840> what<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> Phalanx<00:03:34.829> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
start seeing what the Phalanx the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.099 
start seeing what the Phalanx the
hoplite<00:03:35.790> phalanx<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.419> look<00:03:36.629> like<00:03:36.810> they're<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
hoplite phalanx is look like they're the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.589 
hoplite phalanx is look like they're the
double<00:03:37.379> counters<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> I'll<00:03:39.030> zoom<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.450> little

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
double counters so I'll zoom in a little

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.770 
double counters so I'll zoom in a little
bit<00:03:39.810> those<00:03:40.079> look<00:03:40.260> great<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.940> let's<00:03:42.510> see<00:03:42.690> if

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
bit those look great so let's see if

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.869 
bit those look great so let's see if
there's<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.019> comparison<00:03:43.709> for<00:03:43.949> you<00:03:43.980> here's<00:03:44.819> a

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
there's a comparison for you here's a

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.780 
there's a comparison for you here's a
normal<00:03:45.239> sized<00:03:45.389> counter<00:03:45.870> there's<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.230> double

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
normal sized counter there's the double

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.930 
normal sized counter there's the double
then<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.389> this<00:03:48.660> one<00:03:49.169> called<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.669> think

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
then you get this one called the I think

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.330 
then you get this one called the I think
it's<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.150> pronounced<00:03:51.569> fee<00:03:51.840> or<00:03:52.260> Pheebs<00:03:52.560> but

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's just pronounced fee or Pheebs but

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's just pronounced fee or Pheebs but
this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.669> almost<00:03:53.819> a<00:03:54.030> quad<00:03:54.329> counter<00:03:54.949> there's<00:03:55.949> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
this is almost a quad counter there's a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.710 
this is almost a quad counter there's a
single<00:03:56.459> there's<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.730> double<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.419> more

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
single there's a double this is more

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.150 
single there's a double this is more
than<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> quad<00:03:58.230> there's<00:03:58.560> only<00:03:58.680> one<00:03:58.889> of<00:03:59.010> these

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
than a quad there's only one of these

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.580 
than a quad there's only one of these
and<00:03:59.609> I<00:04:00.480> think<00:04:00.810> it's<00:04:00.959> only<00:04:01.079> for<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.560> very

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
and I think it's only for a very

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.089 
and I think it's only for a very
specific<00:04:02.129> scenario<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.870> having<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.680> bad

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
specific scenario but having that bad

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.710 
specific scenario but having that bad
boy<00:04:05.280> sit<00:04:05.579> out<00:04:05.699> on<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.940> math<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.389> going<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.629> be

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
boy sit out on the math is going to be

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.610 
boy sit out on the math is going to be
very<00:04:06.810> nice<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.819> then<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.940> course<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.930> just

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
very nice and then of course that just

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.129 
very nice and then of course that just
the<00:04:10.739> counters<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.449> adjudicate<00:04:12.449> the<00:04:12.569> game<00:04:12.780> that

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
the counters to adjudicate the game that

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.689 
the counters to adjudicate the game that
will<00:04:13.470> all<00:04:13.680> be<00:04:13.709> used<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.370> you've<00:04:14.489> played<00:04:14.609> the

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
will all be used to if you've played the

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.900 
will all be used to if you've played the
series<00:04:15.090> before<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:16.650> maps<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:17.400> which<00:04:17.609> there

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
series before the maps of which there

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.039 
series before the maps of which there
are<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:19.010> believe<00:04:20.010> six<00:04:20.880> when<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:21.479> count<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
are I believe six when you count the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.950 
are I believe six when you count the
front<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.409> back

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
front and back

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.010 
front and back
and<00:04:24.170> some<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.500> these<00:04:24.590> look<00:04:24.830> great<00:04:25.600> no<00:04:26.600> surprise

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
and some of these look great no surprise

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.570 
and some of these look great no surprise
here<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.440> maps<00:04:27.650> always<00:04:27.950> look<00:04:28.100> good<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.430> this

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
here the maps always look good for this

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.460 
here the maps always look good for this
series<00:04:29.000> but<00:04:29.750> I'm<00:04:29.840> just<00:04:30.020> gonna<00:04:30.140> give<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.440> a

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
series but I'm just gonna give you a

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.590 
series but I'm just gonna give you a
quick<00:04:30.770> taste<00:04:31.610> look<00:04:32.450> at<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:34.000> nice<00:04:35.000> shrub<00:04:35.330> land

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
quick taste look at this nice shrub land

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.470 
quick taste look at this nice shrub land
there<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.230> then<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.100> city<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:38.180> know<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.300> take

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
there and then the city you know I take

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.180 
there and then the city you know I take
that<00:04:38.660> back<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:38.930> think<00:04:39.170> they've<00:04:39.440> improved<00:04:39.950> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
that back I think they've improved the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.920 
that back I think they've improved the
map<00:04:40.430> quality<00:04:40.910> I'm<00:04:41.000> looking<00:04:41.240> at<00:04:41.300> this<00:04:41.420> city<00:04:41.720> now

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
map quality I'm looking at this city now

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.950 
map quality I'm looking at this city now
and<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:43.640> know<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.880> printing<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.780> lot

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
and you know the printing is just a lot

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.930 
and you know the printing is just a lot
more<00:04:44.990> vibrant<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.100> almost<00:04:46.370> want<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.790> say

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
more vibrant and I almost want to say

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.850 
more vibrant and I almost want to say
the<00:04:47.060> artworks<00:04:47.420> a<00:04:47.540> little<00:04:47.750> bit<00:04:47.840> different<00:04:48.260> but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the artworks a little bit different but

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
the artworks a little bit different but
maybe<00:04:49.040> I'm<00:04:49.220> just<00:04:49.400> fooling<00:04:49.700> myself<00:04:49.820> now<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:50.540> if

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
maybe I'm just fooling myself now but if

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.080 
maybe I'm just fooling myself now but if
I<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:50.900> zoom<00:04:51.350> out<00:04:52.010> for<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.610> can<00:04:52.760> just<00:04:52.940> see

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
I just zoom out for you you can just see

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.330 
I just zoom out for you you can just see
I<00:04:53.120> mean<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:53.480> looks<00:04:53.690> spectacular<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.280> you

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
I mean it looks spectacular and when you

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.680 
I mean it looks spectacular and when you
get<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.580> counters<00:04:55.940> on<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.120> field

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
get the counters on the field

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.630 
get the counters on the field
look<00:04:56.900> at<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.140> Wow<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:57.950> lot<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.130> rivers<00:04:58.490> to

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
look at that Wow a lot of rivers to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.330 
look at that Wow a lot of rivers to
contend<00:04:58.970> with<00:04:59.030> here<00:04:59.530> okay<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:00.590> there's<00:05:01.040> one

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
contend with here okay so there's one

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.240 
contend with here okay so there's one
two<00:05:01.550> three<00:05:01.580> I<00:05:01.910> believe<00:05:02.390> six<00:05:02.950> separate<00:05:03.950> Maps

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
two three I believe six separate Maps

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.520 
two three I believe six separate Maps
and<00:05:04.730> then<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.540> final<00:05:05.840> thing<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.020> show<00:05:06.290> you<00:05:06.320> is

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
and then the final thing to show you is

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.450 
and then the final thing to show you is
this<00:05:06.890> scenario<00:05:07.370> book<00:05:07.640> which<00:05:08.570> is<00:05:08.780> meaty<00:05:09.460> 48

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
this scenario book which is meaty 48

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.210 
this scenario book which is meaty 48
pages<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:12.620> same<00:05:13.580> paper<00:05:13.850> stock<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.420> course

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
pages and same paper stock of course

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.740 
pages and same paper stock of course
here's<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.310> battles<00:05:16.850> under<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.240> name<00:05:17.390> four

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
here's the battles under the name four

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.310 
here's the battles under the name four
five<00:05:17.960> six

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
five six

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.750 
five six
yes<00:05:19.250> 11<00:05:19.700> battles<00:05:20.890> listed<00:05:21.890> out<00:05:22.010> for<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.400> and

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
yes 11 battles listed out for you and

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.290 
yes 11 battles listed out for you and
then<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.450> can<00:05:23.600> see<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.020> color<00:05:24.590> is<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:26.270> same

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
then you can see the color is the same

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.820 
then you can see the color is the same
as<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.720> rulebook<00:05:26.930> but<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.410> makes<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.680> huge

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
as the rulebook but it makes a huge

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.440 
as the rulebook but it makes a huge
difference<00:05:27.920> I<00:05:28.460> mean<00:05:28.580> even<00:05:28.850> look<00:05:28.970> at<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.210> setup

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
difference I mean even look at the setup

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.830 
difference I mean even look at the setup
very<00:05:30.410> clear<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.860> straightforward<00:05:31.840> what's

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
very clear and straightforward what's

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.950 
very clear and straightforward what's
happening<00:05:33.320> who<00:05:33.470> needs<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.830> go<00:05:33.950> where<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:35.750> zoom

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
happening who needs to go where you zoom

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.630 
happening who needs to go where you zoom
in<00:05:36.110> on<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.440> on<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.040> for<00:05:37.340> you

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
in on you on that for you

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.570 
in on you on that for you
and<00:05:37.960> then<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.350> just<00:05:40.280> wanted<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.640> point<00:05:40.880> out<00:05:42.580> flip

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
and then I just wanted to point out flip

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.570 
and then I just wanted to point out flip
through<00:05:43.850> some<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.330> for<00:05:44.600> you<00:05:45.250> but<00:05:46.250> look<00:05:46.460> at

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
through some of this for you but look at

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.300 
through some of this for you but look at
some<00:05:46.820> of<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.000> counter<00:05:47.590> density<00:05:48.590> on<00:05:48.980> some<00:05:49.220> of

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
some of the counter density on some of
