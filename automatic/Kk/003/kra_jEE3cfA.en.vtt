00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
silver studs and what I decided to do

was<00:00:42.390> paint<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.110> tried<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> couple<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
was paint them I tried a couple of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
was paint them I tried a couple of
different<00:00:44.640> ways<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.969> doing<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> dot

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
different ways of doing that I put a dot

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
different ways of doing that I put a dot
of<00:00:46.350> polish<00:00:46.829> onto<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.280> ziploc<00:00:47.789> bag<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> then

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of polish onto a ziploc bag and then

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.060 
of polish onto a ziploc bag and then
rolled<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> around<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.710> didn't<00:00:50.010> really

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
rolled it around and that didn't really

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.270 
rolled it around and that didn't really
work<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.320> thought<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.920> could<00:00:53.190> get

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
work very well I thought I could get

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
work very well I thought I could get
away<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.820> actually<00:00:54.270> painting<00:00:54.719> each

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
away with not actually painting each

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.590 
away with not actually painting each
stud<00:00:55.379> individually<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.670> turns<00:00:56.910> out<00:00:57.090> that's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
stud individually it turns out that's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.550 
stud individually it turns out that's
not<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.109> case

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.650 

now<00:01:01.220> as<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:01.520> can<00:01:01.610> see<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.790> ended<00:01:02.300> up<00:01:02.390> just

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660

painting<00:01:03.080> them<00:01:03.230> rolling<00:01:03.590> them<00:01:03.830> around<00:01:04.160> in<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
painting them rolling them around in the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.310 
painting them rolling them around in the
dot<00:01:04.880> of<00:01:05.000> polishes<00:01:05.390> was<00:01:05.660> not<00:01:05.900> going<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.140> work
