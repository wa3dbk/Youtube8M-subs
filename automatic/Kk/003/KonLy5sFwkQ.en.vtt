00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
 i 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello my name is JuliÃ¡n Bernal and in 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 this class we will see the microphones 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.740
 are electroacoustic transducers this 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.440
 it means that they are the devices 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.330
 that allow you to convert the sound signal 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.990
 that travels through the air in the form of 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.910
 acoustic energy in electrical energy 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.619
 this is made possible because each 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 microphone has a membrane in its 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.689
 interior that perceives the sound waves 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.930
 that make her vibrate in this way 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.000
 the signal is translated into an electrical flow 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.130
 proportional to the acoustic flow there are three 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.230
 main characteristics that should be 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.910
 Take into account when choosing a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.129
 microphone for recording 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.309
 determined instrument beginning 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.000
 operational directionality and response in 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.100
 frequencies the operating principle is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.230
 refers to two main classes of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.019
 microphones according to the way you translate the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.749
 energy and they are the dynamic ones and the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.050
 Condenser microphones Dynamic 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.880
 they are made up of a diaphragm 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.700
 connected to a voice coil the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.400
 movement that generates the coil causes 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 the electrical impulses is here where 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.350
 produces the translation of the signal 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 acoustics 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 this kind of microphones have a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.159
 good sensitivity that means the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.619
 capacity that microphones have for 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.229
 capture the acoustic signal according to its angle 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.149
 and intensity this kind of microphones 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.420
 can withstand pressure levels 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.549
 very loud for this reason the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.530
 Instruments that are recorded with this type 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 of microphones are instruments that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.299
 generate a high level like for example 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.630
 electric guitars amplifiers 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 bass drum drums drum toms 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.030
 trombones saxophones trumpets with gas 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.520
 among others the microphones of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.429
 capacitor contain inside a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.740
 capsule formed by two plates one of 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.830
 they are fixed and the other is mobile in 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.020
 half of them there is an insulating material 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.479
 the mobile plate is the one that receives the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 sound waves said waves make 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.709
 this plate vibrates approaching or 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 moving away from the fixed plate 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.080
 generating the electric flow so that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.019
 these microphones work is necessary 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 have an external 48 volt source 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.400
 also called phantom power the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 circuit that is in 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.500
 interior of the microphone needs this 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 voltage to activate the design of the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.239
 condenser microphones allows to have 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.970
 greater sensitivity to sources of 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.650
 sound and also a flatter response 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.379
 in the entire range of the different 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.629
 frequencies that make up the signal the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.519
 limitation of these microphones can 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.189
 be at the highest level that the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.079
 capacitor can withstand because of it 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.569
 some of this type of microphones 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.269
 They have attenuators that help reduce 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.250
 the sensitivity if the signal is 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.709
 distorts it must ensure that the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 attenuators are activated for 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.599
 eliminate this problem and protect the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.970
 microphone if the problem persists is 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.519
 best away a little microphone 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.859
 sound source or if it is necessary to change 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.889
 a microphone that resists pressures 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.359
 the higher the instruments that 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.519
 are recorded with microphones 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.069
 capacitor are those that do not have 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.349
 a sound level so high or have a 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.870
 moderate level for a microphone 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.879
 these characteristics as for example 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.280
 the voices string instruments 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.400
 acoustic pianos 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.700
 of battery at a suitable distance 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.160
 clarinets flutes and so on answer 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.990
 often all the microphones are 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 manufactured to respond to a 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.120
 determined frequency range this 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.880
 it is usually illustrated on a graph 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.250
 which indicates the amplitude for each 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.739
 frequency on the x axis is the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.959
 frequency represented in hertz and the 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.540
 answer in decibels is in the y axis 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.700
 these graphs are quite clear and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.070
 practices and you need to know the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.739
 response that is required to record and 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.450
 capture a particular instrument a 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.180
 microphone with an answer of 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.459
 frequency is flat is usually used 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.830
 to capture the pure sound of a 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.109
 instrument without the need to perform 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.019
 some range such is the case of the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.000
 acoustic guitars and the piano is common 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.190
 also that these microphones are used 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.500
 to make a stereo microphone is 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.840
 say with two microphones so 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.690
 capture a whole band or something that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.030
 require this technique on the other hand 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.040
 the microphones that have an answer 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.290
 in non- flat frequencies 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.260
 that at a certain point they have a 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.960
 alteration which may be greater or 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.020
 lower amplitude are special for 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.660
 some kind of instruments an example 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.760
 it can be the microphones used to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.890
 the drum hype these microphones 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.500
 they have an enhancement in the frequencies 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.960
 low to give depth to this 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.420
 instrument the microphones used 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.270
 for voices they also have a highlight 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.510
 between 2 and 10 kilos hertz to give 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.700
 clarity to the captured signal is good 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.340
 clarify that no microphone built 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.440
 to date it has a 100% response 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.540
 flat which means that without 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.360
 import the good or bad of the microphone 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.720
 the recording will always receive a 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.760
 particular coloration directionality the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.310
 directionality of a microphone is the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.530
 capacity and sensitivity that you have for 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.050
 capture a sound source according to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.390
 direction and the angle from where it comes 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.360
 that is, there are microphones that can 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.940
 capture a source in equal magnitude like this 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.250
 this fountain is in front of you 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.010
 or on both sides in any direction 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.830
 other microphones capture most of the 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.020
 sound in the front that back the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.210
 directionality or polar pattern of the 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.990
 microphones is also represented in 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.180
 graphs and shows the sensitivity in 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.550
 360 degrees around the microphone there are 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.550
 various types of polar patterns the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.540
 first of them is the pattern 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.520
 omnidirectional and those are 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.340
 microphones that perceive in the same way 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.100
 by all its addresses the source of 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.460
 sound more than all its use is practical 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.810
 to take environments the pattern 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.210
 unidirectional is more sensitive in 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.060
 certain parts that exist in others 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.460
 several kinds of unidirectional like 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.340
 for example cardio and that has 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.800
 greater sensitivity if the source is at 0 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.830
 degrees of the front of the microphone and minor 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.920
 if the source is at 180 degrees with 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.600
 regarding this same point these 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.580
 microphones are used for 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.580
 instruments that are in the same 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.800
 fourth and they need to be isolated and that a 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.720
 instrument does not dirty the other's signal 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.870
 they are also the most common 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.310
 to record all kinds of instruments 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.860
 pointing them directly to the source 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.620
 Sound 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.469
 the other two employers belonging to 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.259
 the unidirectional class are the super 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.419
 cardio jde and the hyper cardio and that a 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.000
 difference of cardio and have a 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.759
 little more sensitive in the part 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.159
 Rear of the microphone the third pattern 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.680
 It is bidirectional and as its name 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.599
 indica are sensitive microphones in two 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.090
 directions alike for the front and 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.759
 behind they have less sensitivity in 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.550
 the sides are also called figure 8 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.500
 It is practical to use it in sources 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.169
 of sound that are located one 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.449
 in front of another such as a duo 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.449
 of guitars are also used to 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:34.879
 certain type of stereo techniques 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.800
 as you can see there are many 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:39.169
 possibilities when choosing a 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.059
 microphone suitable for certain kind of 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.400
 instruments but you must follow 

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:45.169
 certain parameters and you should have in 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.900
 account the right characteristics 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:50.409
 to have a good pure sound in a 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.409
 recording 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.530
 to really understand the microphones 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.660
 you have to work with them 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.970
 the theory that surrounds them can be a lot 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.220
 more complex than seen in this class 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.250
 nevertheless understand their principles 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.740
 basic is essential to start 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.110
 work with them not only achieve good 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.290
 recordings but to take care of them until 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.290
 then
