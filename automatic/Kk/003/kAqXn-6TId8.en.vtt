00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.480
 good 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.260
 we will test whether this gizmo 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 solve 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.030
 here the problem we had in this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 piece 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 this piece the client had it here 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.950
 embedded thus covering the holes of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 steam outlet 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.210
 and for that reason I was not able to leave 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.950
 steam and it came out here 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.080
 this is the hole where the steam comes from 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 when this is covered but his is 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.030
 that comes out here and for that this piece 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.310
 you can not impose 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.310
 there has to be someone in his place 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.910
 in that site 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.780
 so 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.840
 then this goes over 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.190
 and now as you can see the holes do not 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.190
 they are calculated 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.780
 we can see the interior 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 and that's why it was so or so to 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.870
 client not to go out for we're doing 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.870
 all of spain 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.200
 how this works like a charm 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.800
 As you can see, the steam starts to come out 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.200
 and alak and the pot with the food that 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.450
 it is cooking 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.170
 in this case we are not going to 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.420
 cook it 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 good now for photographers
