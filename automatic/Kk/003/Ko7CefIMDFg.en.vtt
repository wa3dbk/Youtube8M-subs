I<00:00:13.740> play<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.320> yeah<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.680> will<00:00:17.100> try<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.660> I<00:00:18.830> think

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
I play it and yeah I will try it I think

my English is not so good but I hope you
understand<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.590> playing<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> song

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
understand the way I'm playing the song

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.730 
understand the way I'm playing the song
and<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.269> doing<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.869> Tom<00:00:29.510> first

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
and what I'm doing I'm like Tom first

the<00:00:31.740> preset<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> use<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.960> with<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.230> pot<00:00:34.590> extra

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the preset I use is with my pot extra

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.389 
the preset I use is with my pot extra
life<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> AC<00:00:36.630> 30<00:00:37.110> cm<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.860> loop<00:00:41.100> there

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
life it's a AC 30 cm and the loop there

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
life it's a AC 30 cm and the loop there
is<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.620> line<00:00:44.129> six<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> nine<00:00:45.360> stompbox

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is the line six and nine stompbox

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.459 
is the line six and nine stompbox
modeler<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.989> use<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.440> tube<00:00:49.860> compressor

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
modeler and I use the tube compressor

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:59.470 
modeler and I use the tube compressor
for<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:53.550> simulating<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> STD<00:00:55.610> 3000<00:00:57.739> preamp

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
for for simulating the STD 3000 preamp

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.520 
for for simulating the STD 3000 preamp
it's<00:01:00.770> not<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> STD<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it's not way this is the STD we do this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's not way this is the STD we do this
job<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.520> okay<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
job but it's okay for me and I have a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
job but it's okay for me and I have a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
x3 I will clean with my strut and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.260 
x3 I will clean with my strut and
correct<00:01:30.479> position<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:32.549> delay<00:01:32.909> setting

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
correct position and the delay setting

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.060 
correct position and the delay setting
it's<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> dose<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.740> 8

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
it's the dose at 8

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.900 
it's the dose at 8
the<00:01:36.910> mix<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.270> about<00:01:38.200> 40%<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:42.070> only<00:01:42.370> one

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
the mix is about 40% and this only one

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.700 
the mix is about 40% and this only one
repeat<00:01:45.120> it's<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:49.090> analog<00:01:49.570> delay<00:01:50.440> was

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
repeat it's the analog delay was

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
repeat it's the analog delay was
modulation<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.780> speed<00:01:53.230> about<00:01:53.910> 69%<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.780> depth

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
modulation not speed about 69% and depth

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.500 
modulation not speed about 69% and depth
about<00:01:58.260> 20%<00:01:59.260> so<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> way<00:02:02.640> yeah<00:02:03.640> my

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
about 20% so that's the way yeah my

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.450 
about 20% so that's the way yeah my
settings<00:02:04.900> are<00:02:05.460> okay<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:07.030> will<00:02:07.600> begin<00:02:07.990> with<00:02:08.649> the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
settings are okay I will begin with the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.100 
settings are okay I will begin with the
next<00:02:09.880> part<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.380> show<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.120> play<00:02:13.630> or

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
next part and show you how to play or

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.920 
next part and show you how to play or
like<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.070> play<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:16.030> intro<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.980> yeah<00:02:17.980> I'm

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
like I play the intro and yeah I'm

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.990 
like I play the intro and yeah I'm
interested<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.200> your<00:02:20.440> feedbacks<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.220> enjoy
