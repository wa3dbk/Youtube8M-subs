00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.569
 Hi Guys, I wanted to show you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.980
 What does it feel like to be walking around 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.800
 computex 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.049
 so I made this video without showing it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.440
 I've seen a lot of overclocking 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.380
 this is what I see is an overclock that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 there was a video card in the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 galaxy which is a manufacturer of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.210
 video you can see how the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 frozen connectors on the track using 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 liquid hydrogen and each plate has 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 thus forces a container for the faces 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 put the nitrogen 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.930
 I approached them and tried to ask the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.100
 who are doing exactly what they were 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 course 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 we stopped trying to use the loc 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 they are trying to reach out but they were me 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 mate cuzco friends treated me like 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 was an overclocking rainstorm 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 strong carlito genius is genius but the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 what are you trying to do? 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 we are trying to make it happen 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.320
 passes the forest stretch no longer 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.259
 Expensive things have upset me. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.330
 I know if it 's because he was really 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.150
 occupied or because you do not want to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 I'm doing anyway I do not know what it is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.210
 because they can get a little imagistic 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.659
 With me there, asking is about the wake. 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.659
 with them 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.990
 already in another booth the booth of the agency 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.630
 kill that is manufacturer of memories and all 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.190
 year they make a championship of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.400
 overclock you can see the table the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.830
 winners at the moment neither is there a close 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.830
 of the personnel participating in the championship 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.370
 the plasticity 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.880
 the same happened in the auditorium 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.130
 the one that these people talk to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.930
 with me but I think I was guilty - 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.690
 Can you see that I'm doing the championship? 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.260
 is occurring while the other 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.709
 they did not want to be disturbed by 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.709
 answer and female 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.010
 already this other state stand ms are 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.659
 entering the championship the government places 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 Actually, this is the sponsored team. 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.720
 by the others are doing the block and then 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.209
 Until he told you what it was 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.060
 doing and everything else but it was a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.790
 clamor was a woman is interviewing 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.620
 they are thus missing them for 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.599
 public but many people hell the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.879
 som was out a butt i could not 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.579
 I wanted to film until I film but it 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.079
 people in front and was not getting 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.500
 explaining and doing so 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.150
 Bad I did not enjoy it

 This is a personal hug
