00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 i 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.570
 hi guys this adriana villela 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 In this episode of staying in the kitchen, I'm going 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.180
 share with you at my meal 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.780
 mother and gas it is stuffed we go 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.410
 stuff it with them and tomato ready 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.970
 You need wheat for who I have. 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.860
 here a mint plant is delicious 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.330
 I'll use it, you can use it for 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.729
 also the ground meat and something to 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.500
 find that simple come 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.540
 first step people need to measure 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.549
 How much meat do I have? I only did it. 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.070
 this before starting the program and 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.409
 people have two cups of this exactly 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.450
 need not have two daughters too. 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.119
 of wheat to give a balanced and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
 It will keep the pasta very delicious for 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.479
 that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 this guy that doubles in size when 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 people treats 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.549
 I'm going to put a cup of wheat here. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'll put the same measure of water 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:30.429
 I have here a very hot water had 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.159
 Just a little stir here, leave this guy 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.539
 that I'll start preparing the seasoning 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.729
 What I'm going to put on the son. 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.990
 I'll get some sheets 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.859
 referrals you can use mint or 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.999
 mint to spend a win right 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:54.399
 and then I'm going to hit these guys here 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:58.259
 in a small pot of seasoning ready 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.259
 put a little lemon that also 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.200
 I'm going to use last month five minutes. 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.319
 looks like such the wheat completely 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.530
 hydrated 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:16.150
 now I can mix the meat here 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 and it's super temperam that I just 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360
 do 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.569
 and then I'll just move on to 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.830
 to incorporate well to make a well 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.830
 delicious team 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.049
 always experimenting took advantage of salt 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.099
 only a tiny bit of raw meat does not 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.040
 bad to anyone 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.989
 or cut the tomato into the filling 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.940
 I like to cut and fine just like that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:56.980
 But there you go, now you get a 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 way and come back with a little bit of love 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.299
 I'll start putting the dough 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.690
 I'm going to put half that mass I 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:10.430
 I prepared to wait another half, I'm not going 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:14.450
 spread very well by the hour 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.620
 I'll put the tomato slices and the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.620
 slices showed 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.890
 now this top layer that I'm going to give 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.030
 a pass like this before placing 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.020
 here's easier, but magano the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.020
 guys down here 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.400
 now I'll make some marquinhos here 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.070
 it kind of breaks apart 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.670
 time I'm going again in sealing 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.570
 I took the week butter, which is what 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.830
 will do 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.700
 I wish you 're fine for now I'm going 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.320
 take this guy to the oven we take I 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.080
 I think in 20 minutes 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.770
 Thirty minutes or so today in the oven 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.200
 high 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.410
 He is going to roast completely. I'll be right back. 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:21.310
 here to show you how tchan is 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.980
 besides what if you were with me now 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.260
 You smell the boy. 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.550
 leaving the lining and then we go there then come 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.550
 with a single spatula 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.619
 to crack a mint leaf and now 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:50.759
 comes the best time the time that I most 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:50.759
 I like the first one is connected to a certain 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.350
 hum hum 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.760

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.350

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.310
