00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
blunt pencil and then draw a line

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.039 
blunt pencil and then draw a line
guideline<00:01:48.560> again<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.429> down<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:49.849> and<00:01:50.149> then

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
guideline again going down here and then

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.910 
guideline again going down here and then
another<00:01:51.170> one<00:01:51.459> down<00:01:52.459> here<00:01:53.560> okay<00:01:54.560> you're<00:01:54.770> going

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
another one down here okay you're going

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.789 
another one down here okay you're going
to<00:01:54.979> use<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.369> as<00:01:55.580> your<00:01:55.840> guide<00:01:56.840> line<00:01:57.200> again<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
to use that as your guide line again to

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.679 
to use that as your guide line again to
draw<00:01:57.950> your<00:01:58.099> window<00:01:58.399> other<00:01:59.149> way<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.330> draw<00:01:59.539> your

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
draw your window other way to draw your

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.660 
draw your window other way to draw your
window<00:01:59.929> you<00:01:59.990> can<00:02:00.110> either<00:02:00.470> just<00:02:01.130> make<00:02:01.399> a

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
window you can either just make a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.259 
window you can either just make a
rectangle<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.689> do<00:02:05.810> is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.110 

rectangle<00:02:11.269> like<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.760> line<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:13.970> up

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
rectangle like that going to line it up

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.610 
rectangle like that going to line it up
and<00:02:14.360> make<00:02:14.480> sure<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.930> same<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> other

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and make sure it's the same on the other

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.330 
and make sure it's the same on the other
side<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:17.390> guideline<00:02:18.160> should<00:02:19.160> be

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
side and your guideline should be

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.690 
side and your guideline should be
running

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
running

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.660 
running
we<00:02:20.480> will<00:02:20.660> center<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.079> that<00:02:21.260> rectangle<00:02:21.670> that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
we will center of that rectangle that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.250 
we will center of that rectangle that
one's<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.120> quite<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.600> I'll<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.989> train<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
one's not quite as I'll just train a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.729 
one's not quite as I'll just train a
guideline<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.769> bit<00:02:25.600> okay<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:28.060> same<00:02:29.060> thing

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
guideline a bit okay and then same thing

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.309 
guideline a bit okay and then same thing
as<00:02:30.739> we<00:02:31.010> did<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.310> door<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.989> one's<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
as we did on the door and this one's a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.140 
as we did on the door and this one's a
bit<00:02:33.470> sharp<00:02:34.000> let<00:02:35.000> me<00:02:35.090> do<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.329> one<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:35.690> yeah
