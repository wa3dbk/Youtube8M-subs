00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.440
 party certainly very important in the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.660
 everyday life because we think 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.850
 to a first course 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 we are usually used to cooking 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.740
 then later maybe to leave what 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 place it in the fridge once 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.109
 which has cooled down 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.279
 I read with face with us we can 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.260
 to cool our plate quickly 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 and stored in the refrigerator for at least 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.840
 five days 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 then talking about natural cuisine 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.260
 surely we will have a product that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.870
 will retain the initial characteristics 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 visa not really healthy for all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 last five days for our times 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 because I always say if you make a dinner on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.820
 Tuesday when you can cook the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 Monday night because then run 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.590
 quietly until he goes to sleep though 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 you must then be able to keep what you have 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.890
 done without the least hesitation if it is not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.030
 the blast chiller keep food until 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 a day later it is a problem 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.930
 no temperature printer has some 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 innovative features 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.460
 among these, there is low culture 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.780
 slow cooking temperature than in 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.880
 last years in the professional kitchen 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.200
 brought norms results from 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.180
 point of view of the quality of the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.570
 Slow cooking products means 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.700
 practically use the product e 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.649
 cook it for longer at a temperature 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.229
 lower than the classic ones to which 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.509
 for example we are used to the oven at 180 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.130
 degrees we find it a little everywhere with 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.840
 the low temperature culture we say the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.119
 cooking digits then the from 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.770
 temperature itself is reduced 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.840
 cooking times are longer 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 itself therefore if before a rostrum 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.450
 we did in 40 50 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 now the roasts begin to cook 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 even for three or four hours but temperatures 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.020
 significantly lower then for a red 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 for example we can almost 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.909
 quietly at 54 degrees to the heart i 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.649
 advantages of this type of cooking yes 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.450
 they express above all in the fact that they do not 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.910
 there being no evaporation 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.959
 evaporation there is no water loss 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.510
 inside the product 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.890
 we have a much softer vote than 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.540
 preserves within it the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.519
 organoleptic and own characteristics 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.310
 of the product so we will not disperse in the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.049
 oven minerals but mineral salts them 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.290
 we will keep within the product six 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:31.290
 you yes then juiciness 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.140
 providence of the house certainly in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.260
 act in the kitchen a big change e 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 the kitchen the kitchen furniture follows 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.180
 the evolution with the evolution of the three m 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.400
 c this in my opinion is a 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.040
 so new appliance 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.620
 generation that we will not be able in the future 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.959
 to do without it and that's right at the level 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.060
 domestic will increasingly take us 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.790
 as models the great certain great 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.920
 professionals clearly using the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.980
 appliances equipment 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.959
 maybe small but still 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.470
 that have the same characteristics and the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.470
 same prerogatives
