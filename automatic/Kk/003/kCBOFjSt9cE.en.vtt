00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.470

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.649
 styles that have good 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 where we have to say in the 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.850
 body be freestyle so they are good 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.740
 and they are all incredible ideas 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.220
 as all the geography of known is 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.190

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.140

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.170
 place in organization for all 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.909
 dear holidays all the conditions 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.890
 of violet and now I have to go to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.640
 change quick fast fast because the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 past people 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.119
 million times and even more now 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.570
 I like it a lot because quite 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.340
 interpreted is with suitcases or suitcases and 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.130
 let's make movements with the body 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.770
 and the suitcase and that and all together and I say 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.870
 the truth I am not a dancer and thanks to 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.740
 because I am more singer but now 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.740

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.049
 that song I really enjoyed recording it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.269
 and the video clip I think it's going to be a 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.310
 crazy too so they will see what 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.310
