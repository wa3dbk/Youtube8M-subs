a<00:00:05.520> lot<00:00:05.640> easier<00:00:05.790> than<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.180> sounds

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
a lot easier than it sounds

traps<00:00:09.360> before<00:00:09.630> round<00:00:10.230> ten<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.219> including<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
traps before round ten and including a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.640 
traps before round ten and including a
upgrade<00:00:12.570> there's<00:00:13.019> only<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.320> trap<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
upgrade there's only one trap you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.140

upgrade though and there's only a total
of<00:00:15.240> three<00:00:15.420> traps<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:16.379> too<00:00:16.590> difficult<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
of three traps so not too difficult the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
of three traps so not too difficult the
very<00:00:17.940> first<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.080> behind<00:00:19.380> me<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
quick before we move on to the second

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.389 
quick before we move on to the second
trap<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.170> love<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> way<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> mystery

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
trap I love the way that the the mystery

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
trap I love the way that the the mystery
box<00:00:38.520> looks<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.059> crazy<00:00:39.270> yeah<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.079> LSAT

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
can't complain about that alright now

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
can't complain about that alright now
I'm<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.390> ahead<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> hightail<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
I'm going to go ahead and hightail it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.889 
I'm going to go ahead and hightail it
over<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.010> second<00:00:44.489> trap<00:00:44.670> spot<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> these

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
over to the second trap spot and these

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.420 
over to the second trap spot and these
two<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:46.440> easy<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> last

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
two are pretty easy to get to the last

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
two are pretty easy to get to the last
one<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> definitely<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> most<00:00:48.390> confusing<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
one is definitely the most confusing and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
one is definitely the most confusing and
it's<00:00:49.890> probably<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> lot<00:00:50.550> easier<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> had

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it's probably a lot easier if you had

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
it's probably a lot easier if you had
multiple<00:00:51.719> people<00:00:52.170> helping<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.730> then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
multiple people helping but but then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.010 
multiple people helping but but then
again<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> have

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
again I don't know if you have to have

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
again I don't know if you have to have
individually<00:00:55.620> people<00:00:55.920> pull<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> traps<00:00:57.149> every

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
individually people pull the traps every

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
individually people pull the traps every
single<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.379> solo<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> did

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
single time so solo is the way I did

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
single time so solo is the way I did
this<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.510> definitely<00:01:00.960> worked<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this it definitely worked this way and I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
this it definitely worked this way and I
mean<00:01:02.460> round<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> first<00:01:03.899> trap<00:01:04.229> or

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
mean round one I got the first trap or

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
mean round one I got the first trap or
round<00:01:04.739> two<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> guess<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> second

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
round two I guess and then the second

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
round two I guess and then the second
trap<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.950> follow<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.369> way

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
trap is if if you just follow this way

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
trap is if if you just follow this way
that<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> went<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.159> a
