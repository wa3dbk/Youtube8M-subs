00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
brakes you want to put a brand new rotor

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.360 
brakes you want to put a brand new rotor
on<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.910> pads<00:00:09.660> obviously<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.070> setup

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
on and pads obviously so with this setup

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
on and pads obviously so with this setup
in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> 2006<00:00:12.349> f150<00:00:14.480> we<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.960> remove<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
in the 2006 f150 we have to remove the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.429 
in the 2006 f150 we have to remove the
caliper<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> then<00:00:17.850> remove<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.140> bracket

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
caliper and then remove this bracket

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.679 
caliper and then remove this bracket
here<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.550> holds<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.910> pads<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:21.600> we

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
here that holds the pads and then we

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
here that holds the pads and then we
could<00:00:21.840> pull<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.710> rotor<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.490> started

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
could pull the rotor out to get started

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
could pull the rotor out to get started
there's<00:00:24.660> two<00:00:24.869> bolts<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.439> hold<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> caliper

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there's two bolts that hold the caliper

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.700 
there's two bolts that hold the caliper
on<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.640> these<00:00:26.789> slide<00:00:27.029> pins<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.930> 13<00:00:28.289> mil<00:00:28.500> one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
on on these slide pins it's 13 mil one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.020 
on on these slide pins it's 13 mil one
there<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.869> then<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.160> pull

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
there and then one right down there pull

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:46.050
