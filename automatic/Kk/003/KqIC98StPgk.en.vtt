tremendous genetic and athletic

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.030 
tremendous genetic and athletic
potential<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.620> kind<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:05.890> had<00:02:06.010> to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
potential but we kind of had to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.270 
potential but we kind of had to
fine-tune<00:02:06.910> all<00:02:07.450> those<00:02:07.840> minor<00:02:08.170> details<00:02:08.320> but<00:02:09.250> i

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
fine-tune all those minor details but i

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280 
fine-tune all those minor details but i
think<00:02:09.730> that<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.030> ability<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.720> move<00:02:10.869> quickly
