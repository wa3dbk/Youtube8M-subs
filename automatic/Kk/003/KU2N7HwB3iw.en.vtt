let me do one thing at a time I'm gonna
just<00:00:06.340> that<00:00:08.250> acrylic<00:00:09.250> to<00:00:09.639> angle<00:00:09.970> it<00:00:10.000> off<00:00:10.179> that

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
just that acrylic to angle it off that

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.660 
just that acrylic to angle it off that
key<00:00:10.630> nice<00:00:10.840> exactly<00:00:11.530> and<00:00:11.950> we'll<00:00:12.070> try<00:00:12.280> that<00:00:12.460> back

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
key nice exactly and we'll try that back

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.670 
key nice exactly and we'll try that back
in<00:00:12.940> because<00:00:13.269> this<00:00:13.540> really<00:00:13.780> was<00:00:14.019> this<00:00:14.440> was

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
in because this really was this was

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.730 
in because this really was this was
holding<00:00:15.130> it<00:00:15.280> up<00:00:15.400> yeah<00:00:16.059> we'll<00:00:17.050> try<00:00:17.260> that<00:00:17.380> back

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
holding it up yeah we'll try that back

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.009 
holding it up yeah we'll try that back
in<00:00:17.980> here<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.670> since<00:00:18.939> we<00:00:19.029> want<00:00:19.179> to<00:00:19.300> rotate<00:00:19.570> the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
in here and since we want to rotate the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.310 
in here and since we want to rotate the
tooth<00:00:20.339> we<00:00:21.339> want<00:00:21.579> to<00:00:21.699> get<00:00:21.849> rid<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.230> pretty<00:00:23.230> much

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
thing at the lowers mm-hmm looks real

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.880 
thing at the lowers mm-hmm looks real
nice<00:01:34.700> just<00:01:34.910> tweaking<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.450> little<00:01:35.780> bit<00:01:35.990> she<00:01:36.800> has

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
one that just needs to be rotated a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.940 
one that just needs to be rotated a
little<00:01:38.420> bit<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.170> sort<00:01:39.440> of<00:01:39.500> did<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.740> same

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.500 
little bit so I sort of did the same
thing<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.160> added<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.490> little<00:01:40.610> bit<00:01:40.730> of<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
thing I added a little bit of just a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.530 
thing I added a little bit of just a
little<00:01:41.540> bit<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.930> cold<00:01:42.440> pure<00:01:42.680> acrylic<00:01:43.130> I'm

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
little bit of a cold pure acrylic I'm

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.180 
little bit of a cold pure acrylic I'm
party<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.600> lot<00:01:44.690> pushed<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.260> more<00:01:45.500> right

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
party a lot pushed in more right

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.800 
party a lot pushed in more right
so<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.430> told<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.730> just<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:46.910> try<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> rotate<00:01:47.510> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
so I told you just to try to rotate that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.750 
so I told you just to try to rotate that
out<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.110> really<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:49.310> know<00:01:49.490> while<00:01:49.670> you

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
out and I really the you know while you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.850 
out and I really the you know while you
got<00:01:49.880> acrylic<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.450> outside<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.410> labial

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
got acrylic on the outside of it labial

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.800 
got acrylic on the outside of it labial
arch<00:01:52.160> wire<00:01:52.430> yes<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.060> relieved<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.540> little<00:01:53.630> bit

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
arch wire yes so I relieved a little bit

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.150 
arch wire yes so I relieved a little bit
in<00:01:53.870> that<00:01:53.990> spot<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.440> figured<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.740> can<00:01:54.800> push<00:01:55.130> it

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
in that spot so I figured I can push it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.540 
in that spot so I figured I can push it
that<00:01:55.520> way<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:57.050> know<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.170> get<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.340> turn

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
that way you know just get that the turn

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.710 
that way you know just get that the turn
a<00:01:58.580> little<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.880> well<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.210> just<00:01:59.270> simple

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
a little bit well it's just simple

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800 
a little bit well it's just simple
mechanics<00:02:00.200> yeah<00:02:00.380> yeah<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:02.360> otherwise<00:02:02.750> you

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
mechanics yeah yeah so otherwise you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.810 
mechanics yeah yeah so otherwise you
know<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:03.380> good<00:02:03.470> move<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.890> quickly<00:02:04.490> she's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
know that but good move it quickly she's

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.870 
know that but good move it quickly she's
