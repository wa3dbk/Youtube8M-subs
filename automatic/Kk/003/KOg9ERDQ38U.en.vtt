yeah the company that makes this kind to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
yeah the company that makes this kind to
a<00:00:55.800> 5<00:00:56.129> feet<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> pipe<00:00:56.820> without<00:00:57.090> us<00:01:01.969> with<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> 5

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a 5 feet of pipe without us with a 5

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.550 
a 5 feet of pipe without us with a 5
meter<00:01:03.570> type<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.339> could<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.549> airborne<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:07.409> would

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
meter type I could get airborne it would

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
meter type I could get airborne it would
be<00:01:07.680> powerful<00:01:08.549> enough<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.030> lift<00:01:09.450> me

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
be powerful enough to actually lift me

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.350 
be powerful enough to actually lift me
off<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.990> ground<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.580> that<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.210> guys

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
off the ground is that what the the guys

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
off the ground is that what the the guys
at<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.600> beach<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:13.229> using<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> larger<00:01:14.100> ones

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
at the beach are using the larger ones

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
at the beach are using the larger ones
so<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.580> jump<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> waves<00:01:15.299> yeah<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.409> now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so they can jump the waves yeah well now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.460 
so they can jump the waves yeah well now
that's<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.460> they're<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> water<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that's if they're out in the water on a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's if they're out in the water on a
board<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.540> kite

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
board right that's a different kite

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460 
board right that's a different kite
still<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.470> has<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.170> those

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
still that has like a you know those

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
still that has like a you know those
rubber<00:01:25.799> tubes<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> pool<00:01:27.869> with

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
rubber tubes to take into a pool with

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.140 
rubber tubes to take into a pool with
you<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.530> made<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> styrofoam<00:01:29.150> yep

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you that are made out of styrofoam yep

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.249 
you that are made out of styrofoam yep
leading<00:01:30.990> edge<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.970> those<00:01:32.970> kites<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.570> made<00:01:34.110> out

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
leading edge on those kites are made out

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.429 
leading edge on those kites are made out
of<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.860> styrofoam<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.930> stuff<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of that kind of styrofoam to be stuff so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.530 
of that kind of styrofoam to be stuff so
that<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> kite<00:01:37.860> won't<00:01:38.009> sink<00:01:38.430> ok<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.329> made

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that the kite won't sink ok so it's made

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
that the kite won't sink ok so it's made
kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.200> water<00:01:40.409> come<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.950> yet<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
kind of for water come as yet but you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
kind of for water come as yet but you
can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.259> having<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can see I'm just I'm having a lot of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.060 
can see I'm just I'm having a lot of
trouble<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.460> keeping<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.439> guy<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
trouble just keeping this guy up in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.749 
trouble just keeping this guy up in the
air<00:01:47.479> now<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> size<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> kite<00:01:49.409> help<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
air now as the size of the kite help and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.940 
air now as the size of the kite help and
low<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> meal<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.869> low<00:01:52.049> winds<00:01:52.290> bigger<00:01:52.649> kite

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
low a meal is at low winds bigger kite

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.109 
low a meal is at low winds bigger kite
or<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> doesn't<00:01:53.549> matter<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
or is it doesn't matter is there a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.440 
or is it doesn't matter is there a
minimum<00:01:54.450> wind<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.140> were<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> bigger<00:01:55.619> pipe<00:01:56.450> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
minimum wind if it were a bigger pipe it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.880 
minimum wind if it were a bigger pipe it
would<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.960> surface<00:01:58.170> area<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> I'd

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
would have more surface area and I'd

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
would have more surface area and I'd
have<00:01:59.070> better<00:01:59.310> luck<00:01:59.369> getting<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
have better luck getting it up in the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.649 
have better luck getting it up in the
air<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.210> I've<00:02:03.329> never

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
air but I don't know because I've never

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.510 
air but I don't know because I've never
flown<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> larger<00:02:04.619> kite<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
flown a larger kite I just got this a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160 
flown a larger kite I just got this a
couple<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> months<00:02:06.180> ago<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.540> North<00:02:06.840> Carolina

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
couple of months ago in North Carolina

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.059 
couple of months ago in North Carolina
and<00:02:08.729> launched<00:02:09.729> one<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.090> these<00:02:10.209> by<00:02:10.420> yourself

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and launched one of these by yourself

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.690 
and launched one of these by yourself
the<00:02:12.069> easiest<00:02:12.430> way<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.730> do<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
the easiest way to do it is to put a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.050 
the easiest way to do it is to put a
couple<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.150> weights<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> trailing<00:02:17.050> edge

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
couple of weights on the trailing edge

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.580 
couple of weights on the trailing edge
and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.599> wait<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.140> breeze<00:02:20.380> to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
and then you just wait for the breeze to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.790 
and then you just wait for the breeze to
pick<00:02:20.800> up<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.630> pull<00:02:22.930> back<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.440> flight

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
pick up and you pull back on the flight

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.880 
pick up and you pull back on the flight
lines<00:02:24.069> here<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.870> lifts<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> leading<00:02:26.709> edge

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
lines here and it lifts the leading edge

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.500 
lines here and it lifts the leading edge
up<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.340> then<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.550> fills<00:02:27.790> with<00:02:28.000> wind<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.390> it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
up and then it fills with wind and it

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
up and then it fills with wind and it
just<00:02:28.720> goes<00:02:28.900> straight<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.280> air<00:02:30.400> but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
just goes straight up in the air but

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.630 
just goes straight up in the air but
like<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.630> say<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:32.050> not<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.920> winds<00:02:33.130> not<00:02:33.370> really

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
like I say I'm not the winds not really

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.070 
like I say I'm not the winds not really
strong<00:02:33.880> enough<00:02:33.940> today<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:37.450> been<00:02:37.660> out<00:02:37.810> here

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
strong enough today I have been out here

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.699 
strong enough today I have been out here
on<00:02:38.290> days<00:02:38.530> when<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.239> windy<00:02:40.239> enough<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.780> pull

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
on days when it was windy enough to pull
