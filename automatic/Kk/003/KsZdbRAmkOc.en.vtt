00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 ok well this will prepare 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.570
 the densifies concrete door that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.300
 It is also hardener is a liquid 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.780
 similar to water 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.240
 with an approximate yield of 5 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.570
 liters 5 square meters per liter 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.570
 sorry 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.270
 we are going to put it in the sprinkler 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.220
 about three-quarters of the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.750
 people are using about three hours 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.750
 for acids of rough use 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.640
 with these parts we carry 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.000
 although we're almost going to take almost 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.760
 this stretch here that are like 60 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.579
 square meters 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.269
 we are going to take a bucket of 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.200
 identifier we harden the goal of 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:13.299
 this once we polish with with the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.299
 winner and what 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.020
 we choose with sandpaper 120 nations that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.490
 remember in the other video that we choose 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.939
 with this machine 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.810
 this machine with sandpaper 120 we use it 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:32.610
 prior to prior to using the indicator 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 with the goal of this child that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.060
 when the goal 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 clean the whole area as we see there are already 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.560
 pieces that are drying up 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.260
 and we are applying 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.260
 in the whole area 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:59.759
 hardener identifier that I call 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.579
 to the identifier because the layer hardens 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.640
 surface of the right one is super 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.340
 simple the application as we see is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.670
 nothing more to throw a kind of water 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.090
 to our very clean concrete and with the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.090
 open forum 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.050
 in this child 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.050
 ryan before 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.020
 we keep changing 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 and applying the ratio of 5 meters 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.750
 square per liter 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 this is when the people that is the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.280
 most efficient way to apply it 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.190
 You can also apply directly 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.460
 throwing him with a cup and with a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.460
 squeegee 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.770
 and we are applying it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.819
 ok and as we already see we have parts with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.819
 the sun is already there in the background 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.930
 they are starting to dry, we have to 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.650
 give it a slight 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 this 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:23.560
 you have to give it a slight stir can 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:27.170
 call like that with broom let's see let's go 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.580
 to use a broom or the thong 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.720
 let's use a step in this case 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.720
 48 inches 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.110
 finish 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.110
 we are going to 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.110
 move it 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.110
 slightly 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.300
 well to try to penetrate a bit 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.300
 more to give 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.420
 okay 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.130
 It is given when the broom 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.670
 and try not to dry 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.280
 we are not giving them the broom 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.280
 and with the sprinkler 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.150
 although a small one removed so that 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.300
 try with the intention that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.620
 penetrate 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.570
 with the intention of penetrating 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.020
 a little more the densifier in the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.020
 concrete 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.449
 we already come back also throwing him 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.889
 well with this we are going to finish the part 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:49.389
 1 of the densified we are going to let you 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.280
 I worked a half hour ok let's leave 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.280
 be working this entire process 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.729
 it will not take more than an hour 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.990
 we are going to leave him working 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.960
 half an hour 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.960
 ok well let's stop this part
