00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
so the goodies today is a EMC generator
that<00:01:03.030> generates<00:01:03.089> about<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.170> dime<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.830> second

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that generates about a dime in a second

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.719 
that generates about a dime in a second
it<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.060> crazy<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.259> does<00:01:07.500> cause<00:01:08.009> if<00:01:08.520> you

very<00:03:33.769> crucial

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:36.759 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:41.110 

so<00:03:37.759> put<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.090> right<00:03:38.449> there<00:03:38.479> chest<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:40.579> you

so put that right there chest and you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.839 
so put that right there chest and you
start<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.750> black<00:03:42.139> hole<00:03:42.319> band<00:03:42.500> first<00:03:42.949> right

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
start the black hole band first right

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.089 
start the black hole band first right
click<00:03:43.879> it<00:03:44.299> insert<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.199> hog<00:03:45.349> harvest<00:03:45.919> got<00:03:46.069> a

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
click it insert the hog harvest got a

click it insert the hog harvest got a
span<00:03:46.400> next<00:03:47.359> don't<00:03:48.349> do<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:49.509> this<00:03:50.509> is<00:03:50.569> okay

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
span next don't do that this is okay

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.740 
span next don't do that this is okay
it's<00:03:51.349> not<00:03:51.500> messed<00:03:51.829> up<00:03:52.009> or<00:03:52.250> anything

it's not messed up or anything
um<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:54.229> MC<00:03:55.189> generator<00:03:55.790> utilizes<00:03:56.509> a<00:03:56.540> glitch

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
um this MC generator utilizes a glitch

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.990 
um this MC generator utilizes a glitch
where<00:03:57.949> the<00:03:57.979> harvest<00:03:58.579> got<00:03:58.699> us<00:03:58.790> banned

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
where the harvest got us banned

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.890 
where the harvest got us banned
instantly<00:03:59.959> hard<00:04:00.199> grows<00:04:00.979> and<00:04:01.219> harvests

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
instantly hard grows and harvests

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.809 
instantly hard grows and harvests
sugarcane<00:04:02.900> because<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.799> thinks<00:04:04.069> it's<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.430> full

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
sugarcane because it thinks it's a full

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.399 
sugarcane because it thinks it's a full
grown<00:04:06.609> whatever<00:04:07.609> that<00:04:07.909> is<00:04:08.090> called<00:04:08.419> cuz

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
grown whatever that is called cuz

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.719 
grown whatever that is called cuz
there's<00:04:09.620> one<00:04:09.889> on<00:04:10.009> top<00:04:10.189> and<00:04:10.250> one<00:04:10.489> on<00:04:10.609> bottom

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
there's one on top and one on bottom

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.110 
there's one on top and one on bottom
it's<00:04:11.150> five<00:04:11.389> high<00:04:12.069> so<00:04:13.069> if<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:13.729> look<00:04:13.909> in<00:04:14.060> the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
it's five high so if you look in the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.599 
it's five high so if you look in the
chest<00:04:14.389> you<00:04:14.719> will<00:04:14.930> see<00:04:15.169> we<00:04:15.469> already<00:04:15.590> have<00:04:15.889> one

dark matter and seven diamonds that is

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.279 
dark matter and seven diamonds that is
great<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:20.900> about<00:04:21.139> if<00:04:21.949> you<00:04:22.099> look<00:04:22.250> at<00:04:22.430> it

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
it's about a time in a second actually

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.719 
it's about a time in a second actually
in<00:04:27.530> fact<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:28.009> a<00:04:28.039> time<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> second<00:04:29.169> um<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:31.580> yes
