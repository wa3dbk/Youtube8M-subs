00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.000
 and good hello to all 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.010
 x expo phone 04 we find ourselves for a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.190
 any new video on gta 5 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.370
 this time it's how to create a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.490
 clash in the air or a race 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.550
 so first go to the created editor 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.539
 a clash a race it depends 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 clashes what the introduction will be 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.170
 nothing then well you put the little 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.880
 the description the photo type 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 of confrontation then placed the area 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 Activated activation do the trick but 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.129
 laura for example created you go 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.540
 in the decor elements and to make 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.190
 climb up it works best 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.039
 you can try with the rest but 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 the best it works is with the 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.070
 and prefabricated 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.739
 so you go in place is a lure 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.100
 for example beside you go up to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.690
 another you will rapineer on the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.129
 button on xbox and on ps3 cross for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 press on it and then there will be a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.510
 little bug and you can place it at 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 above 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.450
 and then after you can remove those 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 from below it will not change anything 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 so here I take it off and then we 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.570
 can continue and create a clash 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.189
 or even a run in the air for the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 court is the same I will show you 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.500
 with them so the ramps 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.140
 so here we are going to take the big 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.049
 wings we'll put a ramp here that's it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.189
 then for them to stand together makes them 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.460
 little one on the other 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.759
 you go in box and crates and you 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.399
 select pile of floats then 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.079
 you place them to what they are good 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.079
 aligned with the ramp 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.630
 that's more or less ever it works 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.399
 I would not put it better for 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 select the large ramp or 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.420
 no matter how big it is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 the state of floats but for others 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.610
 small and medium must see 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.330
 with the height of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 then you do like the clash 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.360
 the prefabricated as in the other you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 put right away that's where you can 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.230
 to do that until in the sky 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 but then you can remove the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 small the small and small crates and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.569
 all underneath that you can remove 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 that's not going to bother the rent is not going 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.260
 not fall like that could make a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 back to the sky like 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.480
 I had already seen a race like this 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.920
 who has up to the sky salary at 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.519
 port of 110 shore good let's go ben I'm going 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.720
 leave you on this little tutorial how 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.030
 make a clash in the air 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.880
 I hope that you hopefully that 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.880
 you will be pleased at the next ciao
