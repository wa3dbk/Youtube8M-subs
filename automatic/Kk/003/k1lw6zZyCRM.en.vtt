 Juan at home to start the web 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.340
 compadre so today we are going to review 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 20 years of playstation met the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.479
 first two decades of the existence of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.330
 what I feel to be a console more 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.690
 powerful I think the most powerful of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 generation felt 64 bits pulled out 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.670
 as forwards the graph and that was 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 they evolve over time and made it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.799
 be competing in the kings of the world is 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.440
 violate nintendo and also the subject of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.560
 the maturity of some games maybe the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.160
 variety of genres the playstation was 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.959
 completely revolutionary 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.959
 [Music] 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.149
 the if the console had great emphasis on 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.159
 decade of the 90s because as you can see 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.009
 here one of my favorite games a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.869
 castlevania was not only a game for 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.709
 children but also for all kinds of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.819
 public that made the console itself 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.549
 will mark a before and after the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.310
 videogames since the 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.019
 public in general then in this 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.599
 first part of the anniversary of 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.400
 playstation we leave it with the origins 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.700
 of the console in the market of the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.700
 video game 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.739
 [Music] 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 ah 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.040
 everything started at the beginning of the decade 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.519
 of the 90s when nintendo wanted to enter 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.680
 to the multimedia era of consoles and 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.260
 that interest of the optical format was who 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.900
 tried approached several companies in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.790
 serious are and look at the new formats 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.829
 decided rooms that the roms went out as 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.210
 Music audio format appears in 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.000
 the 80s already massively 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.440
 there was all this comment that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.600
 also the irises could be used in a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.230
 digital obviously to store 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.830
 information in console in intel pc we 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.560
 approached action to be able to create a 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.290
 civil multimedia format so that you 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.540
 will create a player I decided for the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.650
 games thus reaching an agreement between 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.990
 sony nintendo an alliance that they wanted 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.330
 carry out an expansion for the 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.250
 super nintendo would like to turn into a 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.030
 cinema a platform without like I know that 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.400
 so I need you, I remember that here 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.720
 in Chile if you knew it was coming 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.530
 appeared magazine that an attempt I think 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.530
 that number 6 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.230
 what happened to this was there a clause 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.360
 between media that said that when manufacturing 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.280
 sounds games for the format 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.700
 nintendo multimedia 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.050
 the president and the maximum boss of 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.950
 interest 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.989
 it's called h 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.599
 saw the contract with tony he realized 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.220
 that much of the collection that already have 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.190
 project was going to fall only at the hands of 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.160
 stony and that in fact this was not going to have 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.170
 the power to make their games and that 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.310
 it's probably about that being able to go out games 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.160
 that they are and with the franchises of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.130
 nintendo de mario etcetera which a 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.459
 Nintendo did not seem right at all 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.229
 finalizing all agreement with sony 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.139
 a boy calls all all the reins of 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.250
 that contract and on the set itself in that 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.370
 then the president of nintendo 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.770
 jaguar lincoln in techno america and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 He commented that they no longer had a 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.930
 agreement with him but he had an agreement 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.940
 with philips and that's when everything was not 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
 he learned of this tradition obviously he 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.840
 had gone to the greatest competition that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.160
 I had, I was back then, what were the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.660
 two companies that fight for the format 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.520
 of decided we're going so I think that at 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.960
 end of accounts then to improve for 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.430
 the best thing that could happen to him 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.100
 industry because entering also had 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.900
 a monopoly 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.300
 it is impossible to continue maintaining and 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.190
 holding with time though I keep 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 with the opinion that I like to know what 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.280
 would have happened if nintendo when alone 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.780
 they tell us to separate 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:09.170
 [Music] 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.170
