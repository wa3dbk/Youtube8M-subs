00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.610
 submarine 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.610
 as it is packed unfortunately with one hand 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.100

 completely ready to use very 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.440
 An interesting thing formalin looks like this 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.709
 so here is this 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.890

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:52.900
 set and and elevators to 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:58.630
 demonstrate how they look here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.330
 such it is from the inside as you can 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:06.000
 watch the first video unfortunately u 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:09.000
 I was shown how she sinks 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 bathroom 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:25.590
 It looks like this on it 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.710
 There was a standard screw, I changed it to 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.570
 optional 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.490
 it can be seen right now dangerous 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.820
 optional screw it is purchased 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.820
 separately 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:47.140
 it is purchased separately 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:53.800
 since it doesn't come with this one 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:58.090
 another country and now I will take off the front 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:06.600
 cover and you can see how it 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:14.710
 looks inside is shot on very easy 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:20.380
 she looks like this 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:28.140
 the inside of the boat 6 bolts and their 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:32.440
 you unscrew the charge 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.950
 in the middle of the fuse without a boat 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.260
 does not turn on and will not start from above as 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:44.050
 can watch 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:47.350
 there is a bolt and it is removed on it instead 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.820
 can not be installed optional camera 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.170
 I mean, instead of a bolt, a system is put 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.680
 for camera 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:00.730
 it is set here even here 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:05.610
 You can see two holes in which 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.610
 where will the camera be installed 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.900
 for now it's all thanks for watching 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.400

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:29.830

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.830
