00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello to all small video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 mike reptiles here is a small video 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.280
 to introduce you almées boa 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.280
 constrictor a little bit so that's it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 here we go 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.879
 So here yours so here is a 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:48.519
 specimen of just under two years 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.940
 so that goes a little beyond the gods m so 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.989
 this is a snake we will say enough 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.879
 pretty docile enough easily 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.229
 manipulable though quite aggressive to 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.479
 the juvenile state that's for sure 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.760
 beware the godfathers of spheres of 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.979
 to get caught see biting feet of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.289
 little whimps when he is when 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.569
 he's young but he's a snake 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.280
 my faith is pleasant enough since it is 

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:16.240
 easily manipulated once the state 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.340
 of course if you've gotten used to the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.080
 handling 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.409
 so it's a snake coming 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.140
 mainly from south america that 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.140
 we find in that starting from mexico 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.369
 until argentine 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.319
 it's a snake that adulthood can 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:40.060
 to arrive between 2 and 3 m for a maximum 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:44.859
 years in employment of 25 kg really big 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.049
 maximum with a lifetime of 2 15 to 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.530
 20 years old maxim maksimov so that's enough 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.390
 sturdy and keep life maaf tender 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.179
 instant easily to go to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.429
 the goal in my opinion he feels good he 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.719
 is filmed and want to ask it so 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.679
 when you see it's an animal that is 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.270
 little aggressive which is my faith enough 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.750
 sturdy since the keep it takes a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.060
 famous presses on me nothing 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.580
 with the lower body he gets to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.310
 to jump easily so that's when 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.850
 even a sturdy animal we will say that I 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 would not recommend to beginners seen his 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.160
 size but that comparatively some 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:30.240
 others and he says for for beginner can 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.490
 be easily manageable since it is 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.280
 easily manipulated is not 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.080
 aggressive so that is with respect 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.150
 food but good here as and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.510
 as it grows should have 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.050
 a proper diet so we're going 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 start in the juvenile state by departure 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.250
 little mice because that's when 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.200
 even a snake coming out of the sea 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.660
 since this one is ovoviviparous it is 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.209
 to say that she does not pump the female does not 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 can not eyes are not two there 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.670
 no worries the incubation for the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.260
 for the breeder she a cube herself 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.200
 them and in his body and we give 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 birth to indes and juvenile everything to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.030
 able to live properly alone 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.080
 and to feed so that's the layer in 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.880
 somehow we will say it's an animal 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.760
 good bath at the storied vinyl as I come 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.380
 to say that he will eat mice already and 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.430
 then we move we will move to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.830
 larger mouse 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.320
 and to finish with rats and who can 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.340
 once had to easily eat rabbits 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.290
 for once we come to a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.730
 certain amount good or even some 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 size even rabbits or even 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.130
 several rabbits one or two eggs rabbits 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.170
 have closely spaced 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.810
 britt had so we can not get to 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.030
 messages to the week we arrive at dd 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.650
 feeding all the cases I see you 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.220
 here moves a lot is a certain strong 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.370
 curious so it's a snake to say 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.530
 easy to handle yes now the one who 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.820
 has several but that's going to count 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.680
 still money at the level of 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.670
 different charges for feeding the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680
 maintenance etc 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.360
 must still provide a vast 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.140
 terrarium since it's a snake that 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.970
 does not catch a size anyway 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.070
 thus imposing must leave her 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.160
 opportunities to move etc 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.620
 to 30 his animal in the best 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.390
 possible conditions with a source of 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.640
 heat so we come to a hot spot 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.910
 good for me that varies between 30 and 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.370
 32 degrees to hot spots and if we 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.730
 guard is a constant from 26 to 27 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.380
 degrees to the cold point this during the 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.860
 day now for the night we're going 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.480
 try to maintain a temperature 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.270
 account I have here I'm holding everything 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.030
 deserved the 24th what I principle more 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.500
 my time heating up was to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.900
 rents independently he is in the process 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.730
 to fuck the bazaar heat the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.220
 terrariums regardless of the game heaters 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.860
 I heat the breeding room 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.790
 so we get to 24 degrees at night 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.940
 quite correct with a percentage 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.340
 hygrometry that occurs between 70 and 80 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.230
 I show myself before entering in two 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.360
 for sordid hygrometry during the 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.790
 moulting period to say to have some 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.800
 walls to have migraines in one 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.810
 piece and that it becomes because we 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.750
 is this complicated good if not in 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.760
 the whole thing is an animal that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.620
 personally I really appreciate a 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.600
 reptile that I appreciate a lot 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.820
 compared to others 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.250
 to other varieties of genius snakes 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.240
 since he has a size like an imposing 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.520
 but my faith manageable for the person who 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.150
 is used to this kind of this kind of 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.610
 specimen and the disconcerting ease 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.500
 with which he finally comes alive father but 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.410
 there is to worry less 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.150
 since it feeds easily it is 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.500
 not like some could have just fallen 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.840
 do not mind bad for the piton 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.570
 region once it is well accustomed 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.310
 it's a snake that will eat well 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.370
 to eat properly too but there is 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.560
 no risk really a priori of 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.400
 anorexia with constrictor wood 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.190
 besides other problem so the parameters 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.780
 of maintenance kept permanently 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:25.090
 well properly maintained 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:28.040
 so also number here it is a snake 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.010
 a snake quite interesting good 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:37.250
 his morals are twilight a 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:40.820
 nocturnal but ultra parry to see your 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.350
 nice move in the morning or in 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.210
 the early evening to go from one point 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.300
 to another or so to take a bath 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.440
 for this gift to bathe in in his 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.210
 water bowl etc 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.100
 in his small pool is an animal 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.050
 which is still pretty healthy assets to 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.570
 send for this animal that moves like 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.750
 a pretty good past when you 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.310
 handle it in town you're a little 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.860
 everywhere like that it makes me even a little 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.690
 laughing sails is doing 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.540
 a little time lapse and we see 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.910
 frankly we really feel that there 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.310
 serve well it's an animal is not du 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.810
 ltte not this one is not an adult 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.460
 but we already feel that it's going to be a 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.830
 beast that will still have a 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.140
 some hug 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:24.080
 with still some 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.910
 power so it's an animal that 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.320
 I like 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.750
 so here I hope that this little 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.030
 presentation 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:34.760
 we will say summary on the specimen you 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.950
 I will try to introduce you 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.040
 others other reptiles of my 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.050
 collection in future videos 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.860
 I thank you and I wish you a 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.000
 very good day 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.000
 thank you very much, goodbye
