00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.300
 we are back with a delicious 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.300
 Peach pie is very simple to make 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.660
 they're just going to need a little bit of 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.500
 butter sugar eggs essence 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.780
 vanilla flour and then for the filling 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.310
 let's also use some eggs 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.920
 cream to beat sugar is not chopped and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.109
 peaches cut into cubes can be 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.449
 during the syrup and also a bit of 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.969
 flour to spread the dough spread 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:42.550
 who said extend to extend it more 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:46.339
 vice view is another is an extension hey 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.519
 well let's put here in the blender 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.379
 leslie let's put the butter that 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.899
 in this case I melted it a little 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.280
 in the microwave I spent 10 seconds 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.860
 to soften the but not much and what 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.630
 let's mix 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.630
 with sugar to creams 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.170
 there goes our hope that fast that there 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.570
 goes until he starts creating our 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 butter now it will go up 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 so much more to see if it is let's go to 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.810
 add the eggs 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.130
 a little egg comes out 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.130
 already inside and there goes another 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 to states 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.520
 and we're also going to let it get incorporated 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.240
 I'm going to go up a little bit 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.530
 to the law of serious innovation for back 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.530
 because if not if I order you 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 and we're going to let it start then to beat 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 we are going to add the essence of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.540
 vanilla 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 and now hold on because it gives them the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 flour in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.409
 they already have their bets full 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.520
 and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:13.660
 paying because I want I already lost what I 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.070
 you brought me distraction gÃ¼ero is my 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.020
 Grandpa 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.150
 no longer just of cannon there is already every test 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.030
 that we chelas hear this and they 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 I say good that we're going to put them together 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.050
 we do not want to count them the bet 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.819
 beats me me yes and let us now 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.040
 add Matarina elevates 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.920
 holy god we are applying for all 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.590
 parts everywhere else we will 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.799
 add a little more I already as I saw that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.799
 active high I already threw everything and it does not matter 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.570
 if it's her, it helps me to extend it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.070
 it's good, we're not going, we're going to clean it 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.290
 not because if not what wave he hears good already 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.820
 start making the dough in what is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.090
 I take the opportunity to clean a 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.340
 little bit because holy god I almost did not 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.990
 threw he never threw never truly not 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.190
 never throw is the truth is that I am and I 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.480
 says the support 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.970
 meanwhile I'm going to take a bowl here 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.140
 to make all the roll the filling and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.840
 here I'm going to mix some eggs 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.660
 the three little eggs come out 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.670
 one 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:45.599
 to see in English the parrots account 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.900
 this one is one two and one parrot very 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.640
 all right 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.930
 to see and in French 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.930
 what would be the French and have parakeet 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.290
 d 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.290
 walk around parakeet 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.040
 4 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.099
 well let's mix the eggs and you 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.940
 let's add the cream part of 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.940
 chile pericÃ³n 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.560
 is displayed to that parrot we are going to 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.560
 add sugar too 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.340
 and incorporate all 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.990
 now if we add the nut 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.930
 and the peach the peach I love has 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.570
 a lot of calcium 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.520
 handyman so I do not know if they're 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.759
 pregnant women take calcium 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.759
 but also calcium is always good 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.120
 for whatever is over or better 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.280
 that about missing the header in the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.389
 cancer is very good for very 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.819
 good for the teeth and shot 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.990
 the result is that peach has not risen 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.240
 parrot will be me I think so 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.160
 I think that if you have to eat something that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.440
 parakeet parakeets but rather with 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.630
 bone 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:20.960
 that's what happened what happened 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.630
 I'm going to put this here and give you the 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.000
 Sababon forgive me forgive me here and now 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.510
 yes 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.120
 let's extend our mass in 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.820
 a little flour that we do not clean 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.120
 truth let's put some flour 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.260
 here 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.990
 I already told you 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.990
 and let's put some dough 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:54.520
 let's start to extend it where it is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:56.860
 there the roller and me and me where is and 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.370
 I here is there myself and the roller 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:05.699
 this we are going to extend our mass as 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.699
 they look pretty soft 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.199
 Y 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.379
 we can extend it to the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.800
 mold 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:19.770
 come here 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.409
 yes because they look is broken no matter what 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.970
 we extend in the mold I think what 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.729
 easier because it is very 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.819
 gentle this mass then you in 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.540
 little house can do it also like me 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.660
 with the fingers 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.210
 everything with your fingers always looks better and 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:42.560
 what we do is crush our 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:46.780
 mass on the edges of the refractory 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.780
 so it looks pretty 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.120
 and then we put the filling that 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.260
 we just did with the cream and the 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 peaches and the egg and the nut and now if 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:07.670
 we 're going to put it in the oven as some 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:10.670
 between 30 and 45 minutes at 180 degrees up 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:15.220
 let the clean stick come out if they want 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.220
 see how we are going to put this here 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.300
 let's learn it and now if what 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.520
 we are going to do is that this is what 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.510
 It must be delicious and delicious 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.810
 country 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.990
 of peach to order in the next 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:35.200
 information 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.200
 and here
