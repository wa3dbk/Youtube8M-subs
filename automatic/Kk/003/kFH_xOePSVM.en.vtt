00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and that's because I'm only doing this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
and that's because I'm only doing this
treatment<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.970> top<00:01:48.540> front<00:01:48.990> part<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> my

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
treatment on the top front part of my

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
treatment on the top front part of my
hair<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.009> got<00:01:50.189> highlights<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
hair which was got highlights on it so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580 
hair which was got highlights on it so
the<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.810> hair<00:01:51.960> doesn't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.259> highlights

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the back my hair doesn't have highlights

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
the back my hair doesn't have highlights
on<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> didn't<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> treatment

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
on so I didn't want to do that treatment

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
on so I didn't want to do that treatment
on<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:54.990> why<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.229> tied<00:01:55.380> away<00:01:55.619> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
and then I go again and then I like to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.770 
and then I go again and then I like to
and<00:04:01.250> divide<00:04:02.250> my<00:04:02.459> hair<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:02.970> apply<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
and divide my hair and apply it in the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.960 
and divide my hair and apply it in the
middle<00:04:03.900> parts<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.470> LA<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.860> did<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.070> again<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
middle parts of LA so I did it again and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.720 
middle parts of LA so I did it again and
it<00:04:06.270> was<00:04:06.450> too<00:04:06.750> much<00:04:06.870> product<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.400> okay

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it was too much product but it's okay

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.240 
it was too much product but it's okay
because<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.900> second<00:04:10.230> day<00:04:10.380> was<00:04:10.950> where<00:04:11.130> my

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250

hair<00:04:11.430> looked<00:04:11.610> best<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> second<00:04:12.840> day<00:04:12.930> so

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
hair looked best on the second day so

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.560 
hair looked best on the second day so

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
bits like this bit I definitely feel

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.990 
bits like this bit I definitely feel
like<00:04:38.570> these<00:04:39.570> ones<00:04:39.930> were<00:04:40.380> not<00:04:40.680> as<00:04:41.130> curly<00:04:41.970> as

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
like these ones were not as curly as

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.120 
like these ones were not as curly as
they<00:04:42.300> used<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.590> can<00:04:43.710> see<00:04:43.919> they

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
they used to be and as you can see they

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.250 
they used to be and as you can see they
are<00:04:44.160> sort<00:04:44.640> of<00:04:44.669> springing<00:04:45.060> back<00:04:45.180> now<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.840> you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
are sort of springing back now and you

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.420 
are sort of springing back now and you
can<00:04:46.410> see<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.740> through<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.040> rest<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.310> my<00:04:47.370> hair

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
can see that through the rest of my hair

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.940 
can see that through the rest of my hair
as<00:04:47.760> well<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.930> didn't<00:04:49.200> work<00:04:49.229> completely

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
as well and so it didn't work completely

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.400 
as well and so it didn't work completely
overnight<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:51.360> know<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.720> think<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.169> will

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
throughout my hair and then I went in

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.960 
throughout my hair and then I went in
with<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.900> co<00:05:53.110> definer<00:05:53.470> I<00:05:53.770> wasn't<00:05:54.280> sure<00:05:54.460> how<00:05:54.490> much

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
with a co definer I wasn't sure how much

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.630 
with a co definer I wasn't sure how much
that<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.240> needed<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.750> use<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.470> usually<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.430> just

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
that I needed to use so usually I just

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.760 
that I needed to use so usually I just
apply<00:05:57.910> loads<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:59.020> my<00:05:59.140> hair<00:05:59.320> and<00:05:59.530> that's<00:05:59.650> why<00:05:59.740> I

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
apply loads to my hair and that's why I

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.100 
apply loads to my hair and that's why I
did<00:05:59.920> with<00:06:00.040> this<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.940> was<00:06:01.090> too<00:06:01.360> much<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:02.080> I

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
did with this and it was too much so I

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.050 
did with this and it was too much so I
will<00:06:02.470> definitely<00:06:02.620> say<00:06:03.010> that<00:06:03.040> a<00:06:03.250> little<00:06:03.760> goes<00:06:04.030> a

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
will definitely say that a little goes a

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.060 
will definitely say that a little goes a
long<00:06:04.450> way<00:06:04.720> with<00:06:04.870> his<00:06:05.050> product<00:06:05.470> because<00:06:05.980> I
