00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.880
 Here I am to explain how to cut 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.280
 the cuticle 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.170
 these are the two ute in silio that the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.500
 Most times they are the most used 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.320
 to cut the cuticle this is the one 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.300
 I use at a more professional level the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.040
 advantage of the pliers is that you can do 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 a more precise cut and reach areas 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.810
 more delicate 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.810
 the cuts have to be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.750
 very soft 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.839
 but surely as you see it goes 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 raising the skin fold that is 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.890
 The cuticle is important to avoid stretching 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.500
 because what I would do would be to favor 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.390
 the appearance of stepparents is not valid 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.659
 make cut and pull you have to follow the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.030
 cuticle line 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.100
 squeezing and cutting 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.220
 I advise you to go through the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 same site that suddenly cut all 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.509
 because if you pass you could damage skin 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.210
 that is no longer a cuticle and that's when 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.310
 you could make blood once I've passed 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.800
 the first time if I see that there is still 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.800
 cuticle drained a little more 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 very carefully 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.660
 I'm removing already on the concrete sites 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.660
 where I continue to see that it is necessary 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.159
 with the pliers also what you can 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.670
 to do is remove those skins chairs that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.490
 come out on the sides of the nail 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 that aesthetically do not look pretty 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.350
 we remove those skins and leave the nail 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.760
 completely clear 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.030
 and aesthetically, so much prettier 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.340
 It is also useful to remove for example 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.860
 if there was a stepfather but as 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.190
 always tighten but do not hit pull 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.660
 the other utensil that also what 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.840
 they use a lot of people who are 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.370
 the cuticle to themselves because of course 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.100
 you can learn to use the pliers 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.180
 but with the right well but as 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.580
 have to do but with the left 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.260
 it's going to cost you a little bit more then 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 the one that is usually used is this 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 that has this way so peculiar 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.660
 that area there is the one that cuts and what 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.510
 must be done from a lateral support 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.000
 and go pushing as if you were 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.940
 drawing you have to do a little bit of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.010
 force 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.150
 and it's important that it's good because if 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.880
 It does not cut well what you will do 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.780
 tear the cuticle you see how the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.120
 skin 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.640
 the only thing is that this one to remove 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.220
 those skins illas then you see how 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.800
 It costs a little more, do not get it from there 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.260
 that I see much better that you learn to 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.140
 use the pliers especially if you see 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.760
 dedicate professionally but good if 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.220
 it's for you to have some nails 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.800
 neat and learn to remove the cuticle 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.060
 with this the truth you can 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.209
 and find the point 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.880
 in this is not necessary and in this then 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.209
 look I'm going to use this again so that 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.209
 you see 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.459
 but it's like all practice base 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.920
 you will get better results for 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.230
 remove the cuticle or to use it 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.170
 Professionally remove the cuticle 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.879
 it's a matter of patience, serenity and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.150
 as I said very slowly and without 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.920
 hurry good because you know how you can 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.190
 cut the cuticle with these two 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.190
