00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.630
 go out to dinner with friends 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.630
 is the absolute disaster 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 I was not 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.890
 most of my relationship always ended the gate 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.569
 and two second places 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.569
 about the Frankfurter Hof that shared the office from shortly 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.410
 fantastic atmosphere 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 the service is not so much what client regrets HSG I would like to help 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.100
 Here I am directly at the DAX Homeyer 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 he is champagne and then I would have the whole thing 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 what do you want more 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.120
 a few times 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 ca 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.730
 come this answer that it sometimes happens that he is not there and the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.270
 not always 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.690
 the notorious 8 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 So I had a fucking comeback 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
 make a coke 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.710
 Oh yes 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.470
 Cola Light 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.740
 the Viennese Court Opera Voldo so far seems sometimes also money 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.230
 Dr 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.590
 Unresolved it is not so good 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.900
 everything 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.900
 not necessary 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 No, okay, okay 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.200
 and how you need a title 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.830
 These only for the enjoyment of 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.030
 to seek with Martin Janda 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 APA knew some of it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.520
 I will explain 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 these photos and data about the Samsung 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.410
 what you do 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.410
 I am deeply upset 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.289
 are back in Germany
