00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
trouble we have at the moment is that we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.570 
trouble we have at the moment is that we
attacking<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.080> sports<00:01:10.950> competition<00:01:11.490> they

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
attacking on sports competition they

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
attacking on sports competition they
give<00:01:11.729> us<00:01:11.850> more<00:01:11.970> scope<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:14.040> you're<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
give us more scope but when you're in a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
give us more scope but when you're in a
Champions<00:01:14.640> League<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.060> can't<00:01:15.299> play<00:01:15.450> players

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

like<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.020> left<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> comment<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.619> hopefully

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
like that left a comment so hopefully

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.429 
like that left a comment so hopefully
the<00:01:17.189> FA<00:01:17.460> can't<00:01:17.759> maybe<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.119> lead<00:01:18.750> cops<00:01:19.049> were

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the FA can't maybe the lead cops were

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.200 
the FA can't maybe the lead cops were
given<00:01:19.650> an<00:01:19.710> opportunity<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.189> say<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.060> may

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
given an opportunity to say but may

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and it's proving it oh it time and time

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.840 
and it's proving it oh it time and time
again<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:45.990> need<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> pay<00:01:46.560> their<00:01:46.770> over<00:01:47.729> the

again it just need to pay their over the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
again it just need to pay their over the
past<00:01:48.119> few<00:01:48.240> seasons<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.780> drop<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
past few seasons that to drop back in

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.039 
past few seasons that to drop back in
order<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.149> help<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> position<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.869> haven't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
order to help out in position we haven't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.840 
order to help out in position we haven't
been<00:01:52.170> strong<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
been strong in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.520 
been strong in
I<00:01:52.909> think<00:01:53.330> when<00:01:53.659> you've<00:01:53.780> got<00:01:53.930> players<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.439> 0

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
I think when you've got players in 0

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.499 
I think when you've got players in 0
positions<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.159> he<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:55.670> trust<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.210> they

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
positions that he can trust and they

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.670 
positions that he can trust and they
doesn't<00:01:56.840> feel<00:01:56.990> we<00:01:57.080> have<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.259> come<00:01:57.409> back<00:01:57.560> and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
doesn't feel we have to come back and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.620 
doesn't feel we have to come back and
fill<00:01:57.860> those<00:01:58.040> positions<00:01:58.189> then<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.150> feel<00:01:59.360> yeah

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
fill those positions then I feel yeah

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.210 
fill those positions then I feel yeah
definitely<00:01:59.930> no<00:02:00.350> doubt<00:02:00.530> about<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.740> we<00:02:00.920> might<00:02:01.040> on
