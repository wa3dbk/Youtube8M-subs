00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
made it look pretty much at my

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.809 
made it look pretty much at my
perspective<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.709> they're<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.280> same<00:03:22.489> pretty

camera use camera and use camera and
then<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.150> dot<00:03:53.420> like<00:03:54.049> that's<00:03:54.560> all<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.799> have<00:03:55.010> to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
then you dot like that's all you have to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.530 
then you dot like that's all you have to
do<00:03:55.510> from<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.959> can<00:04:00.139> render<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.540> all

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
do from there you can render it and all

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.270 
do from there you can render it and all
this<00:04:02.930> stuff<00:04:03.170> just<00:04:08.290> keep<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.470> forgetting<00:04:09.680> to

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
this stuff just keep on forgetting to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.270 
this stuff just keep on forgetting to
render<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.700> perspective<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:15.139> open<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
render the perspective you open it and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.690 
render the perspective you open it and
it<00:04:16.489> gives<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:17.030> nice<00:04:17.389> depth<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.500> starts<00:04:19.459> to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
it gives it a nice depth like starts to

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.480 
it gives it a nice depth like starts to
blur<00:04:20.060> as<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.539> goes<00:04:20.690> by<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:22.039> I<00:04:22.130> think<00:04:22.220> that

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
blur as it goes by and I think that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.760 
blur as it goes by and I think that
looks<00:04:22.700> really<00:04:22.789> nice<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:26.260> that's<00:04:27.260> how<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.530> make

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
looks really nice so that's how to make

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.100 
looks really nice so that's how to make
a<00:04:27.830> scene<00:04:28.160> look<00:04:28.520> more<00:04:29.090> realistic<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.870> guess<00:04:32.110> from

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
a scene look more realistic I guess from

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.110 
a scene look more realistic I guess from
there<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.560> just<00:04:33.830> good<00:04:34.099> modeling<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.880> good

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
there it's just good modeling and good

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.839 
there it's just good modeling and good
texturing<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.780> bump<00:04:36.110> maps<00:04:36.580> all<00:04:37.580> right<00:04:37.700> well

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
texturing and bump maps all right well

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.110 
texturing and bump maps all right well
