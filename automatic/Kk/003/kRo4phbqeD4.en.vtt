00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.399
 welcome to a new video and in this 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.680
 I bring you two themes the links of 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.290
 download are here below is a file 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.449
 Well, you know right click 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.430
 extract here and it will leave this folder 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.560
 that brings about 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.110
 well these three files that the first 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.680
 is the patch to patch your windows 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.780
 7 and you can install good third-party themes 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 because in this case this is the patch 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 of 32 bits I could not get the 4 of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.190
 bits but that you can get it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 easily this good is that I'm 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.930
 using that is there is no crystal that is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.210
 this in itself does not come in folder but it is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 an application only to click 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 right here and execute as 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 administrator and started to start like 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.509
 a this as an installer is going to ask you 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
 that you make your computer restarts them 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.340
 If you already have this subject, the truth is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 pretty good with this interface here in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.990
 the windows that are not curved but already 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 are 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.780
 straight and here by putting the cursor here in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 minimize minimize buttons and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.970
 close then it lights up then it is 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.460
 a pretty good subject that looks very 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.050
 good with colorful wallpapers 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.810
 clear and good because it looks very elegant 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.350
 and well, the second one is the issue 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.570
 are that I show you next 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.479
 and good because this is the second issue 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.950
 it's our era it also looks pretty 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.410
 good with transparent windows 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.670
 same with here the corners already straight 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.760
 and well, it gives a pretty view 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.209
 nice 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.700
 here as they see the same and does not let us see 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.170
 the icons here but then true the menu 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.170
 home looks good with this theme 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 Well, we have reached the end of this 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.959

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.730
