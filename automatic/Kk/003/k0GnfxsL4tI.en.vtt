quick here and I've also see where this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.260 
quick here and I've also see where this
stem<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.060> nice<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
stem is you can really see it nice and

stem is you can really see it nice and
clear<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.790> stamps<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.940> that's<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.510> my

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
clear on the stamps so that's one of my

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.100 
clear on the stamps so that's one of my
kind<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.260> lining<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.510> points<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.989> I'm

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
kind of like lining up points then I'm

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.790 
kind of like lining up points then I'm
gonna<00:02:22.230> take<00:02:22.470> my<00:02:22.530> grid<00:02:22.950> paper

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
gonna take my grid paper

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.870 
gonna take my grid paper
and<00:02:23.920> I'm<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> over<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.500> just

like I've got all the edges and part of
the<00:02:36.810> parts<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.140> stamp<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> rubbed

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
the parts of the stamp kind of rubbed

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.740 
the parts of the stamp kind of rubbed
down<00:02:40.360> I'm<00:02:41.140> gonna<00:02:41.260> pull<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> off<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.750> that's

and the cherry cobbler here I'm going to
use<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> early<00:03:02.590> espresso<00:03:02.830> today<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.520> if<00:03:03.610> you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
use the early espresso today but if you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.630 
use the early espresso today but if you
can<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.540> see<00:03:05.080> how<00:03:05.260> they<00:03:06.040> show<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.430> picture

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
can see see how they show in the picture

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.840 
can see see how they show in the picture
that<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.540> inside<00:03:08.260> core<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.040> paper<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.790> a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
that the inside core of this paper is a

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.410 
that the inside core of this paper is a
different<00:03:10.390> color<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.860> here<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.550> have<00:03:12.760> early

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
different color so here I have early

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.420 
different color so here I have early
espresso<00:03:13.660> with<00:03:14.050> me<00:03:14.410> today<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.040> that's<00:03:15.250> we're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
in real close can you see how its

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.780 
in real close can you see how its
textured<00:03:19.330> here<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.900> then<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> other<00:03:21.340> side

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
textured here and then on the other side

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.950 
textured here and then on the other side
it's<00:03:22.420> very<00:03:23.050> smooth<00:03:23.590> all<00:03:24.520> right<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.750> this

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
it's very smooth all right now so this

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.670 
it's very smooth all right now so this
is<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.290> front<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.570> I'm<00:03:28.570> going<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.959> put<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.410> in

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
is the front and I'm going to put it in

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.610 
is the front and I'm going to put it in
a<00:03:29.950> texture<00:03:30.520> folder<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.630> new<00:03:31.840> wood

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
a texture folder this is the new wood

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.650 
a texture folder this is the new wood
grain<00:03:32.950> folder<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.940> let<00:03:34.090> us<00:03:34.240> see<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.480> better

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
grain folder you let us see it better

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.740 
grain folder you let us see it better
once<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.140> get<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.680> here<00:03:36.240> now<00:03:37.240> another

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
once I get this in here now another

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.720 
once I get this in here now another
thing<00:03:37.840> about<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.640> paper<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.400> seems

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
thing about the paper is that it seems

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.410 
thing about the paper is that it seems
to<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> little<00:03:43.510> bit<00:03:43.750> lighter<00:03:44.080> weight<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.420> so

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
to be a little bit lighter weight and so

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420 
to be a little bit lighter weight and so
it's<00:03:46.810> um<00:03:47.380> when<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.800> put<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.100> through<00:03:48.250> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
it's um when you put it through the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.760 
it's um when you put it through the
texture<00:03:48.850> folders<00:03:49.300> like<00:03:49.810> here<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.530> one

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
texture folders like here I have one

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.940 
texture folders like here I have one
already<00:03:50.980> done<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.900> becomes<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.650> little<00:03:53.830> more

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
already done it becomes a little more

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.910 
already done it becomes a little more
fragile<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:55.300> sometimes<00:03:55.930> we'll<00:03:56.110> even<00:03:56.260> do<00:03:56.530> just

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
fragile and sometimes we'll even do just

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.590 
fragile and sometimes we'll even do just
maybe<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.280> tearing<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.300> came<00:03:58.510> out

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
maybe a little tearing this one came out

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.230 
maybe a little tearing this one came out
pretty<00:03:58.870> good<00:03:59.110> but<00:04:00.010> that's<00:04:00.370> okay<00:04:00.760> because<00:04:00.790> when

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
pretty good but that's okay because when

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.810 
pretty good but that's okay because when
you<00:04:01.360> go<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.570> put<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.170> your<00:04:02.380> card<00:04:02.770> I<00:04:03.160> actually

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
you go to put it on your card I actually

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.660 
you go to put it on your card I actually
recommend<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.260> put<00:04:05.530> your<00:04:05.709> adhesive<00:04:06.370> on

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
recommend that you put your adhesive on

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.140 
recommend that you put your adhesive on
