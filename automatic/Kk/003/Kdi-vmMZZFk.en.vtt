00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
I made the key and I was getting some

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.910 
I made the key and I was getting some
codes<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:17.359> ews<00:00:18.359> temporary<00:00:19.230> protection<00:00:21.920> what

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
codes like ews temporary protection what

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.929 
codes like ews temporary protection what
I<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.160> doing<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:24.380> spinning<00:00:25.380> over<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
I was doing it was spinning over but it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.260 
I was doing it was spinning over but it
was<00:00:27.090> still<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> no<00:00:27.720> start<00:00:32.000> it's<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.090> be

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
was still like a no start it's gonna be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.250 
was still like a no start it's gonna be
the<00:00:33.420> BMW<00:00:34.230> code<00:00:34.700> 27:37<00:00:35.700> DME<00:00:36.090> WS<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> tempering

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.380 

which<00:00:43.260> means<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.460> DME<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.809> cast<00:00:47.390> allows

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
which means the DME and the cast allows

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.880 
which means the DME and the cast allows
the<00:00:48.629> loss<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> sink<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.700> lost<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> code

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
the loss the sink or they lost the code

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
the loss the sink or they lost the code
maybe<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> rag<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> battery<00:00:54.719> has

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
maybe because the rag or the battery has

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.189 
maybe because the rag or the battery has
been<00:00:55.079> disconnected<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.070> long<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:58.170> don't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
been disconnected for so long we don't

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
been disconnected for so long we don't
know<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.039> go<00:00:59.190> ahead<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> DME

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
know so let's go ahead and do the DME

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:16.789 
know so let's go ahead and do the DME
and<00:01:00.809> cache

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:28.020 

let's<00:01:17.799> go<00:01:18.240> into<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.390> judgment<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:27.030> terminal

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
let's go into that judgment I terminal

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.560 
let's go into that judgment I terminal
change<00:01:28.299> which<00:01:28.659> means<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.280> turn<00:01:30.280> off<00:01:31.270> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
change which means I turn off the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.249 
change which means I turn off the
ignition<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:34.299> will<00:01:34.600> wait<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:35.049> few

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
ignition they will wait for a few

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
ignition they will wait for a few

good all right
we<00:02:23.340> did<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> terminal<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:25.070> let's<00:02:26.070> go<00:02:26.220> ahead

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
we did that terminal off let's go ahead

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:38.330 
we did that terminal off let's go ahead
and<00:02:26.460> do<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:36.560> all<00:02:37.560> right<00:02:37.740> let's<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.100> what<00:02:38.130> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
does
where<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.290> RPMs<00:02:40.770> good<00:02:44.300> okay

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.870 

that<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.760> my<00:02:58.940> no<00:02:59.180> light<00:02:59.480> because<00:02:59.990> like<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> said

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
that is my no light because like I said

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.280 
that is my no light because like I said

feel pressure
in<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.250> case<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.959> DME<00:03:16.469> and<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.189> cars<00:03:17.519> which

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
in this case the DME and the cars which

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.020 
in this case the DME and the cars which
is<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.599> immobilizer<00:03:19.400> for<00:03:20.400> some<00:03:20.579> reason<00:03:20.909> they

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
is the immobilizer for some reason they

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.429 
is the immobilizer for some reason they
lost<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.599> rolling<00:03:22.140> code<00:03:22.819> okay<00:03:23.900> with<00:03:24.900> no<00:03:25.049> rolling

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
lost a rolling code okay with no rolling

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:32.150 
lost a rolling code okay with no rolling
code<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.579> engine<00:03:26.909> will<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.239> start<00:03:29.030> thank<00:03:30.030> you
