00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
kind of think of the actual chemical

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
kind of think of the actual chemical
that's<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> fruit<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.690> they're<00:00:42.870> saying

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that's in the fruit but they're saying

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
that's in the fruit but they're saying
that<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.410> body<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:44.040> produces<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that your body actually produces that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.779 
that your body actually produces that
when<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.270> younger<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.710> disappears<00:00:47.309> as

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
when it's younger and it disappears as

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
when it's younger and it disappears as
you<00:00:48.059> age<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> eat<00:00:49.020> avocados<00:00:49.850> still

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you age but if you eat avocados still

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
you age but if you eat avocados still
get<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> vitamin<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.410> need<00:00:52.620> for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
get the vitamin that that you need for

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.950 
get the vitamin that that you need for
this<00:00:53.070> enzyme<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.149> produced<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.899> body

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
this enzyme to be produced in your body

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
this enzyme to be produced in your body
so<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.949> keeps<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.280> looking<00:00:56.399> young<00:00:56.610> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
healthy it could be better

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
healthy it could be better

here you want the air to be able to get
up<00:01:19.320> through<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> roots<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.310> suffer

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
up through the roots because they suffer

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.950 
up through the roots because they suffer
from<00:01:21.450> diseases<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.619> viruses<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
from diseases and viruses that and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.850 
from diseases and viruses that and
they're<00:01:25.200> too<00:01:25.439> wet<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:28.080> run

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

havoc on them they're a little bit
harder<00:01:30.570> than<00:01:30.780> maybe<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.710> common<00:01:32.040> citrus<00:01:32.750> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
harder than maybe the common citrus but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.640 
harder than maybe the common citrus but
well<00:01:33.990> worth<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
rainforest tree so they have surface

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.300 
rainforest tree so they have surface
feeder<00:01:56.369> roots<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.310> is

feeder roots so what you want to do is
you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> feed<00:01:59.909> from<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> top<00:02:00.649> so

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you want to feed from the top so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.859 
you want to feed from the top so
