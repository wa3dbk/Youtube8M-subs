00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 all people and welcome to my 18th 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.750
 follow games myths 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.120
 today it is about another topic and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.870
 though not even pokÃ©mon or mario or 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320
 Is there anything else 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.420
 but ask about world of warcraft 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 you just okay what came road of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.029
 rent warcraft now for myths 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.449
 yes, there is not a lot 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.670
 known but under red-red often fans 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.149
 it is probably known that will 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 I achieve now 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 World of Warcraft is probably that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 Most famous mmo rpg play in the world 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.170
 Peak times can be reached with the game 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.940
 over 12 million subscribers and makes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.460
 a turnover of well over one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
 billion dollars 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.770
 Reason enough the game also in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 Guinness Book of Records as 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.750
 most popular multiplayer online 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 Role-playing record such a big one 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.609
 success and above all, such a big one 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.840
 Number of active players are best 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 Indicators for myths around the game 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.210
 even though it may not be countless 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 syllable and for myths around wow are so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 hides one of the best known 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 maybe even one of the scariest 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 no single from alvin right in front of the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 allianz six children with the names anna 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.299
 loos erin cameron lisa and also the gold 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.759
 Homeschoolers are called between seven 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.750
 and eight o'clock there and 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.159
 deliver a really great spectacle 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 The children do the daily 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 same route starting at the house on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 crystal over storm wind to gold 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.310
 home to the 9th 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.490
 to the north behind and back in the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 house from which they came 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.310
 this tour lasts about an hour and a half 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.229
 is completely identical every day 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 does not sound unusual at first 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 but now it gets scary 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.799
 the children stay on their way namely 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 stand and form every now and again 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.590
 together a pentagram in which 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.959
 every child at a corner represents wherein 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 always the same children too 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.209
 same pose 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.580
 to relate this pentagram shapes you 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.910
 on her way over and over again 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.700
 No matter where you go, they look 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.230
 not always the same 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.910
 Nevertheless they make up the sky 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.680
 in common only a diesel a form 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.060
 Then you are in your own home on 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.140
 Crystal arrived 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.700
 so the whole thing gets even scarier there 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 that changes all at once 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 background music and looks somber and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.040
 scary also the children do not 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 more the usual formation but you 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 stand opposite each other when 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 one waits for an instant and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.980
 listening carefully so you can following sentence 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:10.470
 from the speakers the death is approaching or 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.629
 in English version Ruble 3 it will be 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.569
 suspects that it is the 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.510
 voice of thun acts which once 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.190
 a mighty old god was the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.139
 share scary children of gold 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.950
 but an allusion to the 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.829
 short story children of the corn of 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 stephen king be under the names 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.200
 Children of Wrath has already been filmed 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.400
 other signs of the evil but 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.230
 right in the name and should be 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.940
 the letters order the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.299
 initial letters of the individual children 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.819
 sum up and then through sex part 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:53.510
 the result would have to be 666 ie the 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:58.230
 number of antichrist rana medhi wrong with 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:04.200
 jfk cameron with c lisa with l and shawn 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:06.380
 with geotagging added up 4 + 10 + 13 + 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.090
 12 to 10 40 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.760
 and now divided by six so the 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.870
 Number of children are six will be 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 the u6 gives 666 though it is 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.430
 after the common period six nevertheless 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.430
 a really amazing result 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.110
 But are these children really? 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.540
 if so, why were you in the game? 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.530
 added 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.210
 in fact there are these children of 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.580
 share gold and they really do this 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.860
 mysterious scary things like above 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.780
 have been described 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.090
 So they were described by her too 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.180
 her house which is on the crystal she lies 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.889
 indicates a creepy allusion 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.470
 in the horrorfilm friday the thirteenth 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.160
 is from the year 1980, the 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.960
 there camp also on the so-called 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.449
 osterwick translates into German 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.460
 see and is there for several brutal ones 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.199
 murders 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.850
 one suspects that developer blizzard 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.400
 entertainment here only one 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.660
 so-called easteregg fed and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.880
 the games also settle a little 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.199
 usual operations from the rotor court 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.850
 consist of employing and maintaining 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.650
 Jesus , of all people, is such a big one 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.020
 Surprise must be possible 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.380
 never experienced 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.080
 So in my personal view I 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.039
 but never motocross gambled and I know 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:35.960
 I do not like this god or 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:37.910
 what is out there but I have so me 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.820
 did so a few friends play this and 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.099
 yes I think so okay my friend gamble 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.669
 robotic follower maybe i would have 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.880
 rent in front of kassel video game or so and 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.700
 in fact, I came across 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.700
 on this myth 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.890
 yes write me in the comments 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.240

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.230
 heard noises 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.460
 apropos noise in the description 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:13.040
 is the link for a video the 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.470
 einspieler has probably recorded the 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.870
 truth shows that these children are there 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.030
 really do these strange things 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.410
 Look at it when I look at it 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.530
 I was really right 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.970

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.220
 I'm really crazy then really 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.860
 taken and it was kind of scary 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.070
 but I 've got it though 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.350
 but no votes are all where they are 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.260
 then the pentagram formed correctly 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.320
 scary so be sure to check out
