00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
concussions are really they really suck

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
concussions are really they really suck
like<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.289> suck<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:49.800> stunned<00:00:50.190> or

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
like they suck to get stunned or

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
like they suck to get stunned or
concussion<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.629> whatever<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.440> don't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
concussion or whatever because i don't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
concussion or whatever because i don't
know<00:00:53.250> why<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> seem<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
know why they just seem like there's so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
know why they just seem like there's so
much<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:55.020> effective<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.010> can't<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
much more effective as in you can't you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
much more effective as in you can't you
can<00:00:56.670> hardly<00:00:57.059> move<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.780> last<00:00:58.079> longer<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
can hardly move they last longer and you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.910 
can hardly move they last longer and you
can<00:00:58.980> hardly<00:00:59.160> turn<00:00:59.489> around<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.120> walk<00:01:00.449> or

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
can hardly turn around or walk or

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
can hardly turn around or walk or
anything<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.129> i'm<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.399> hating<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.359> get

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
anything so i'm really hating when i get

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
anything so i'm really hating when i get
concussion<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.290> i<00:01:04.350> guess<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:04.769> why<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
concussion but i guess that's why it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
concussion but i guess that's why it
makes<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:05.880> important<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> stack<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
makes it more important to stack in

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
makes it more important to stack in
escrow<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.790> max<00:01:08.970> paired<00:01:09.210> with

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
escrow or not now take max paired with

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
escrow or not now take max paired with
tactical<00:01:10.140> mask<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:11.400> no<00:01:11.520> pro<00:01:11.760> perks<00:01:12.000> which

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
tactical mask there's no pro perks which

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
tactical mask there's no pro perks which
i<00:01:12.479> didn't<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.810> about<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.229> didn't<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.890> any

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
i didn't know about I didn't do any

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
i didn't know about I didn't do any
research<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> game<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.390> before<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
research on the game really before I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.859 
research on the game really before I
started<00:01:16.409> playing<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.369> came<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
started playing so I came in just

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.190 
started playing so I came in just
without<00:01:19.619> any<00:01:20.540> experience<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.659> knowledge<00:01:21.720> at

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
without any experience or knowledge at

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
without any experience or knowledge at
all<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.560> everything<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:24.060> soon<00:01:24.210> as

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
all so everything in the game as soon as

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
all so everything in the game as soon as
I<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.890> trying<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.130> learn<00:01:26.310> from

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I got it I was just trying to learn from

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.480 
I got it I was just trying to learn from
there<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.710> blind<00:01:29.070> going

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
there so it's pretty much blind going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
there so it's pretty much blind going
into<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> killstreaks<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.810> everything

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
into it the killstreaks and everything

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
into it the killstreaks and everything
was<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:31.950> freaking<00:01:32.430> me<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> weird

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
