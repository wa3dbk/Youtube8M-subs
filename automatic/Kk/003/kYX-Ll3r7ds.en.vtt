 showing us a ride right there that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 It seems like it was born, so this is it. 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.830
 A friend of mine 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 right cooling 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.000
 I will have a new recognition and the one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.490
 connection back there was cracked 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.830
 It was then placed replaced 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:42.330
 very cooling and 75% but it is well 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:48.710

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.400
 Cooling water in the radiator is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.190
