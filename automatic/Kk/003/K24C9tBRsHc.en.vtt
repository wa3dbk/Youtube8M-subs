00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.860
 or the black what we are going to do today is going to 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.860
 be like 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.690
 what we have had to do as the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 problem of the fish 2012 the product 2012 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.210
 as you can see but installed that when 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.500
 we want a profile on it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 in 2012 yes 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.100
 puts you an error or tells you to close the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.400
 program or some of that good for this 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.970
 error is very common since 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.550
 now there is the new version as well as the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.770
 old version that's why this happens and the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.220
 have contact with the internet as not 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.200
 accept the version of those who do not believe them 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 the profile what they have to do is 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.990
 download this folder 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.700
 konami is called and paste it here 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.159
 I have less 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.260
 someone in fact increases here the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.660
 I have 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.850
 and good to download this folder that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.100
 leave in the description of the video and a 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.409
 Once you finish the folder, they let you see 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.409
 is to say now the winrar shit 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.680
 good this folder this leave it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 second click extract here and that this 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 binder 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.260
 and here inside would be the profile could be 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.829
 that you have in particular can 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.090
 modify you then 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:52.479
 to give copy or cut as they want and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.689
 they go to documents and they call the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 box 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 good 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.350
 that 's how simple it would be and it would work 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.280
 but I can not show you why 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.039

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 of complete competence and of not following 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.920
