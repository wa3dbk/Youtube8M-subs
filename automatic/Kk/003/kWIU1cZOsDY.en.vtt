people in ought to be delivered back to
the<00:02:34.800> people<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.670> we're<00:02:35.820> trying

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
the people and that's what we're trying

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.540 
the people and that's what we're trying
