Rim the first step on designing robots
was<00:01:27.650> we<00:01:28.040> did<00:01:28.190> like<00:01:28.430> 40<00:01:28.910> 50<00:01:29.150> silhouettes<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.080> all

was we did like 40 50 silhouettes of all
the<00:01:30.620> robots<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:32.300> we<00:01:32.480> just<00:01:32.720> looked<00:01:32.960> at<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
the robots and we just looked at the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.690 
the robots and we just looked at the
cyllage<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.800> said<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.190> one's<00:01:34.430> good<00:01:34.670> this

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
cyllage and I said this one's good this

one's<00:01:35.090> good<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.480> one's<00:01:35.690> good<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.230> then<00:01:36.800> we

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
one's good this one's good and then we

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.500 
one's good this one's good and then we
would<00:01:37.040> grab<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.490> silhouette<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.180> start

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
would grab that silhouette and start

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.750
