00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.580 
see I'm it wasn't easy left but it
definitely<00:06:20.190> didn't<00:06:20.640> look<00:06:20.700> max<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:22.140> makes<00:06:22.440> me

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
definitely didn't look max it makes me

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.050 
definitely didn't look max it makes me
think<00:06:22.800> you<00:06:22.920> know<00:06:22.950> that's<00:06:23.190> three<00:06:23.760> or<00:06:23.820> four

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
think you know that's three or four

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.410 
think you know that's three or four
kilos<00:06:24.860> heavier<00:06:25.860> than<00:06:26.250> what<00:06:26.490> Mike<00:06:27.030> cell<00:06:27.270> was

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
kilos heavier than what Mike cell was

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.540 
kilos heavier than what Mike cell was
snatched<00:06:27.690> at<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.230> the<00:06:28.860> American<00:06:29.160> hope<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.520> I

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
snatched at the the American hope and I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.490 
snatched at the the American hope and I
think<00:06:29.760> he<00:06:29.820> only<00:06:29.940> made<00:06:30.180> 146<00:06:30.990> or<00:06:31.170> something<00:06:31.410> with

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
think he only made 146 or something with

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.260 
think he only made 146 or something with
American<00:06:31.830> open<00:06:32.100> um<00:06:33.050> so<00:06:34.050> you<00:06:34.140> see<00:06:34.320> that<00:06:34.350> 150<00:06:35.010> was

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
American open um so you see that 150 was

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.550 
American open um so you see that 150 was
obviously<00:06:36.270> heavier<00:06:36.630> than<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.960> when<00:06:37.290> I<00:06:37.320> was<00:06:37.530> a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.640 
obviously heavier than that when I was a
not<00:06:38.490> a<00:06:38.520> beautiful<00:06:39.000> juror<00:06:39.210> can<00:06:40.050> take<00:06:40.230> it<00:06:40.410> but
