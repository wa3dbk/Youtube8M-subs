00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.049
 this video was done by 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.049
 daily share 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.490
 and man of days cd today i am learning 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.010
 you know how to be a secret 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 floor unkempt point makes something i know 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.890
 not what I should call it but in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.530
 Nepal I'm going to explain how you make this 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 And then yes then you just ca n't do everything 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.880
 keep secret whatever you want 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.430
 so no one knows the from sees it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 enter the first block in the header 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 and me from hot depressions very strange 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.730
 which goes up so that you end up 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 watch if you want to get out 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 jump and yes let's get started 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 first you just grab yourself 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.350
 piss need do it and do 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 just it's a packet block that two 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 aside here and presses and in between 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.170
 and this blog away here you do another 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 sticky piston 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 I have this blood away whom following a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 block and then you have the boss was 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.460
 pretty simple or not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 a case I found very simple 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.180
 then I pick up a repeater that shit show 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.979
 down and do the second sign is bad 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.619
 important because otherwise everything goes 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.840
 do something weird and then you just work 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.880
 no more than you have there is a box in it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.990
 a block here you do a trip one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.070
 torch 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.070
 here like it 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 res him then grab this block here like this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.810
 on dropper it must be a drop family 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.159
 very important 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.799
 suit in hopper are you against it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.650
 concerns that solar driving is in it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.360
 it is such a would do then i grab one 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.070
 repeater on something you do it oh you sit 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.200
 also the two me very important 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.259
 and do you here in a random blog 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.170
 any wall paints rest would pack things then 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.450
 you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.210
 block a computer again something very 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.149
 important that those two things and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.580
 hope wise so that yes mechanisms that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.869
 a block here than the rest 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.130
 then this goes ff space and it makes 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.200
 not at all it is just as good 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.920
 he does that is very good 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.980
 then grab a copestone them or console 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 yes a block should not matter which one here 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.920
 you walk this is you here is your secret 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.819
 base 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.230
 thing you have again and one thing 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:39.069
 I assume people have coffins and yes that is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 there may be some day making and then 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.430
 I think so, but now he is like that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.440
 how do i get an old buildings and rwt's 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.299
 I see I have done something wrong 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.299
 I believe look 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.840
 aramis oh yes okay 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.030
 that will come later I saw something wrong 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.340
 done with I have not done 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.420
 Peter prepare got worse I'm leaving 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.130
 then do you put so down the way 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.790
 I work out which were on as long as you 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.310
 you have a suit you do such a block 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.359
 and then he writes in is this 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.570
 you 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:25.060
 ground it is young ground say in you 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.290
 home or so I know a lot where 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.030
 And then yes you have about 1 2 3 4 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.790
 dig blocks down to do this 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.760
 and it is quite small in itself and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.209
 then with this the city I believe yes 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.910
 middle ok then I'll do it like that 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.810
 it 's a simple one then grab one 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.810
 button like that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.000
 namenlijk away in a moment not so 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 show it that way and you just press that button 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.440
 connecting presso so so so 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.810
 another one low you should I care that he 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.880
 not against this judgment such a one arrives here 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.550
 because otherwise you have to wait it is too 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.200
 fault his 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.750
 it must be in a line then 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.710
 works best 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.930
 at least as far as I can 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.200
 remember this is so cold 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.200
 it goes well 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.500
 then if yes ok then you do another block 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.000
 because it is so bad and so bad and so necessary 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.840
 itself connector who knows it 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.080
 the torch then you go on your bloxam it 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.050
 useful to build a solid edge 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 the shere khan are in a better vt and 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.560
 normally it is naturally covered 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.350
 just cover it in think of yes how do i get there 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.660
 from here you know 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.820
 handy handy handy than three gentlemen 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.140
 button 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.140
 make redstone even party one this way 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.350
 ok you can do something here like me 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.680
 do i do it to it if you delay 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.140
 have 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.100
 it is the signal you have there 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.050
 delay 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.520
 which makes it easier for you to get out 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.940
 it can also be just as much here as 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.940
 good is 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.760
 when you go he sees a bit harder series 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.570
 not much but if I ate a verse 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.570
 ncd probably brands 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.280
 check out the first wages you have 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.220
 some more time to get out 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:41.200
