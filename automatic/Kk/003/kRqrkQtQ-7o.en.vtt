if<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.350> zoom<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.670> blue<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.479> would<00:01:36.630> be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
if we zoom in of the blue which would be

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.010 
if we zoom in of the blue which would be
into<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> 6<00:01:37.470> inch<00:01:37.650> range<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> st.<00:01:39.600> Catharines

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
into the 6 inch range so st. Catharines

niagara<00:01:40.409> falls<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> 6<00:01:41.430> inch<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.720> we

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
niagara falls into the 6 inch so as we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.270 
niagara falls into the 6 inch so as we
go<00:01:42.960> east<00:01:43.470> Prince<00:01:44.130> Edward<00:01:44.490> Island<00:01:44.820> down<00:01:45.240> here

go east Prince Edward Island down here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
go east Prince Edward Island down here
would<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.869> obviously<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> six-inch<00:01:49.500> as

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
would be obviously in the six-inch as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.660 
would be obviously in the six-inch as
well<00:01:49.829> renfrew<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.340> start<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
well renfrew up there so as we start to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.480 
well renfrew up there so as we start to
move<00:01:53.850> further<00:01:54.360> east<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.619> looking<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
move further east we are looking at a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.149 
move further east we are looking at a
lot<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.149> snowfall<00:01:57.619> because<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> system<00:01:59.070> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
lot more snowfall because the system is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
lot more snowfall because the system is
actually<00:01:59.310> pushing<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> from<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.689> east<00:02:00.719> moving

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
actually pushing in from the east moving

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.569 
actually pushing in from the east moving
west<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.759> very<00:02:02.790> common<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
west which is not very common so

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
west which is not very common so
kingston<00:02:05.579> down<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> baby<00:02:06.540> blue

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and that also just touches Ottawa so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.010 
and that also just touches Ottawa so
Ottawa<00:02:10.679> somewhere<00:02:11.220> between<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> six<00:02:12.840> and

a<00:02:17.489> decent<00:02:17.700> amount<00:02:17.909> as<00:02:18.319> we<00:02:19.319> move<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.859> little<00:02:20.010> bit

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
a decent amount as we move a little bit

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.470 
a decent amount as we move a little bit
more<00:02:20.340> east<00:02:20.689> cornwall<00:02:21.689> just<00:02:22.560> misses<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.489> 10

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
