based rubber so you're gonna have a lot

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:45.439 
based rubber so you're gonna have a lot
longer<00:00:44.249> life<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.819> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.149> water

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
longer life with a little more water

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.180 
longer life with a little more water
resistance<00:00:46.019> to<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.319> and<00:00:46.499> just<00:00:46.649> generally<00:00:47.159> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
resistance to them and just generally a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
resistance to them and just generally a
better<00:00:47.339> material<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.179> material<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
better material for the material for the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.169 
better material for the material for the
job<00:00:49.170> standard<00:00:50.129> ones<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.549> organic<00:00:50.819> rubber

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
job standard ones are an organic rubber

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.450 
job standard ones are an organic rubber
and<00:00:51.510> they'll<00:00:51.749> do<00:00:51.899> okay<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.229> a<00:00:52.530> while<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.249> over

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and they'll do okay for a while but over

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.770 
and they'll do okay for a while but over
time<00:00:53.609> you're<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.329> chips<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
breakaways on them and it's just gonna

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.169 
breakaways on them and it's just gonna
wear<00:00:56.249> out<00:00:56.429> and<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.909> do<00:00:57.059> their
