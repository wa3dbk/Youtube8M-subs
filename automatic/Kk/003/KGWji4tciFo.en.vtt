00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.969
 cosmetics cosmetics and a little bit 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 so the video will be short but 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 video then stay with me all 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 pleasant cosmo from the first start 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.410
 These are the first purchases of cosmetic cosmetics and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.449
 they were committed at the end of July then I 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.630
 did a survey of his VKontakte group on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.160
 about the kind of care you use 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 from the mass market that I could 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.640
 advise and girls follow me 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.129
 advised pretty much 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 I stopped the choice of products 1 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.829
 This cream from the manufacturer n.n. earlier 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 I have not heard about him as it turned out 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.059
 Polish cosmetics we sell it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 here and ate where actually bought this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 cream first of all I want to say 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.079
 that when a girl is an angel and a little bit 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.120
 upset because all the climate that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 moisturizing and nourishing they were 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 age not that is from a certain 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.580
 categories 25 + 30 + so on so on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.130
 I do not fit I was upset 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.930
 but to render found such a cream 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.799
 which is suitable for all skin types and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 all ages 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.210
 this is manga vitamin cream here 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.009
 There is even a spf10 in principle volume 50 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
 milliliters cream is very economical 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.570
 spends in a month and a half 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 use I used at all 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 a little bit I can say by my 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 I feel either normal 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 skin speed or dry skin in general i 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 still quite undecided 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 but rather I have it more 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.729
 combined prone to dryness 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.570
 because from s she's mostly there 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.350
 is observed 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.780
 cars like on cheeks or in others 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.300
 I don’t have it in places 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.180
 say that the texture in it is very light 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.420
 he has a nice aroma but 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.820
 if you were not so too eager for them 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 Front for me more suited color 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 so sweet peach 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 called here there are such here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.119
 blue granules do not know whether 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.700
 you can see it in these granules and fireplace e 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.320
 which when applied to the skin 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 pounded in general everything is fine 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.670
 eats cream very well fast 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 feeds is a good basis under 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
 makeup 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 I can say that perfectly moisturizes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.050
 nourishes the skin especially in the summer felt 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.470
 refreshing effect of this cream 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.910
 but unfortunately he is not fighting peeling 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.900
 that is , my carp is peeling in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.510
 basically it found 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.700
 so they are the abyss that did not advise 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 still girls serum knowing and unfortunately 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.300
 at that time there was no but you think that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.090
 thick finish this cream necessarily 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.090
 I will try because I have to peel 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.340
 have they not go anywhere in cost this 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 cream in the region of 45 hryvnia probably in 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.720
 District 50 even you can say so 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.180
 because in different cities differently in 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.000
 Basically, I liked this one. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.100
 brand or this cream and you can 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.079
 take a closer look I actually took a closer look 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.100
 not only the Kremlin following my purchase 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.040
 also a clearer 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.310
 This is such a torture for washing day and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.500
 in the evening it is a gentle wash gel 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.019
 extract but not for sensitive skin 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.650
 It moisturizes and soothes the skin. 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.079
 smell 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.060
 smell a little bit chemically i'm not even 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.299
 I know how to convey it pretty too 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.750
 strong and a little bit trendy that I don’t 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.450
 like the store itself 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.650
 This is what you know like a milk for 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.560
 makeup remover 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.870
 don't even wear like thicker in color he 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.000
 gently pink during use 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.390
 I also used one and a half months 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.980
 probably so much that he is very 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.350
 it is economically used 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.720
 It cleans the face of make-up is usually not 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.670
 happens first jelly then helium 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.250
 Much from the moment Leslie makeup in 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.020
 intense there point me not all eats 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.760
 either i get bored so i 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.850
 I wash this gel it perfectly cleans 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.070
 All cosmetics principle is important that he 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.720
 it doesn’t dry me the skin is just a plus 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.120
 that all the tools that are used for 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.489
 this mind is not much dried skin and this 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.850
 there was a problem and here he is really 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.950
 gently cleans it and there is no 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.080
 there are no irritations of inflammation from him 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.270
 dryness and flaking off of it in general 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.910
 I liked this gel too 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.900
 honestly don't remember my maybe in the area 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.290
 30 hryvnia 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.940
 somewhere so bought it in eva too 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.530
 The next product also includes 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.419
 but the same purchase in his not 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.940
 This is such a silicone brush 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.070
 which you could already see 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.780
 Probably in his father’s catalogs I’m in 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.419
 Generally honored I needed like this 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.370
 brush to cleanse the face and better you 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.070
 here it is the miniatures she took very 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.410
 many positive reviews and and many and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.050
 praised that it perfectly cleans such 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.900
 all new on dialysis in general ordered 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.000
 and in the catalog for 15 hryvnia and in principle 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.669
 It is certainly better than nothing because 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.400
 All the same, I clean the brush better than 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.080
 fingers just but I can say that here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.700
 the result is 100% straight I don’t 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.600
 very happy because I still 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.180
 need something more like that 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.610
 probably harder because it is quite 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.040
 such as for delicate myagenkaya 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.470
 purification i love more such remedies 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.330
 which are tighter and good 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.250
 intensively scrubs the skin 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.050
 peeling this here's a brush on me not 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.270
 clean peeling but not bad in principle 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.040
 cleans 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.170
 My next purchase was such 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.120
 hand cream that everyone knows but I 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.730
 for some reason he never took it I bought 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.860
 always you didn't suit me but my 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.900
 cream and you ended it I decided that 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.450
 need to try something new this 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.070
 ordinary cotton handles complex cream 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.470
 intensely moisturize nourish the skin 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.110
 strengthens the nails and nourishes 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.640
 cuticle here milk proteins vitamins 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.100
 ah um biotin in general well what can i say 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.750
 by the smell of such itself unobtrusively and but 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.470
 can't say some nice 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.080
 for me the aroma so that it strengthens 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.360
 news babbled cuticle nails he didn't 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.730
 strengthen it is not uniquely the cuticle 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.470
 He feeds on principle she is my dear good 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.490
 it becomes i mean i can quickly 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.470
 clean moisturizes a good average so 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.360
 say so he is a super duper cream too 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.160
 I can not in principle on the same 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.960
 as in the result as well as from even 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.730
 cream so special 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.710
 and much of a difference, and I have not noticed 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.870
 The last purchase for today is 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.970
 hair care products at 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.860
 least that's how i use it here 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.930
 such a coconut oil which 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.230
 ordered through the last to exit on 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.410
 10 on the site I got it for 200 hryvnia 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.630
 from 454 grams and went by itself 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.510
 transparent color she is insanely nice 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:40.950
 smell for me bounty to taste it 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:43.500
 no can tell using you 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.050
 August and use once a week on 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.280
 our entire length of hair unwinds 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.200
 I leave the trigger for the night 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.140
 what can I say first impression 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.150
 after use it is insanely voluminous 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.340
 such here are strong and be annual 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.310
 hair at least for me it was 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.140
 so did not like the feeling now for 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.730
 I easily wash it off 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.500
 at least kim shampoo which i 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:10.020
 I use and the effect remains with me 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.110
 shining hair with insane scent on 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.910
 hair but as if some 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.220
 I do not have such serious changes. 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.919
 seeing because i use it a little bit 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.900
 probably more than half a month 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.880
 I really liked it too 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.140
 I use it at the end and in order to 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.850
 there was no split ends 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.160
 it does after washing nanoshu 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.290
 a little bit of this oil on the palm 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.300
 rub and put on the ends of hair 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.910
 so I have a fragrant lasso 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.770
 saved and I kind of put the ends 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.740
 hair in order not to be signs and 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.240
 In general, they were not satisfied with the purchase, but in 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.530
