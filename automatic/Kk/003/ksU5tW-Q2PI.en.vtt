00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
quite a while to figure out just how

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
quite a while to figure out just how
everything's<00:00:39.540> gonna<00:00:39.660> look<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> looks

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
everything's gonna look if it looks

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.220 
everything's gonna look if it looks
awkward<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.820> looks<00:00:41.969> weird<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> just

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
awkward if it looks weird and just

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
awkward if it looks weird and just
messing<00:00:43.739> around<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> eyes<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.610> stuff

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
