before<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.810> push<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> power<00:01:43.320> button<00:01:43.700> there

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
before you push the power button there

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.679 
before you push the power button there
was<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.149> flash<00:01:45.450> should<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.530> again

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
was the first flash should see it again

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.120 
was the first flash should see it again
and<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> found<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.890> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and what I found is I can I can just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.410 
and what I found is I can I can just
keep<00:01:50.280> holding<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.119> people<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
keep holding it I think some people so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.550 
keep holding it I think some people so
you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.630> let<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> power<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:54.560> it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can let go of power there but it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.109 
you can let go of power there but it
seems<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.040> hey<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.520> ahead<00:01:56.610> let<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
seems to hey there go ahead let go of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.440 
seems to hey there go ahead let go of
power<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:59.340> let's<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
power and let's see if we can get it to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.859 
power and let's see if we can get it to
go<00:02:01.049> into<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.570> there<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.719> goes

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
go into there we go and there he goes

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
go into there we go and there he goes
and<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.350> should<00:02:04.649> does<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.490> check

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and this should does a little check

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.109 
and this should does a little check
thing<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.799> should<00:02:07.799> start<00:02:08.220> recovery<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
thing here should start recovery so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.290 
thing here should start recovery so
