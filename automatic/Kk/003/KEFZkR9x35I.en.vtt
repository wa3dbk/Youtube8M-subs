00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
with them they won't have

with them they won't have
airs<00:03:07.700> as<00:03:08.180> much<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:09.260> used<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.770> one<00:03:10.070> this<00:03:10.400> is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
airs as much as they used to one this is

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.820 
airs as much as they used to one this is
a<00:03:10.550> pretty<00:03:11.480> cool<00:03:11.780> thing<00:03:11.810> right<00:03:12.320> floating

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
a pretty cool thing right floating

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850 
a pretty cool thing right floating
stands<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> loading<00:03:14.090> lever<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:15.590> basically

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
stands on a loading lever but basically

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.340 
stands on a loading lever but basically
when<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.130> press<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.400> now<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.510> actually<00:03:17.810> works

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
when you press it now it actually works

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.560 
when you press it now it actually works
without<00:03:18.890> any<00:03:19.160> problem<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:19.790> basically<00:03:20.180> errors

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
without any problem so basically errors

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.610 
without any problem so basically errors
with<00:03:20.780> pistons<00:03:21.500> are<00:03:22.160> kind<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.910> removed<00:03:23.720> however

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
with pistons are kind of removed however

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.440 
with pistons are kind of removed however
the<00:03:24.800> problem<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:25.700> Pistons<00:03:26.120> also

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
the problem that is that Pistons also

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.290 
the problem that is that Pistons also
react<00:03:26.840> slightly<00:03:27.710> slower<00:03:28.310> than<00:03:28.610> they<00:03:28.790> used<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
react slightly slower than they used to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.660 
react slightly slower than they used to
so<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.750> might<00:03:30.050> have<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.230> change<00:03:30.670> repeaters

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
so you might have to change repeaters

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.090 
so you might have to change repeaters
delays<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.720> stuff<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.680> order<00:03:33.950> for

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
delays and stuff like that in order for

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.800 
delays and stuff like that in order for
your<00:03:34.370> contraption<00:03:34.940> still<00:03:35.150> still<00:03:35.570> work<00:03:35.780> with

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
your contraption still still work with

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.900 
your contraption still still work with
for<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.260> most<00:03:36.440> part<00:03:36.590> they<00:03:37.130> still<00:03:37.400> work<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.760> know

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
for the most part they still work I know

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.170 
for the most part they still work I know
a<00:03:38.240> new<00:03:38.570> feature<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.230> debug<00:03:40.070> command<00:03:40.940> that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
a new feature is the debug command that

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.090 
a new feature is the debug command that
I<00:03:41.480> actually<00:03:41.870> honestly<00:03:42.290> don't<00:03:42.770> know<00:03:42.860> how<00:03:43.040> to

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
I actually honestly don't know how to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.240 
I actually honestly don't know how to
use<00:03:43.190> but<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:44.240> you<00:03:44.420> understand<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.250> starts

trading desert and jungle temple stuff

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.570 
trading desert and jungle temple stuff
like<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.700> bad<00:04:07.850> side<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:09.580> that's

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
like that the bad side is that that's

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.130 
like that the bad side is that that's
quite<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.790> few<00:04:11.060> actually<00:04:11.720> which<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:11.990> you<00:04:12.110> know

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
quite a few actually which is you know

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.570 
quite a few actually which is you know
kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.530> sad<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.100> guess<00:04:13.850> but<00:04:14.209> up<00:04:14.920> first<00:04:15.920> off<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
kind of sad I guess but up first off the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.479 
kind of sad I guess but up first off the
frame<00:04:16.850> rate<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.239> still<00:04:17.450> low<00:04:17.810> laggy<00:04:18.170> my<00:04:19.100> potato

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
frame rate is still low laggy my potato

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.120 
frame rate is still low laggy my potato
is<00:04:19.730> running<00:04:20.420> fairly<00:04:20.690> well<00:04:21.109> but<00:04:21.140> it's<00:04:21.770> still

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
is running fairly well but it's still

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.310 
is running fairly well but it's still
not<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:22.790> fast<00:04:23.060> as<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.570> could<00:04:23.720> be<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.169> is

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
not as fast as it could be and this is

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.140 
not as fast as it could be and this is
because<00:04:24.650> once<00:04:25.220> again<00:04:25.340> single-player<00:04:26.030> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
because once again single-player and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.850 
because once again single-player and
multiplayer<00:04:26.330> have<00:04:27.110> sort<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.350> been<00:04:27.410> combined

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
multiplayer have sort of been combined

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.520 
multiplayer have sort of been combined
together<00:04:28.010> which<00:04:28.790> means<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.900> need<00:04:30.169> the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
together which means you need the

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.920 
together which means you need the
resources<00:04:30.980> to<00:04:31.550> run<00:04:31.820> multiplayer<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.720> that's

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
resources to run multiplayer and that's

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.460 
resources to run multiplayer and that's
also<00:04:33.190> how<00:04:34.190> single<00:04:34.580> player<00:04:34.730> runs<00:04:34.970> now<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.480> there

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
also how single player runs now so there

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.760 
also how single player runs now so there
is<00:04:37.010> ways<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.330> are<00:04:38.360> ways<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.690> solve<00:04:39.140> this<00:04:39.410> but

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
is ways there are ways to solve this but

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.980 
is ways there are ways to solve this but
to<00:04:40.160> optimize<00:04:40.669> this<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.390> won't<00:04:41.630> come<00:04:41.960> out

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
to optimize this but this won't come out

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.159 
to optimize this but this won't come out
till<00:04:42.730> 1.4<00:04:43.730> so<00:04:44.090> there<00:04:44.390> will<00:04:44.540> be<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.720> full<00:04:44.990> update

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
till 1.4 so there will be a full update

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.170 
till 1.4 so there will be a full update
where<00:04:45.560> our<00:04:45.740> frame<00:04:46.010> rate<00:04:46.190> will<00:04:46.370> be<00:04:46.400> slightly

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
where our frame rate will be slightly

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.909 
where our frame rate will be slightly
slower<00:04:47.600> than<00:04:47.900> it's<00:04:48.110> used<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.470> which<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.680> you

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
slower than it's used to which is you

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.470 
slower than it's used to which is you
know<00:04:48.950> just<00:04:49.250> exciting<00:04:49.970> great<00:04:50.210> I'm<00:04:50.450> looking

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
know just exciting great I'm looking

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.960 
know just exciting great I'm looking
forward<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.140> that<00:04:51.230> man<00:04:51.560> but<00:04:52.550> other<00:04:52.760> than<00:04:52.910> that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
forward to that man but other than that

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.510 
forward to that man but other than that
there<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.600> also<00:04:53.650> lighting<00:04:54.650> glitches<00:04:55.250> which

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
there is also lighting glitches which

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.970 
there is also lighting glitches which
look<00:04:55.820> pretty<00:04:56.120> ugly<00:04:56.570> right<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.169> these<00:04:57.919> are

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
look pretty ugly right and these are

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.050 
look pretty ugly right and these are
also<00:04:58.550> easy<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.540> fix<00:05:00.110> but<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.950> will<00:05:01.190> severely

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
also easy to fix but this will severely

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.930 
also easy to fix but this will severely
damage<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:03.200> frame<00:05:03.560> rate<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.550> they're<00:05:04.700> trying

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
damage the frame rate so they're trying

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.790 
damage the frame rate so they're trying
to<00:05:05.030> find<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.270> way<00:05:05.450> where<00:05:05.750> there<00:05:06.350> won't<00:05:06.560> be

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
to find a way where there won't be

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.980 
to find a way where there won't be
lighting<00:05:07.430> stuff<00:05:07.760> glitches<00:05:08.330> like<00:05:08.360> these<00:05:08.690> but

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
lighting stuff glitches like these but

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.170 
lighting stuff glitches like these but
it<00:05:09.200> won't<00:05:09.410> also<00:05:09.830> rape<00:05:10.430> your<00:05:10.610> minecraft

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
it won't also rape your minecraft

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.690 
it won't also rape your minecraft
because<00:05:11.480> of<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.200> one<00:05:12.860> frame<00:05:13.160> per<00:05:13.370> second

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
because of the one frame per second

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.210 
because of the one frame per second
thing<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.560> finally<00:05:15.560> what's<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.160> final<00:05:16.400> thing

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
thing and finally what's the final thing

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.950 
thing and finally what's the final thing
got<00:05:17.400> about<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.790> final<00:05:18.150> thing<00:05:18.300> what's<00:05:18.630> for

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
got about the final thing what's for

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.280 
got about the final thing what's for
final<00:05:19.440> thing<00:05:19.700> I'll<00:05:20.700> be<00:05:20.850> right<00:05:21.000> back<00:05:21.180> holy<00:05:22.020> poop

I<00:05:22.470> have<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.650> really<00:05:22.770> bad<00:05:22.860> memory<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.610> anyway<00:05:24.030> I

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
I have a really bad memory but anyway I

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.900 
I have a really bad memory but anyway I
remember<00:05:24.930> now<00:05:25.140> basically<00:05:26.010> it's<00:05:26.280> D<00:05:26.520> modding

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
remember now basically it's D modding

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.400 
remember now basically it's D modding
API<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.660> those<00:05:27.780> if<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.020> don't<00:05:28.290> know

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
API that for those if you don't know

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.500 
API that for those if you don't know
what<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.770> it's<00:05:29.430> basically<00:05:29.790> a<00:05:29.910> system<00:05:30.330> in

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
what that is it's basically a system in

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.630 
what that is it's basically a system in
which<00:05:30.540> installing<00:05:31.380> mods<00:05:31.590> will<00:05:32.040> be<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.310> much

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
which installing mods will be a much

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.090 
which installing mods will be a much
easier<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.450> since<00:05:34.290> that<00:05:34.410> sounds<00:05:34.980> like<00:05:35.070> a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
easier and since that sounds like a

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.000 
easier and since that sounds like a
pretty<00:05:35.310> cool<00:05:35.430> feature<00:05:35.790> right<00:05:36.290> it<00:05:37.290> was<00:05:37.560> rumored

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
pretty cool feature right it was rumored

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.000 
pretty cool feature right it was rumored
to<00:05:38.400> have<00:05:38.430> been<00:05:38.880> supposed<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.540> released<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.230> 1.3

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010

such<00:05:46.410> an<00:05:46.590> awesome<00:05:46.770> feature<00:05:47.430> why<00:05:47.760> is<00:05:47.820> mojang

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
such an awesome feature why is mojang

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.230 
such an awesome feature why is mojang
not<00:05:48.660> working<00:05:49.050> on<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.350> well<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:49.860> is<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.730> very

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
not working on it well it is a very

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.570 
not working on it well it is a very
ambitious<00:05:51.660> feature<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.470> they<00:05:53.100> have<00:05:53.280> actually

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
ambitious feature and they have actually

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.060 
ambitious feature and they have actually
started<00:05:54.180> on<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:55.080> first<00:05:55.290> step<00:05:55.500> towards

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
started on it the first step towards

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.460 
started on it the first step towards
this<00:05:56.190> amazing<00:05:57.030> modeling<00:05:57.360> AP<00:05:57.660> i<00:05:57.690> think<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.290> was

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
this amazing modeling AP i think it was

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.290 
this amazing modeling AP i think it was
to<00:05:58.890> combine<00:05:59.280> single-player<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.150> multiplayer

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
to combine single-player and multiplayer

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.080 
to combine single-player and multiplayer
which<00:06:00.930> i've<00:06:01.110> already<00:06:01.650> mentioned<00:06:02.090> basically

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
which i've already mentioned basically

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.640 
which i've already mentioned basically
what<00:06:03.300> that<00:06:03.330> does<00:06:03.690> is<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.900> makes<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.500> lot

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
what that does is it makes it a lot

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.400 
what that does is it makes it a lot
easier<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.670> once<00:06:06.630> again<00:06:06.720> you<00:06:06.900> don't<00:06:07.170> need

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
easier and once again you don't need

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.620 
easier and once again you don't need
multiple<00:06:07.950> versions<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.669> mods<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.450> that

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
multiple versions of the mods so that

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.159 
multiple versions of the mods so that
was<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.140> first<00:06:10.590> step<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:11.700> whole<00:06:12.169> thing

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
was the first step to this whole thing

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.990 
was the first step to this whole thing
up<00:06:13.440> but<00:06:14.070> yes<00:06:14.340> so<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.790> has<00:06:15.000> been<00:06:15.180> 12<00:06:16.020> w<00:06:16.970> 27a<00:06:17.970> i

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
up but yes so it has been 12 w 27a i
