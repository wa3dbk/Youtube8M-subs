 Well, many days have passed since then 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:44.869
 The warm spring is over and the hot summer is over 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.210
 It is cool autumn and cold winter is coming 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.680

 I will wait because I made a promise 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 Then one more year has passed since spring has become spring 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.230

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.530
 That is the time when my father and mother tried to put the sandwich in their mouth 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.020
 Little boy of turtle came out from behind the grass 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.160
