00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.010
 so next to me is probably now 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.850
 dario you had very very happy 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.080
 just done you have the 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.810
 group phase survived the second 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.990
 Mother celebrated her unbelievably 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.430
 Certainly you will receive limerick super 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.110
 probably know from the stage 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.340
 that is so celebrated is still something 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.320
 special hinders the whole German 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.180
 fans here in your homeland I'm there 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.300
 even so, after celebrating for 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.730
 me everything is relatively the same so me 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.650
 I'm happy about every one of Starcraft 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.660
 2 is thrilled and then on 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.060
 even for me, as you say 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.470
 but how often says it no idea 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.940
 Of course, that's nice, too 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.340
 germany so many people are so strong 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.600
 two movies and I think strong is 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.100
 germany will also become stronger 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 location has something to say and that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.870
 I am also very happy we have 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.610
 the games ran from your point of view, then 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
 there is now against them but in the end 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 I would have a pretty close match yes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.100
 quite under pressure as ran 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.799
 it from his point of view 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.720
 yes the first match is not 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.890
 This worked so well first 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.479
 second bad it just that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.700
 problem that he is very unpredictable 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.719
 plays and I think that's why 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.479
 the second map won that was one 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.710
 extremely funny pictures or on 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.999
 I'm done with a lot 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.100
 Confidence has gone into the match 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.289
 because my form is relatively strong and msi 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.329
 not the msi is the one in the smart front 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.979
 gave two years 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.179
 ok and now there is a player you 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.319
 you would want that for those for 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.969
 play offs or someone you 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.710
 maybe it would go out of the way 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.159
 everyone is okay except liquid 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 player 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.329
 Ok, so no matter what 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.710
 actually, if not me now 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.119
 Shoot it I want someone 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.859
 or not someone want only that there 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.880
 not so, then that would be in 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:58.130
 my head is therefore completely simple 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.109
 blind rows and I do not care 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.549
 okay, you're one of them 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.659
 players who are hardworking 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.920
 meant now I leave so the training 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.450
 the last time of the moment especially 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.000
 was your results the paid off 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.170
 miracles continuously better why it was 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.920
 yes, that's really it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.420
 so foldable on the one hand are just mine 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.200
 Hands no longer like that earlier 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.060
 I had the injury and then 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.830
 training stop 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.840
 I am also very chronic and mental 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.610
 I'll work much better sooner 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 completely nervous and so pressure 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.140
 I was there and I found out there 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 ran much more much more relaxed 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 ok then to conclude another 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 community question was asked by 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.410
 rescues usern j med 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.209
 Also a great nickname and that would be 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.739
 you better win a big one and even 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.940
 not win a big tournament and even 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.380
 no prize money 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.880
 or would you rather not win 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.830
 and for the prize money I bring 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.540
 believe the big win this 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.819
 so if it is such a big stage 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.860
 as with tree mac or pc or something would be 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.120
 the feeling to be in front and also 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.319
 that self-confidence is what you get from it 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 you get that position if 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.769
 I think that is worth more then 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.380
 times and moreover the publicity is too 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.670
 then at the end then also money is worth 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.470
 Unbelievable wings was the big tournament 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.200
 to win and not as prize money too 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.549
 I have great dario thank him 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.030
 Of course that's the time again 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.410
 took 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.120
 I do not want yours now 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.950
 Still holding off tanners 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.500
 any words to the fans or something 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 want to go out again yes thank you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.200
 you supported me as it 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.370
 not so good sooner and earlier 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.989
 I hope I finally have it again 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.150
 that I'm not always in the round of 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.100
 age stuck but that right or 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.829
 will still show and we that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.829
 also super okay thank you
