00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
this is a glitch or what but this should

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
this is a glitch or what but this should
hopefully<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.090> fixed<00:01:06.540> soon<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.960> September's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
hopefully be fixed soon as September's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.109 
hopefully be fixed soon as September's
only<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.630> week<00:01:09.630> away<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
only a week away now which is when the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.620 
only a week away now which is when the
new<00:01:12.450> OS<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:13.170> meant<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.650> released<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
new OS is meant to be released so I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
new OS is meant to be released so I
think<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.080> beta<00:01:16.470> 6<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> last<00:01:17.369> beta

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
think that beta 6 will be the last beta

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
think that beta 6 will be the last beta
azum<00:01:18.320> September's<00:01:19.320> only<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> week<00:01:19.710> away<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
azum September's only a week away and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
azum September's only a week away and
they<00:01:20.280> keep<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.640> bringing<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.090> every<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.450> weeks

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
they keep on bringing my every two weeks

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.609 
they keep on bringing my every two weeks
so<00:01:22.549> if<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:23.909> fix<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.390> glitches<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so if they fix them glitches then I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.819 
so if they fix them glitches then I
think<00:01:26.220> iOS<00:01:27.000> 5<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.810> ready<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.320> released

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
think iOS 5 will be ready to be released

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.800 
think iOS 5 will be ready to be released
to<00:01:29.100> everyone<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.939> should<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to everyone which it should be in the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.249 
to everyone which it should be in the
next<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.650> three<00:01:31.770> weeks<00:01:31.950> hopefully<00:01:33.259> some

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
next two or three weeks hopefully some

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
next two or three weeks hopefully some
people<00:01:34.619> did<00:01:34.920> say<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.369> problem<00:01:36.560> problems

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
people did say that problem problems

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.480
