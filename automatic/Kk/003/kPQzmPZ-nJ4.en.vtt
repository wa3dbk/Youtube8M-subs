nails I thought this would be really
easy<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.350> super<00:00:16.680> good<00:00:17.010> at

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
for me some of them turned out really

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.509 
for me some of them turned out really
bad<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.289> I've<00:00:22.500> been<00:00:22.650> practicing<00:00:23.340> I've

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:32.710 
higher up to give it that look that it's
fading<00:01:23.360> instead<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.689> harsh<00:01:24.960> line

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.750 

I'm<00:01:33.230> gonna<00:01:33.410> show<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:33.680> guys<00:01:33.890> two<00:01:34.250> techniques

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
I'm gonna show you guys two techniques

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.350 
I'm gonna show you guys two techniques
this<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.960> first<00:01:36.260> one<00:01:36.530> it's<00:01:36.890> my<00:01:37.700> favorite

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
this is the first one it's my favorite

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.970 
this is the first one it's my favorite
it<00:01:38.570> works<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.230> best<00:01:39.410> for<00:01:39.530> me

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
it works the best for me

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.350 
it works the best for me
but<00:01:40.280> I'll<00:01:40.400> show<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.820> other<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:41.120> too

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
but I'll show you the other one too

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.469 
but I'll show you the other one too
because<00:01:41.570> I've<00:01:41.960> seen<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> lot<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.560> people<00:01:42.800> do

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.630 

then<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.630> course<00:01:50.659> just<00:01:51.290> add<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.740> topcoat<00:01:52.010> this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
then of course just add a topcoat this

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.240 
then of course just add a topcoat this
will<00:01:52.940> actually<00:01:53.630> help<00:01:54.049> blend<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.619> together<00:01:54.770> but

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
will actually help blend it together but

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.859 
will actually help blend it together but
you<00:01:55.310> want<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.549> be<00:01:55.640> careful<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.600> don't

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
you want to be careful that you don't

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.810 
you want to be careful that you don't
accidentally<00:01:57.740> get<00:01:57.920> some<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> darker

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
accidentally get some of the darker

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.390 
accidentally get some of the darker
color<00:01:59.060> onto<00:01:59.330> your<00:01:59.659> brush<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.140> then<00:02:00.200> get<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.280> on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
color onto your brush and then get it on

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.219 
color onto your brush and then get it on
to<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.640> light<00:02:01.850> parts<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.479> did<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.810> once<00:02:03.020> and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
to the light parts I did that once and

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.620 
to the light parts I did that once and
totally<00:02:03.619> ruined<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.360> finish

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
totally ruined it and that is the finish

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.870 
totally ruined it and that is the finish
nail<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:12.950> technique<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
nail so for this technique you do the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.610 
nail so for this technique you do the
same<00:02:14.060> thing<00:02:14.360> where<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.840> paint<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> colors

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
same thing where you paint the colors

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.070 
same thing where you paint the colors
onto<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.250> sponge<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.940> actually<00:02:17.360> mix

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
onto the sponge and I actually mix

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.690 
onto the sponge and I actually mix
together<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.770> pink<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.160> white<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.580> make

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
together the pink and the white to make

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.000 
together the pink and the white to make
a<00:02:19.760> middle<00:02:20.120> color<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.600> then<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.470> dab<00:02:21.709> the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
a middle color and then you just dab the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.300 
a middle color and then you just dab the
entire<00:02:22.519> sponge<00:02:23.090> onto<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.950> repeat

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
entire sponge onto it and you repeat

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.400 
entire sponge onto it and you repeat
this<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.519> couple<00:02:25.610> times<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.390> problem<00:02:27.110> with

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
this a couple times the problem with

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.590 
this a couple times the problem with
this<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.040> for<00:02:28.940> me<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.390> was<00:02:29.570> really

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
this one is that for me it was really

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.710 
this one is that for me it was really
really<00:02:30.500> messy<00:02:31.100> but<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.970> did<00:02:32.150> turn<00:02:32.390> out<00:02:32.480> pretty

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
really messy but it did turn out pretty

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.220 
really messy but it did turn out pretty
good

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
good

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
good
the<00:02:33.620> only<00:02:33.800> problem<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.340> had<00:02:34.519> with<00:02:34.700> how<00:02:34.820> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the only problem I had with how it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.190 
the only problem I had with how it
looked<00:02:35.209> was<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.640> texture<00:02:38.120> was<00:02:38.300> weird<00:02:38.600> it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
looked was that the texture was weird it

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.949 
looked was that the texture was weird it
was<00:02:39.350> way<00:02:39.560> too<00:02:39.590> spongy<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:41.390> person<00:02:41.840> that

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
was way too spongy and in person that

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.509 
was way too spongy and in person that
looked<00:02:42.110> too<00:02:42.200> weird<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.830> camera<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.489> looks

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
looked too weird but on camera it looks

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.210 
looked too weird but on camera it looks
pretty<00:02:43.940> good<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.650> try<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.100> you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
pretty good so you can try this if you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.770 
pretty good so you can try this if you
want<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.670> would<00:02:46.760> recommend<00:02:47.239> putting<00:02:47.450> some

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
want I would recommend putting some

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.990 
want I would recommend putting some
Vaseline<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.590> taping<00:02:48.920> off<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.280> edges<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.730> your

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
Vaseline or taping off the edges of your

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
Vaseline or taping off the edges of your
nails<00:02:50.180> though

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.710 

here<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.580> outcome<00:02:55.970> when<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> use<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.540> first

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
here is the outcome when I use the first

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.380 
here is the outcome when I use the first
technique<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.950> think<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.610> looks<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.209> good

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
technique I think it looks really good

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.540 
technique I think it looks really good
and<00:02:59.450> really<00:03:00.140> clean<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.769> comparison<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
and really clean in comparison to the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.930 
and really clean in comparison to the
second<00:03:01.879> technique<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.400> technique

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
second technique so here is technique

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.630 
second technique so here is technique
number<00:03:05.209> two<00:03:05.390> finished<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.920> looks<00:03:07.129> okay

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
number two finished it looks okay

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.080 
number two finished it looks okay
although<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.450> still<00:03:09.080> pretty<00:03:09.379> messy<00:03:09.890> after<00:03:10.760> I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
although it's still pretty messy after I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.990 
although it's still pretty messy after I
tried<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.629> clean<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:13.430> kind<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.760> hard

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
tried to clean it so it's kind of hard

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.330 
tried to clean it so it's kind of hard
and<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.629> person<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.319> didn't<00:03:15.709> look<00:03:15.769> as<00:03:15.950> good<00:03:16.160> as

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
and in person it didn't look as good as

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.810 
and in person it didn't look as good as
it<00:03:16.549> does<00:03:16.640> right<00:03:16.700> now<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.360> camera
