00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.860
 they are quickly surrounding 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.070
 what's up kids here in general I 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.050
 black ops 2 for zombie mode for the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.630
 origins map and it's a very good trick very 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 easy very surprising also for 12 and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.129
 up to three players worth 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 for this trick we're going to need that 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.510
 pass the giant of half a pass spend three 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.180
 giants well let's say to need 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 the right leg of the giant's 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.400
 medium it is worth noting that we are going to have to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 be in height to jump on his leg 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.290
 Once there we will be outside the map there 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.430
 that doing a series of steps is worth it and we 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.089
 we will stand in a zombie barrier 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.909
 I say the game 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.850
 the trick is worth 1 to a maximum of 3 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.869
 because 4 I do not know if they would fit but it would be 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.189
 all prove it because I say that for those 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.710
 players because what should be done 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 It would be everyone should come here 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 ok I do not mean that one gets and 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.799
 the others are put in a place not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780
 they should all be in the same 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.000
 site all too 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.760
 is today form pretends to make history 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.970
 the case is to come here and wait for the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.549
 giant supports her paw and once supports her 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.500
 should you jump you should stick to the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.150
 wall as you see it in the video we 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.729
 will leave the map out and you have to paste two 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.130
 jumps very fast towards the towards the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.159
 final goes towards the limit because if not 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.259
 would kill us gabarre there and kill us 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.049
 completely worth it 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.630
 a lot of hurry and hit two jumps very 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.820
 very quickly one and we arrived here would have 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.740
 to bend over or lie on the ground 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 total as you see in the video we arrived 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.979
 here to the box we stand up the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 we went through we hit the wall 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.670
 completely and the zombies are us 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.740
 they accumulate just below our as 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.569
 you see in the video is very very simple 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 ok or I summarize them briefly 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.100
 you just have to be there in height 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.619
 next to the green stone how it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.269
 activates the song when the giant of 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.730
 In the middle, put your foot, you have to jump 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.800
 over stay stuck to the wall just like 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.989
 in the video if you do not know clearly repeat 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.210
 we stay there stuck in the wall and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.730
 when the giant very foot what does 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.980
 pulls us directly out of the map 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.390
 I would have to hit two jumps in a hurry 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 so that it will not kill us barrier after 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.830
 it will reach as far as you have seen 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.240
 we lay down we approached the box of 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.580
 wood and we already stand up and we 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.550
 we place value after you have seen 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.770
 also how the bonuses are taken 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.330
 rewind the video to see it well 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.420
 you just had to bend over and turn 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 to the left and already the bonus 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.500
 can be accommodated from here from the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.000
 very simple trick very easy and you are 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.630
 the trick has no more is very simple 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.060
 as I said this one is very drawing this 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.710
 trick so do not ask anything live 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.570
