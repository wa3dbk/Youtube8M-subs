00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.570
 of our revenue 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 we take out all the fats we clean 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.690
 one by one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.690
 we washed them all 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.949
 we put the vinegar and mix well 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 we put it back in the sieve to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 drain the water 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.850
 let's temper eating with tablespoon 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.290
 homemade seasoning 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 we mix well 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.960

 We're going to have to cook in the pan. 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 pressure because it is not wine is very hard 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.350
 so we'll put a sheet of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.300
 blonde to give an air a very tasty in 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.550
 our revenue 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.510
 the broth that remained on the plate under the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.280
 Hall 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.730
 we put in the pressure cooker 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.730
 because a seasoning is the money 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.170

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.079
 before opening the pressure cooker is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.120
 very dangerous to open the cover while 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.569

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.500
