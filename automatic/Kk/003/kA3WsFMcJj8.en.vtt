00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.040
 photography because actually when it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.460
 accelerate will be on January 4 I tell you what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.219
 Buenos Aires depart from here towards 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.630
 villa carlos paz then move to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.470
 San Juan and San Juan Chilecito 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.670
 they pass it to copiapó in chile 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:01.700
 on Chilean soil pass Antofagasta 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.510
 kike and there is calama to the highest 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.190
 again go through the Argentine hot springs 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.480
 from deep river 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.090
 rosario buenos aires here are in the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.920
 customs but and so they move to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.900
 technopolis where we can enjoy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.530
 of these machines are watching the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 there are really candidates of all kinds 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.120
 for the win because it seems to me that 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.880
 he's very fought in trucks very 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.080
 fought journalism in cars with cars 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.510
 official 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.090
 marc comá is going to be the great candidate in 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.150
 I think nobody always talks to you if 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.170
 it is like this 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.430
 good always predominance in the 44th cycle 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.030
 of Latinos 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.800
 what he likes but not always 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.130
 quadricycle because the predominance 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.760
 undoubtedly it is Latin American but 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.390
 French dominate vote phrase 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.390
 how we come 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 and then we'll see the car lottery 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.970
 and trucks where there 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.510
 there are so many difficult circumstances 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.239
 in an unpredictable competition that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.220
 can win any and you can climb 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.800
 to the royal podium 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.560
 in more and minds of course than those of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 tip are more candidates than those who are 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.510
 to do the tour just for pleasure 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.990
