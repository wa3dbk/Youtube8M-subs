along the natural arch of my eyebrows

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.639 
along the natural arch of my eyebrows
I'm<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.700> using<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> liner<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.960> elongate

the brows I used to use an angled brush
for<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.649> step<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.700> discovered<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
for this step with discovered that a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
for this step with discovered that a
small<00:02:01.020> eyeliner<00:02:01.680> brush<00:02:02.070> gives<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.969> more

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
small eyeliner brush gives a more

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.880 

next<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.910> will<00:02:12.060> use<00:02:12.120> concealer<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> clean<00:02:13.709> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
next we will use concealer to clean up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.699 
next we will use concealer to clean up
the<00:02:14.069> lines<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.760> seal<00:02:15.420> off<00:02:15.660> any<00:02:15.930> blank<00:02:16.470> spaces

even if you only fill in your brows with

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
even if you only fill in your brows with
powder<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.810> could<00:02:22.170> still<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.010> step<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
powder you could still do this step to

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.470 
powder you could still do this step to
create<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> very<00:02:24.510> defined<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:25.319> soft<00:02:25.709> brow<00:02:27.980> I'm
