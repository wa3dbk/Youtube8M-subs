this so you're going to do the same with
the<00:01:59.549> other<00:01:59.579> side<00:02:00.020> does<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> take<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.649> corner

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
the other side does it take this corner

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.760 
the other side does it take this corner
and<00:02:04.229> fold<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.189> back

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
and fold it back

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
and fold it back
this<00:02:07.770> doesn't<00:02:07.980> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> perfect<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
this doesn't want to be that perfect so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.540 
this doesn't want to be that perfect so
