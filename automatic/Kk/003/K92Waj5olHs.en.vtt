vsync off and eight times AAA we're

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.400 
vsync off and eight times AAA we're
going<00:00:16.299> to<00:00:16.360> start<00:00:16.600> out<00:00:16.750> by<00:00:16.930> choosing<00:00:17.199> the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
going to start out by choosing the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.349 
going to start out by choosing the
automatic<00:00:17.949> preset<00:00:18.400> which<00:00:18.699> on<00:00:19.000> this<00:00:19.119> machine

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
automatic preset which on this machine

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.260 
automatic preset which on this machine
becomes<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.050> medium<00:00:20.380> preset<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:22.090> so<00:00:22.180> you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
becomes the medium preset just so you

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.030 
becomes the medium preset just so you
guys<00:00:22.420> know<00:00:22.780> I'm<00:00:23.050> not<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.470> one<00:00:23.500> driving

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
guys know I'm not the one driving

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.950 
guys know I'm not the one driving
there's<00:00:24.460> actually<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.850> graphics<00:00:25.390> benchmark

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
there's actually a graphics benchmark

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.110 
there's actually a graphics benchmark
option<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.620> menu<00:00:26.980> which<00:00:27.490> just<00:00:27.760> sets<00:00:27.970> up

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
option in the menu which just sets up

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.060 
option in the menu which just sets up
the<00:00:28.270> same<00:00:28.450> tracking<00:00:28.780> car<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.440> has<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.890> gain

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
the same tracking car and has the gain

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.400 
the same tracking car and has the gain
race<00:00:30.280> itself<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.360> race<00:00:31.570> runs<00:00:31.869> about<00:00:32.110> two

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
race itself the race runs about two

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.260 
race itself the race runs about two
minutes<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:33.010> I<00:00:33.190> did<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.460> second<00:00:33.850> run<00:00:34.030> for<00:00:34.239> each

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
minutes and I did a second run for each

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.990 
minutes and I did a second run for each
setting<00:00:34.899> without<00:00:35.289> fraps<00:00:35.860> recording<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.850> get

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
setting without fraps recording to get

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.490 
setting without fraps recording to get
accurate<00:00:37.180> results<00:00:37.750> because<00:00:38.020> fraps<00:00:38.410> recording

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
accurate results because fraps recording

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.470 
accurate results because fraps recording
takes<00:00:38.980> about<00:00:39.130> 5<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.610> 10<00:00:39.760> frames<00:00:40.000> away<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:46.239> you

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
takes about 5 to 10 frames away as you

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.479 
takes about 5 to 10 frames away as you
can<00:00:46.630> see<00:00:46.810> on<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.110> automatic<00:00:47.530> medium<00:00:48.040> preset

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
can see on the automatic medium preset

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.700 
can see on the automatic medium preset
we're<00:00:48.880> averaging<00:00:49.030> about<00:00:49.540> 47<00:00:50.320> frames<00:00:50.500> per

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
we're averaging about 47 frames per

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.400 
we're averaging about 47 frames per
second<00:00:51.070> which<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.550> definitely<00:00:51.850> playable<00:00:52.420> next

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
second which is definitely playable next

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:23.859 
second which is definitely playable next
we're<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.680> try<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.950> high<00:00:54.190> preset

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.139 

okay<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.259> high<00:01:25.530> we're<00:01:25.829> averaging<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.520> 36

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
okay so on high we're averaging about 36

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.300 
okay so on high we're averaging about 36
frames<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.110> 10<00:01:28.409> less<00:01:28.619> than<00:01:28.649> on<00:01:28.920> medium

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
frames it's about 10 less than on medium

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
frames it's about 10 less than on medium
and<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.299> still<00:01:30.450> playable<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.470> would

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and it's still playable but I would

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
and it's still playable but I would
probably<00:01:31.799> stick<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> medium<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
probably stick to medium because it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
probably stick to medium because it
doesn't<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.899> different<00:01:35.030> okay

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
doesn't look that much different okay

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.940 
doesn't look that much different okay
now<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.539> try<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> ultra<00:01:37.320> preset

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.899 

I'm<00:01:40.950> sure<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> notice<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I'm sure you notice that I'm just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
I'm sure you notice that I'm just
showing<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> first<00:01:42.810> 20<00:01:43.229> seconds<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.679> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
showing you the first 20 seconds of the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.529 
showing you the first 20 seconds of the
race<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.189> each<00:01:44.310> setting<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.179> fair<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
race at each setting for fair and

00:01:45.539 --> 00:02:08.350 
race at each setting for fair and
consistent<00:01:45.630> results

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120 

okay<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.690> altar<00:02:10.110> we're<00:02:10.289> averaging<00:02:10.440> 20

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
okay so on altar we're averaging 20

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
okay so on altar we're averaging 20
frames<00:02:11.430> which<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.760> probably<00:02:12.300> too<00:02:12.569> low<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
frames which is probably too low to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.990 
frames which is probably too low to
enjoy<00:02:13.319> but<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> game<00:02:14.280> does<00:02:14.580> look<00:02:14.610> spectacular

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
enjoy but the game does look spectacular

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.770 
enjoy but the game does look spectacular
I<00:02:15.599> would<00:02:16.050> probably<00:02:16.230> stay<00:02:16.590> away<00:02:16.770> from<00:02:16.830> ultra

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
I would probably stay away from ultra

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:50.559 
I would probably stay away from ultra
next<00:02:18.780> we're<00:02:18.959> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> run<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.500> low<00:02:19.739> preset

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.420 

all<00:02:51.569> right<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.019> low<00:02:52.170> preset<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.890> get<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> max

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
all right on the low preset we get a max

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.350 
all right on the low preset we get a max
of<00:02:53.700> 118<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:55.110> an<00:02:55.260> average<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.709> 54<00:02:56.220> frames<00:02:56.580> so

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
of 118 with an average of 54 frames so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.630 
of 118 with an average of 54 frames so
the<00:02:57.659> game<00:02:57.840> runs<00:02:58.110> very<00:02:58.409> smooth<00:02:58.769> on<00:02:58.950> low<00:02:59.159> at<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the game runs very smooth on low at the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.130 
the game runs very smooth on low at the
cost<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.060> some<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.390> nice<00:03:00.629> graphic

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
cost of some of the nice graphic

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.890 
cost of some of the nice graphic
elements<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.360> lastly<00:03:03.360> we're<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.690> run

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
elements and lastly we're going to run

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:34.000 
elements and lastly we're going to run
in<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.140> ultra-low<00:03:04.799> preset

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.160 

okay<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.069> on<00:03:35.340> ultra-low<00:03:35.940> somehow<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.540> maximum

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
okay so on ultra-low somehow the maximum

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.410 
okay so on ultra-low somehow the maximum
frame<00:03:37.410> rate<00:03:37.470> was<00:03:37.800> less<00:03:38.040> than<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.400> low<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:39.300> it

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
frame rate was less than on low but it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.120 
frame rate was less than on low but it
doesn't<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.720> matter<00:03:39.989> too<00:03:40.200> much<00:03:40.410> we're

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
doesn't really matter too much we're

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.220 
doesn't really matter too much we're
averaging<00:03:41.220> almost<00:03:41.640> 63<00:03:42.360> frames<00:03:42.690> per<00:03:42.900> second

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
averaging almost 63 frames per second

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.750 
averaging almost 63 frames per second
which<00:03:43.349> is<00:03:43.380> very<00:03:43.739> good<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.610> game

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
which is very good but the game

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.160 
which is very good but the game
certainly<00:03:45.090> looks<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.569> it's<00:03:45.690> from<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.959> last

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
certainly looks like it's from the last

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.839 
certainly looks like it's from the last
generation<00:03:46.410> without<00:03:47.099> all<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> complex

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
generation without all of the complex

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.500 
generation without all of the complex
textures<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.180> play<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
textures so I like to play in the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.449 
textures so I like to play in the
automatic<00:03:52.050> medium<00:03:52.380> preset<00:03:52.800> because<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> game

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
automatic medium preset because the game

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.370 
automatic medium preset because the game
runs<00:03:53.700> pretty<00:03:53.940> smooth<00:03:54.300> while<00:03:54.840> looking<00:03:55.170> nice

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
runs pretty smooth while looking nice

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.080 
runs pretty smooth while looking nice
and<00:03:55.680> that's<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.400> really<00:03:56.550> ask<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:56.910> out

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and that's all I can really ask for out

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.000 
and that's all I can really ask for out
of<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.300> laptop<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.900> you're<00:03:58.560> really<00:03:58.770> anal

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
of this laptop if you're really anal

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.800 
of this laptop if you're really anal
about<00:03:59.250> getting<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.670> stable<00:04:00.120> 60<00:04:00.330> frames

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
about getting that stable 60 frames

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.540 
about getting that stable 60 frames
you'll<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.500> even<00:04:01.680> run<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.040> low<00:04:02.280> or

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
you'll have to even run it on low or

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.550 
you'll have to even run it on low or
ultra<00:04:02.910> low<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.420> try<00:04:03.930> lowering<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.470> resolution

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
ultra low or try lowering the resolution

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.710 
ultra low or try lowering the resolution
which<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.640> didn't<00:04:05.850> do<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.120> video<00:04:06.269> because

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
which I didn't do in this video because

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.050 
which I didn't do in this video because
most<00:04:07.019> people<00:04:07.260> play<00:04:07.380> at<00:04:07.500> 1080p<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.280> hope<00:04:08.940> you

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
most people play at 1080p I hope you

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.460 
most people play at 1080p I hope you
