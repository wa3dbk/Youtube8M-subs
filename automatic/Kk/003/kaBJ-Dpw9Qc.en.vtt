forward<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.529> before<00:00:30.220> we<00:00:30.369> told<00:00:30.610> you<00:00:30.789> guys<00:00:30.820> to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
forward and before we told you guys to

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.939 
forward and before we told you guys to
make<00:00:31.449> sure<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.989> it<00:00:32.079> has<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.379> ground<00:00:32.619> plug

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
make sure that it has the ground plug

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.680 
make sure that it has the ground plug
and<00:00:33.580> it<00:00:33.699> looks<00:00:33.820> like<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.090> ground<00:00:34.330> Floyd<00:00:34.570> is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
and it looks like the ground Floyd is

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.590 
and it looks like the ground Floyd is
here<00:00:34.840> Ryan<00:00:35.050> but<00:00:35.260> it's<00:00:35.379> kind<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.769> loose<00:00:36.010> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
here Ryan but it's kind of loose and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.450 
here Ryan but it's kind of loose and
this<00:00:37.600> little<00:00:37.839> mess<00:00:38.019> here<00:00:38.199> -<00:00:38.440> yeah<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.280> then

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
this little mess here - yeah and then

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.119 
this little mess here - yeah and then
somebody<00:00:40.000> has<00:00:40.180> fixed<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.720> cord<00:00:41.170> okay

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
somebody has fixed this cord okay

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.810 
somebody has fixed this cord okay
exactly<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.970> know<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.629> we<00:00:43.809> could<00:00:44.080> you<00:00:44.769> know

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
exactly I know that we could you know

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360 
exactly I know that we could you know
rewire<00:00:45.820> some<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.239> this<00:00:46.449> but<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:48.010> simple

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
rewire some of this but one simple

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.460 
rewire some of this but one simple
solution<00:00:48.519> is<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.390> cord<00:00:49.720> is<00:00:49.809> already<00:00:50.170> getting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
solution is this cord is already getting

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.189 
solution is this cord is already getting
pretty<00:00:50.500> old<00:00:50.739> as<00:00:51.129> fragile<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:52.119> stuff<00:00:52.839> well

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
pretty old as fragile and stuff well

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.469 
pretty old as fragile and stuff well

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
is okay so what we're going to do here

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.540 
is okay so what we're going to do here
is<00:01:24.070> one<00:01:24.520> wire<00:01:25.120> is<00:01:25.570> going<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.380> fuse<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
is one wire is going to the fuse the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.640 
is one wire is going to the fuse the
other<00:01:27.700> one<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.180> here<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.570> an<00:01:28.690> AC<00:01:28.900> filter

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
other one is going here to an AC filter

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.620 
other one is going here to an AC filter
then<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.370> course<00:01:30.550> your<00:01:30.700> ground<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.180> going<00:01:31.420> over

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
then of course your ground is going over

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.240 
then of course your ground is going over
there<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.320> we're<00:01:32.470> just<00:01:32.500> going<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.800> desolder

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
there so we're just going to desolder

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.940 
there so we're just going to desolder
these<00:01:33.580> wires<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.270> then<00:01:34.900> run<00:01:35.170> our<00:01:35.320> new<00:01:35.620> cord

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
these wires and then run our new cord

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.010 
these wires and then run our new cord
right<00:01:36.340> where<00:01:36.670> they're<00:01:36.850> going<00:01:42.450> okay<00:01:43.450> now<00:01:43.750> that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
right where they're going okay now that

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.930 
right where they're going okay now that
we've<00:01:44.200> got<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.680> old<00:01:44.920> wire<00:01:45.250> out<00:01:45.520> we're<00:01:45.820> going

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
we've got the old wire out we're going

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.790 
we've got the old wire out we're going
to<00:01:46.000> solder<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> new<00:01:46.960> one<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.229> exactly

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
to solder just the new one in exactly

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.740 
to solder just the new one in exactly
where<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.130> old<00:01:48.280> one<00:01:48.430> was<00:01:51.210> okay<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.270> quite

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750

simply all we did was we D soldered out
the<00:01:55.390> old<00:01:55.570> cord<00:01:55.930> totally<00:01:56.800> removed<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.520> then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
the old cord totally removed it and then

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.030 
the old cord totally removed it and then
put<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> new<00:01:58.570> cord<00:01:58.900> soldered<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.590> right<00:01:59.830> back

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
put the new cord soldered it right back

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.490 
put the new cord soldered it right back
