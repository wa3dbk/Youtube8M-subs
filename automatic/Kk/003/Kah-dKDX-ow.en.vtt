00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.929
 surprisingly presented last e3 for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 xbox 360 xbox one and lace comes 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.039
 finally plants vs zombies gunkel 100 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.189
 a revisiting in key shooter in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.460
 third person of the touch masterpiece of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.289
 note software house we do not deny that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.840
 like many at the announcement of this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.030
 we expected a change of course 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 a rather strange creature indeed not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.080
 trusting us to abandon the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.480
 tower defense setup of 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 instead the classic has the result 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080
 surprised 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 since its debut in 2009 plains versus 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.910
 zombies and still considered one today 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 more vibrant tower defense systems accessible 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 and fun 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.040
 Success is also about the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 funny and charismatic characters 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.550
 hold back plants and wacky not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 over the years the series arrived up 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.869
 handheld smartphone console saw 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.729
 a spin off on facebook and in more times 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.640
 recent I have followed up on 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.440
 mobile devices and tablet plans versus 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 In short, zombies is one of 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.580
 most successful popcap games e 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 now goes to get rich with garden 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 warfare an atypical episode because 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.369
 takes up the world and the ideas of the chapters 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.840
 previous repeats in a shooter 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.840
 competitive online 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.970
 from the beginning we are presented with one 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.280
 important choice or you want to do the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.470
 plants you want to make zombies at the beginning 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.930
 you probably choose what we do 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.120
 he is more sympathetic but be careful because 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 in reality it is an important choice that 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:07.400
 radically changes the approach to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:09.350
 gameplay in garden warfare each class 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120
 enjoys a basic attack is three moves 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.380
 special usable on the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.760
 time intervals 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.770
 a factor that makes their activation 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.420
 pleasantly planned and pressing the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.800
 player capable of waiting for the moment 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.600
 quite right 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 it goes from the classic assaultors to the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.980
 doctors from snipers to slow giants but 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
 devastating each combined with gameplay 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 personal and unique but each class 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.890
 play an important role in 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.480
 there are team balancing 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 some that alone seem capable of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.500
 making massacres the chopper for example can 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.720
 halve the opposing ranks with a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 painstaking work on the hips eating 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.960
 the zombies that venture onto the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.850
 perimeter of the battlefield while 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.440
 the engineer can exploit the damage to 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.140
 area of ​​his grenade launcher to thin out 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 the small groups of enemies 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.080
 the impression is that in general the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.850
 developers have managed to maintain 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.070
 a certain fidelity as much as possible 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.989
 to the gameplay of the original titles with 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.780
 plants in a more defensive role and the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.400
 most skilled zombies in the attack this yes 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.950
 also sees from the game mode more 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 funny granny gray diaz asking 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.580
 to vegetables to defend points of 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.780
 control and the undead to capture them 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.850
 within a time limit 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.260
 plant defense comes 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.269
 benefited by the possibility of 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.070
 place defensive turrets near 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.290
 some jars scattered around the points 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.390
 control but that's where it comes into play 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.800
 the engineer a zombie capable of 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.959
 activate teleporters for the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.000
 own team has the garden option 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.280
 singh radial joins a whole series 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.320
 there is more or less traditional methods 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.820
 the inevitable training to do 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.170
 practice with the various units 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.820
 there is team deathmatch but 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.130
 above all there is the cooperative mode 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.930
 garden ops which is the one that is the most 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.239
 approaches the original chapters of the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.920
 series 4 players take the role of 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.420
 as many plants are prepared to 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.910
 defend your garden from 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.500
 endless waves of zombies gradually 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.569
 face increasingly large groups e 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.280
 resistant with days of armor 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.850
 mini bosses and special enemies from 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.830
 face up to 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.300
 the group the choice of classes yes 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.980
 therefore it reveals the need for good 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.630
 success of the adventure as well as 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.820
 fundamental and the use of turrets e 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.380
 healing sunflowers thanks to money 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.850
 accumulated playing you can 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.130
 buy paper bags that 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.630
 allow you to unlock items 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.340
 consumables small customizations e 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.140
 real special versions of the classes 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.470
 existing each with skill 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.470
 details 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.160
 from a technical point of view one cannot 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.080
 sure to say that the game exploits up 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.270
 to the last tip the power of xbox one 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.130
 or new consoles, however, in the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.360
 we found ourselves more excited than 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.530
 face something very very 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.530
 nice to see 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.000
 in addition to the realization of maps well 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.560
 work built and visually rich 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.300
 of the developers focused 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.979
 especially on the aesthetic aspect of 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.780
 zombies and plants for the first time 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.490
 represented in 3d 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.530
 the characters are indeed animated with 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.020
 much care and made even more vivid 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.520
 apt chromatic choices despite being 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.949
 limited interaction with the environment 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.569
 allows to dirty walls destroy 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.099
 some object here and there and see gods 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.969
 roll barrels thanks to a good one 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.969
 physics management 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.530
 there is the atmosphere true to the originals 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.479
 there is fun gameplay and there are 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.849
 eight well-made classes and each one 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.169
 very different from other garden warfare 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.789
 has all the papers in order for 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.830
 become a small phenomenon between 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.630
 microsoft and pc console 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.069
 it is true that the classes suffer from reading 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.960
 imbalance is that the offer in 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.220
 terms of maps and game modes not 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.530
 it's so broad for a title 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.720
 exclusively multiplayer but the game 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.610
 of popcap is able to conquer both 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.229
 the competitive shooter enthusiast 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.789
 that the neophyte thanks to his 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.789
 accessibility and immediacy 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.370
 in short, as revenge he was a bit skeptical 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.199
 for this plants vs zombies recommended 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.949
 for happy with the arrival in English but 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:30.150
 the result that surprised us 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.150
 let's see how polite it is 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:08.400
 presented surprisingly from the beginning there 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:10.440
 presents a why if you want blue for me 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.060
 I know I don't hurt to know that 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.320
 I had despaired because I'm not mistaken 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.940
 never never know that my loved ones 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.060
 fundamentals this greeting to all 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.060
 friends
