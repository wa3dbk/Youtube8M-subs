00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.519
 the seven little things you do not know 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.260
 About the call of advanced advanced 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.139
 warfighter well I have compiled a 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.110
 details information series either 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.180
 you expect very incredible things that 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.279
 you say ostias everything I knew and I will 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.869
 change the game totally no it's not that 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.640
 but yes that are some of the things 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.439
 they very very interesting 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.170
 I tried that most are so 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.119
 curious that even if you're watching this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.789
 video when the game has already left 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.380
 even if you do not know, there are some that 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.820
 Obviously when he leaves the game he 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.410
 they will know if they are true or not good 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.730
 these are confirmed are all true 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.770
 but good when the game comes out 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.840
 people will know it already but most 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.520
 having not yet left the game people 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.629
 you will not even notice them and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.180
 I tell you , they are quite interesting 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.039
 so background friend gameplays 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.539
 black once again rendered cadal in 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.760
 description happen because this guy told me 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.530
 is giving my life leaving me gameplays 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.989
 from here I send a big hug a 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.059
 greeting and thanks so guys 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.620
 we go there with the 7 things that you do not know 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.510
 of the call of duty atanés warfare a lo 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.120
 better some you know it's worth but good 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.830
 Nor do not be let into account 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.570
 there are very interesting things like 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.300
 I say and we start with the first 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.150
 Obviously that says well in this game 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.409
 There are two types of heat market for 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.479
 people who do not know what the heat is 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.670
 I quickly explain it to you when 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.910
 you are firing an enemy comes out a 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.950
 indicator some blades we could say well 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.990
 as four opposing lines that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 show that you are giving to that 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.920
 man that when you give an uncle you 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.740
 those blades come out and you say ah, it's worth it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.630
 I'm hitting this good man 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.850
 that is walking around here as it turns out 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.040
 guys that in this game we have two 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.200
 types of jeep market two types of 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.060
 impacts two types of blades as you want 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.039
 call it I have prepared here a mini clip 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.960
 so you can see clearly in this 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.970
 first click you are going to see the heat market 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.800
 that we all know about call of duty the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.210
 of all life as you read and normal 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.340
 nothing is firing now it's going to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 load this shield well there 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.310
 finished with him and now look at this 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.920
 clip as when shooting you look just two 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.229
 aspas is like a double hit market this 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.720
 jump when you're hitting the head 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.000
 and you see the little medallion in the head 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.610
 confirming then that it has given you 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.260
 in the head it seems very good to me 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.500
 idea that they have incorporated 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.790
 as an indicator of when you're giving 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 in the head because so I know 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.790
 you can have more precision or you can be 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 aware that you are giving in the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.680
 head are you doing more harm a good 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.280
 point in favor of this game that little 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.989
 detail we go to the next point that 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.849
 maybe you do not know maybe yes but I think 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.709
 that you do not know either, it turns out that with the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.019
 red dot sight this game fijaros 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.420
 here when we target an enemy it 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.250
 they put the edges in red like a 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.829
 kind of sensor that is indicating you 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.930
 that you have in the peephole the enemy here 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.519
 you see another clip how is the red 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 edges and there it kills it and already it becomes 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.799
 neutral white and it turns out that when 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.750
 you target the allies it turns blue is 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.069
 this what more curious thing those little ones 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.019
 details that in the end you think about 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.670
 in them says ostia because they are fucking 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.920
 mother this that I am going to comment now 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.859
 very sure that practically no one 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.150
 know and you're going to be pretty 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.980
 stupefied they like you to be seen 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.049
 my analysis videos of all these 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.760
 that specifically raised in which 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.220
 explained the exo skills of this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.420
 game if you remember there was acute not me 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.699
 I agree your name now in English 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.330
 forgive me but it turns out that 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.790
 generate 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.770
 it's life above the levels 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.940
 normal of what a soldier generates is 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.700
 say that for a limited time that 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.710
 you had that sexuality you had more 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.720
 life than normal because this is going to give 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.700
 much game because it turns out that with 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.620
 this former skill activated you can 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
 survive a melee attack 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.180
 of this we could not get 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.500
 no clip of how good it looks 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.360
 There is sticking with his forearm as he 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.460
 I say in this game he stabbing this 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.530
 game and survive but if I could 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.290
 get gameplay guys little bone 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.470
 clip of one that a guy on and of two 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.180
 shots of sniper set here as it has 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.150
 that former skill with the titan species 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.580
 of analgesic and survives two shots of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.680
 sniper this the truth let's say that I 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.190
 He left a little freaked when he video 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.230
 madryn ya kike and former obliged more città di 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.790
 Sima Truth or not killing you attack 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.390
 melee and two shots with the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.830
 sniper survive awesome 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.630
 we move on to the next number 14 is 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.000
 that in this game I do not know if you have 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.440
 fixed but what is the fidh of killing 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.419
 what is below to the left that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.290
 reflects both the death losses of your 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.270
 team like 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.340
 of the enemy with yours those of all the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.430
 world does not generally turn out that in this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.350
 game is extremely long lengthy 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.760
 look at this black clip that goes here 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.620
 with the sniper kills this and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.660
 look at his blue name that he just 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.760
 go out in the fit to fix the time that goes 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.650
 to take three to appear is one thing 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.060
 as well as eight or ten seconds still 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.590
 still there in the first place not even 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
 has blurred and now practically 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.250
 is in the end that still follows 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.320
 leaving because they have already killed enough 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.530
 the enemies have already seen the time 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.650
 it takes to disappear the afip this goes 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.140
 to suppose that it is to draw one which he cited or 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.150
 something like that even in oil 5 be bread 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.950
 eaten and the standards for 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.450
 mounts and such is going to make people 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.770
 set much less in faith and what 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.660
 better much more in the skill that 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.980
 the player shows a thing too 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.110
 quite curious that I wanted to comment 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.660
 because I know a lot of people do not know 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.370
 we went to the next point number 5 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.280
 many people believe that in this game there 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.690
 there is uve sat totally lie you remember 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.570
 that then putting a lot of 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.280
 customization possibilities but a 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.710
 lots as it turns out that from the ub 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.930
 obviously increasing the points 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.590
 what is worth getting and personalizing 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.080
 It can 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.450
 a bone putting whatever is constant 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.640
 putting what the address shows 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.470
 of what the enemies are at the end you're going 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.140
 to have a clouds so like in 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.970
 white these guys in this game are you going to 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.500
 be possible to get the esat look 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.270
 provital camejo is called another way 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.430
 but I say vital actor because you know 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.590
 perfectly what I mean 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.180
 we went to number 6 one thing too 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.650
 quite curious one thing that should 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.690
 have done a long time ago and is that in 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.100
 extreme modes of this game if 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.170
 remember in the previous call of duty 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.850
 you shoot you go to an enemy and kill him 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.890
 you go until you kill you go to three or over there 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.410
 and they threw you out of the game because it turns out 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.180
 that in this extreme color I 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.650
 advanced warfare you are not going to fuck your 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.510
 comrades the damage you do to the 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.030
 enemies will be transmitted to you 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.100
 even reaching the point of committing suicide 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.990
 obviously so stop fucking 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.360
 gusts of nuclear and shit sticking 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.310
 from a shot by mistake the guy who sticks the 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.250
 mistakenly shot as he got off the 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.440
 same a great detail and also a point 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.050
 in favor of this case what is the 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.220
 end of this game and finally we go 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.810
 to talk a little about the elements 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.120
 dynamic maps you already know that 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.740
 goes let's say he made an attempt to 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.330
 put these elements on 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.849
 the extraction map that with which 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.319
 because it destroys everything 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.539
 graphic elements like falling 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.400
 trunks nonsense like those in this 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.199
 game the most we 've seen of 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.940
 dynamic element has been on the map of 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.190
 defend that it is a dynamic element 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.990
 quite important quite striking to 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.060
 I honestly these things I do not like 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.710
 on maps things that move and such 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.600
 I am more than static maps 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.060
 sincerely but he was asked 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.560
 to the co-founder that if this was going to be for 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.390
 example the tsunami that if it's going to be 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.920
 same time in all the games that 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.930
 was going to be able to activate with a kind 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.790
 of streak and the computer says that 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.350
 it depends on the map that can be there 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.350
 some that are achieved by gusts 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.390
 others occur at the same time 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.950
 I think it's going to be the case of the tsunami and 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.320
 so it's easy for players 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.600
 predict it and other maps where 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.280
 are the two possibilities that occur 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.530
 always at the same time and that also 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.180
 you can get them with gusts so 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.220
 nothing guys this has been the video of the 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.810
 7 things you do not know about the jute color 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.700
 atanés warfare honestly I would like 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.350
 that you leave me your opinion in the 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.960
 comments which has called you most the 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.000
 attention and if you knew all of them if not 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.860
 you knew none if you knew four but 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.750
 the other three do not let me all 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.850
 comments other of the video I like 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.540
