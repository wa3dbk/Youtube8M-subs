00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.330
 [Music] 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.860
 how to be alive welcome to a new 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.510
 channel chapter 8 today we have a 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.459
 very particular chapter we have talked 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.289
 a lot of the video of the image but today 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.060
 I'll be talking about the audio we're going to 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.150
 be making this microphone the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.830
 vary from technical audio very well inside 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.420
 from the box we can find the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.520
 different articles that allow us 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.619
 make this microphone work 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.360
 best possible way and let's start 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.280
 with what is usually called a 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.870
 dog this is also called clip of 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.399
 grip and it serves to maintain the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 microphone gripped to clothes too 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.679
 we have a small battery used in 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.740
 watches frequently and an adapter 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.720
 mini plan to plan 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.280
 we also have the microphone here 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.620
 capacitor that is a very microphone 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.780
 delicate and very good too and the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.340
 small container where they are 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.740
 the connections and we can also insert 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.290
 the battery to make it work has 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.060
 a switch on and off and the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.560
 another side a mini that serves us to 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.240
 connect it either a camera a 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.640
 computer to a sound table or in 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.380
 this case to the mini plan adapter to 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.360
 plan also comes with a small 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.700
 sponge that is very useful as it serves 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.560
 as anti pop does not allow the wind 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.300
 impact on the microphone and generate those 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.220
 Annoying noises and only inserts 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.940
 with pressure we are going to correct the focus a 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 little there and we put it around 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.979
 our condenser microphone once 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.260
 ready this microphone we grab our 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.180
 hook dog and we add the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.119
 top-down microphone to 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 avoid having unnecessary pressure 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.500
 and our microphone is ready to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 place on any item of clothing 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.130
 we open the small container that comes 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.050
 to insert the battery and we 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.090
 we found some connections from 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.040
 microphone on one side and on the other side the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 small space that you have ready to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.840
 locate the battery we place it exercising 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.729
 a small pressure 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.850
 also using peoples in a way 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.310
 we close the container so that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 Be firm and secure and we can already 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 turn on our microphone and use it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.530
 without any problem 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.180
 I do not know if you have noticed but during 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.950
 the previous chapters of the channel the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.680
 voice in the presentations is always 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.879
 set the rest of the voice of the aero 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.220
 with a separate microphone that's why it 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.319
 listen better to avoid that I acquired 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 this microphone the bayer that is the one that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.670
 hook on shirts or shirts and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.200
 now let's talk the difference between 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.720
 the audio you are listening to and the audio 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.370
 used with this microphone 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.260
 well I'm recording in this case with the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.720
 sony bloggie we did the review in a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.769
 previous program and the wide angle that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.709
 we add it to see better 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.239
 we take the mini plan open the space 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.840
 located in the camera to insert the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.910
 microphone and we connect it without problem 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.130
 exerting pressure in this case I'm 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.900
 illuminating and recording with one hand and with 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.540
 the other connecting the microphone so 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280
 the triton we put the microphone and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.819
 turn it on let's hear the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.819
 difference 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.760
 hello hello hello hello hello hello hello 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.530
 Hello 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.939
 very good now if we can hear the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.200
 difference with the presentation of the day 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.849
 today we made the presentation with the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.860
 integrated microphone that is a microphone 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.720
 environmental omnidirectional can 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.370
 listen to the presentation how to do 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.500
 videos and measured to a new chapter of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.849
 channel 8 and now clearly you notice the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.680
 difference with this microphone in the va 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.299
 Technical audio leader is a product 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 that will professionalize them much more 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.870
 his audiovisual productions so 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.310
 I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.050
 said goodbye to the tip of the day should 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.000
 [Music] 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.880
 directly from india they came to me 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.830
 these two packages inside we can 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.420
 find a lens for the area and blog and 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.550
 a camera that we reviewed in one of the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.170
 previous programs a camera that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.330
 It has good quality that is very useful for 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.600
 elements made on the internet but the 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.700
 lens is too angular the range 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.870
 image is not good and that's why we're going to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.370
 add this fish eye or wide angle 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.620
 here we have specifically a great 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.390
 angular and in the other bag that we brought 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.900
 directly from ebay we can 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.490
 find the fisheye lens this lens 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.530
 it will help us to increase much more 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.000
 the range of vision and later what 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.670
 we are going to be testing and showing them to 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.400
 you how the lens works comes with 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.950
 a small magnetized grip that we 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.150
 allows not only to add it to a camera 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.620
 like the bloggie but also to 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.040
 any cell phone this little ring 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.739
 comes with a white paper that is removed and 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.710
 has double sided glue tape 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.350
 both sides that we take our 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.600
 lens we stick the lens me here I already have 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.340
 one stuck by that moves so much what 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.850
 we paste in that sector and our lens 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.230
 remains 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.680
 100% magnetized 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.420
 to the angular there we see how it sticks without 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.560
 no problem and we can change the 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.600
 movement of the talk and as always 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 It also comes with a small cap and a 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.200
 magnet that allows us to protect it for 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.200
 that is not scratched let's see how it works 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.610
 compare 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.980
 a greeting 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.680
 Hello 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.220
 if not 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.220

 [Applause] 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.120
 two 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.480
 with my hand 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.310
 good 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.430

 [Applause] 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:06.250
 because the wide-angle and now we're going like this 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.550
 [Music] 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.550
 wide angle 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.279
 tight 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.220
 and there we go the two complete houses 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.900
 Y 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.230
 our faces and now again you see 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.379
 this 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.379
 [Music] 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.350
