hi<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.110> Sean<00:00:01.439> in<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.860> video<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.340> gonna

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi this is Sean in this video I'm gonna

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.920 
hi this is Sean in this video I'm gonna
go<00:00:02.730> over<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> get<00:00:03.870> these<00:00:04.080> arms<00:00:04.650> moving<00:00:05.930> in

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
go over how to get these arms moving in

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.919 
go over how to get these arms moving in
a<00:00:07.109> nice<00:00:07.290> dynamic<00:00:07.890> way<00:00:08.040> using<00:00:08.460> hair<00:00:08.790> curves<00:00:09.150> so

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
a nice dynamic way using hair curves so

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.270 
a nice dynamic way using hair curves so
first<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.620> all<00:00:10.679> let's<00:00:10.889> get<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.219> thing

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
first of all let's get this thing

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
first of all let's get this thing
aligned<00:00:11.849> back<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.759> its<00:00:14.910> tentacles

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
aligned back up on the so its tentacles

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630 
aligned back up on the so its tentacles
are<00:00:15.929> right<00:00:16.109> along<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> axis<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.400> need<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
are right along the axis so we need to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.470 
are right along the axis so we need to
go<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.439> rotate<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> y<00:00:20.480> 22.5

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
go in and rotate it on the y 22.5

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.250 
go in and rotate it on the y 22.5
degrees<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.550> I'm<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.789> gonna<00:00:23.939> start<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.660> on

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
degrees and I'm just gonna start off on

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.790 
degrees and I'm just gonna start off on
this<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.580> we'll<00:00:27.180> create<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.779> CV<00:00:28.590> curve

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
this and we'll create a CV curve

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
this and we'll create a CV curve
snapping<00:00:31.800> along<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.520> grid<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:38.399> by<00:00:39.180> making

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
snapping along the grid and by making

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.229 
snapping along the grid and by making
these<00:00:39.809> arms<00:00:40.410> exactly<00:00:40.950> ten<00:00:41.250> units<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.910> really

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
these arms exactly ten units it's really

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.619 
these arms exactly ten units it's really
easy<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.739> make<00:00:43.739> sure<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.430> control<00:00:45.180> points

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
easy to make sure that my control points

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.799 
easy to make sure that my control points
are<00:00:46.039> right<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> area<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.660> there's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
are right at the area where there's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.470 
are right at the area where there's
geometry<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> deform<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.090> also

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
geometry for it to deform so that's also

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
geometry for it to deform so that's also
worth<00:00:51.660> noting<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.520> gonna<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.090> other

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
worth noting and I'm gonna the other

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.979 
worth noting and I'm gonna the other
thing<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> nudge<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:56.989> control

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
thing is I want to nudge that control

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.240 
thing is I want to nudge that control
that<00:00:58.320> curve<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> center<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> arm

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
that curve into the center of the arm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
that curve into the center of the arm
and<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.920> duplicate

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and so now I want to get duplicate

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.750 
and so now I want to get duplicate
special<00:01:05.460> those<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.119> curve<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> edit

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
special those that curve and so edit

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560 
special those that curve and so edit
duplicate<00:01:09.270> special<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.760> we<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
duplicate special and we want it to be

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
duplicate special and we want it to be
40<00:01:13.110> every<00:01:13.350> 45<00:01:13.770> degrees<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.090> seven

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
40 every 45 degrees and we want seven

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.109 
40 every 45 degrees and we want seven
just<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.229> did<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> arms<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.939> gonna

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
just like we did with the arms I'm gonna

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.340 
just like we did with the arms I'm gonna
hit<00:01:18.509> apply<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.509> middle<00:01:22.170> Mouse

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hit apply so now I'm gonna middle Mouse

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
hit apply so now I'm gonna middle Mouse
drag<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:23.070> into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> group<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> we'll<00:01:24.420> call

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
drag this into the group and we'll call

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
drag this into the group and we'll call
this<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.610> octo<00:01:27.619> soul<00:01:28.619> curves<00:01:31.400> great<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this like octo soul curves great and we

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.140 
this like octo soul curves great and we
want<00:01:32.909> those<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:34.560> dynamic<00:01:35.310> hair<00:01:35.850> curves

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
want those to be in dynamic hair curves

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.539 
want those to be in dynamic hair curves
so<00:01:36.810> under<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> end<00:01:38.060> dynamics<00:01:39.060> tab<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.549> hair

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so under the end dynamics tab and hair

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.410 
so under the end dynamics tab and hair
we<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.540> those<00:01:42.810> curves<00:01:43.320> dynamic<00:01:44.420> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
we want to make those curves dynamic so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
we want to make those curves dynamic so
as<00:01:45.750> opposed<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.950> other<00:01:47.070> process<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
as opposed to the other process which is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
as opposed to the other process which is
just<00:01:48.329> creating<00:01:48.600> hair<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.350> we'll<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.490> down

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just creating hair so we'll look down

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.319 
just creating hair so we'll look down
here<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> say<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.840> dynamic<00:01:52.640> make<00:01:53.640> selected

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
here and say make dynamic make selected

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.959 
here and say make dynamic make selected
curves<00:01:54.600> dynamic<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.490> we've<00:01:56.759> done

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
curves dynamic so now that we've done

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
curves dynamic so now that we've done
that<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> test<00:01:58.469> play<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> looks<00:01:59.490> like

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that we do a test play and it looks like

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
that we do a test play and it looks like
there<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.380> attached<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:03.450> start<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
there are attached the the start and the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840 
there are attached the the start and the
end<00:02:04.350> depending<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> created<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
end depending on how you created the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.350 
end depending on how you created the
curve<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.570> how<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.899> declared<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:09.090> let's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
curve that's how it's declared so let's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.080 
curve that's how it's declared so let's
find<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.810> where<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.080> parameter<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
find out where that parameter is

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.410 
find out where that parameter is
in<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:15.099> it's<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> follicles

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
in the and it's really in the follicles

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.800 
in the and it's really in the follicles
so<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:20.590> open<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.580> octo<00:02:22.120> control<00:02:22.599> curves

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
so if we open up the octo control curves

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.000 
so if we open up the octo control curves
now<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.260> see<00:02:23.500> we've<00:02:23.650> got<00:02:23.680> all<00:02:23.890> these

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
now you can see we've got all these

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.300 
now you can see we've got all these
follicles<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.319> now<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.770> want<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.069> look

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
follicles and so now if we want to look

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.820 
follicles and so now if we want to look
in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.120> follicle<00:02:28.450> shape<00:02:29.080> I'm<00:02:29.349> just<00:02:29.380> selecting

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
in the follicle shape I'm just selecting

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.210 
in the follicle shape I'm just selecting
all<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> these<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.569> follicle<00:02:32.560> shape

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
all of these in the follicle shape

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.630 
all of these in the follicle shape
there's<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.630> specifies<00:02:35.349> how<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.190> attached

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
there's it specifies how it's attached

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.780 
there's it specifies how it's attached
by<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.120> point<00:02:37.569> lock<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.950> by<00:02:39.099> default<00:02:39.160> set

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
by the point lock so it's by default set

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.699 
by the point lock so it's by default set
to<00:02:39.849> both<00:02:40.150> ends<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:40.630> really<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:41.110> want<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.410> just

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
to both ends but really we want to just

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.199 
to both ends but really we want to just
to<00:02:41.860> make<00:02:41.890> sure<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.400> attached<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> base

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
to make sure it's attached at the base

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.130 
to make sure it's attached at the base
so<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.600> will<00:02:46.750> free<00:02:47.080> up<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.940> end<00:02:49.150> here<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.810> so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
so it will free up the end here and so

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.380 
so it will free up the end here and so
now<00:02:50.170> we<00:02:50.319> can<00:02:50.530> see<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.850> curves<00:02:52.150> are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
now we can see the the curves are

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.809 
now we can see the the curves are
swinging<00:02:52.720> free<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:54.010> they're<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.250> deforming

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
swinging free but they're not deforming

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.100 
swinging free but they're not deforming
the<00:02:54.850> arms<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.450> that's<00:02:55.510> one<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.959> things

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
the arms and that's one of the things

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.809 
the arms and that's one of the things
that<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.380> want<00:02:56.620> next<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.400> need<00:03:00.640> to

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
that we want next so so we need to

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.600 
that we want next so so we need to
figure<00:03:01.810> out<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.080> way<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.319> will<00:03:02.890> allow<00:03:02.920> wires

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
figure out a way that will allow wires

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.229 
figure out a way that will allow wires
to<00:03:04.209> deform<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.989> topology<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.069> that's<00:03:06.880> under

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
to deform this topology and that's under

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.259 
to deform this topology and that's under
the<00:03:07.330> animation<00:03:07.900> set<00:03:08.739> here<00:03:09.190> under<00:03:09.970> create

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
the animation set here under create

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.330 
the animation set here under create
deformers<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:12.250> want<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.670> wire<00:03:13.239> tool<00:03:13.630> and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
deformers and we want the wire tool and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.150 
deformers and we want the wire tool and
so<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:16.209> we<00:03:16.480> go<00:03:16.599> create<00:03:16.840> deformers<00:03:17.200> while<00:03:17.680> we're

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
so if we go create deformers while we're

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.500 
so if we go create deformers while we're
to<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.760> ask<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.959> select<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.709> shape

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
to a little ask you to select the shape

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.390 
to a little ask you to select the shape
to<00:03:22.510> deform<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.049> press<00:03:23.290> Enter<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:23.829> we<00:03:23.920> want<00:03:24.130> to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
to deform and press Enter so we want to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.360 
to deform and press Enter so we want to
select<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.090> ISIS<00:03:25.720> geometry<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.799> hit<00:03:26.950> enter

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
select the ISIS geometry and hit enter

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.140 
select the ISIS geometry and hit enter
and<00:03:28.319> now<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.500> says<00:03:29.709> select<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.250> curves<00:03:30.819> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and now it says select the curves that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.599 
and now it says select the curves that
you<00:03:31.420> want<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.140> deform<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.739> with<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> hair

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
you want to deform it with so the hair

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.759 
you want to deform it with so the hair
system<00:03:34.030> output<00:03:34.630> curves<00:03:35.049> is<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:35.620> you're

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
system output curves is what you're

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.099 
system output curves is what you're
looking<00:03:35.950> for<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.239> I'm<00:03:37.299> going<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.480> shift<00:03:37.750> select

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
looking for so I'm going to shift select

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.520 
looking for so I'm going to shift select
these<00:03:38.319> curves<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.130> hit<00:03:39.609> enter<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:41.170> if

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
these curves and hit enter and so now if

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.949 
these curves and hit enter and so now if
we<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> test<00:03:42.639> we<00:03:43.120> should<00:03:43.299> we<00:03:43.450> should<00:03:43.750> be<00:03:43.900> able

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
we do a test we should we should be able

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.470 
we do a test we should we should be able
to<00:03:44.079> see<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:46.049> geometry<00:03:47.049> is<00:03:47.760> playing<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.060> it's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
to see the geometry is playing and it's

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.289 
to see the geometry is playing and it's
looking<00:03:49.720> good<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:51.549> I'm<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:53.940> yeah<00:03:54.940> he's

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
looking good so I'm going to yeah he's

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.680 
looking good so I'm going to yeah he's
looking<00:03:55.720> pretty<00:03:55.750> nice<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:58.209> else<00:03:58.359> can<00:03:58.569> we

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
looking pretty nice so what else can we

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.479 
looking pretty nice so what else can we
do<00:03:58.840> now<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.049> we've<00:03:59.470> got<00:03:59.680> this<00:03:59.859> all<00:04:00.100> up<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
do now that we've got this all up and

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.930 
do now that we've got this all up and
running<00:04:00.579> well<00:04:01.480> we<00:04:01.840> want<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.230> add<00:04:02.980> some<00:04:03.459> nice

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
running well we want to add some nice

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.849 
running well we want to add some nice
movement<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.780> we<00:04:04.870> also<00:04:05.019> want<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.350> stop<00:04:05.620> these

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
movement and we also want to stop these

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.470 
movement and we also want to stop these
from<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:07.269> geometry<00:04:07.780> from<00:04:07.930> interpenetrating

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
from the geometry from interpenetrating

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.129 
from the geometry from interpenetrating
so<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.690> really<00:04:10.959> in<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.870> some<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:14.019> the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
so that's really in the in some of the

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.370 
so that's really in the in some of the
parameters<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.920> hair<00:04:15.130> system<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:16.690> can

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.610 

adjust

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
adjust

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.970 
adjust
let's<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.770> open<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.130> up<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> we're<00:04:25.530> looking

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
let's just open this up so we're looking

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.610 
let's just open this up so we're looking
in<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.510> hair<00:04:27.510> system<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.140> let's<00:04:28.350> just<00:04:28.500> look

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
in the hair system and let's just look

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.670 
in the hair system and let's just look
at<00:04:28.770> like<00:04:28.980> all<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.850> these<00:04:30.650> attributes<00:04:32.030> for<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
at like all of these attributes for the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.350 
at like all of these attributes for the
for<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.860> shape<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.520> let's<00:04:35.730> close<00:04:36.000> some<00:04:36.330> of

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
for the shape and let's close some of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.220 
for the shape and let's close some of
these<00:04:36.480> windows<00:04:36.540> here<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.810> first<00:04:43.050> one

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
these windows here so the the first one

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.350 
these windows here so the the first one
might<00:04:43.440> be<00:04:43.590> collisions<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.580> look<00:04:44.820> at<00:04:45.030> and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
might be collisions that you look at and

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.200 
might be collisions that you look at and
so<00:04:47.900> really<00:04:48.900> we<00:04:49.200> want<00:04:49.410> these<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:50.370> collide<00:04:50.880> with

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
so really we want these to collide with

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.480 
so really we want these to collide with
other<00:04:51.420> dynamic<00:04:52.290> objects<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:52.920> we<00:04:52.950> also<00:04:53.190> want

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
other dynamic objects but we also want

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.410 
other dynamic objects but we also want
them<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.640> self<00:04:54.030> collide<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:55.040> we<00:04:56.040> can<00:04:56.420> adjust

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
them to self collide and we can adjust

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.410 
them to self collide and we can adjust
the<00:04:57.900> collision<00:04:58.860> with<00:04:59.100> offset<00:04:59.760> just<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.180> little

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
the collision with offset just a little

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.240 
the collision with offset just a little
bit<00:05:00.540> because<00:05:00.660> riot<00:05:00.930> default<00:05:01.410> we've<00:05:01.950> got<00:05:02.100> this

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
bit because riot default we've got this

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.240 
bit because riot default we've got this
thick<00:05:02.700> piece<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.180> geometry<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:04.110> we<00:05:04.140> want<00:05:05.130> to

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
thick piece of geometry and we want to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.910 
thick piece of geometry and we want to
just<00:05:05.520> make<00:05:05.880> sure<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.090> there's<00:05:06.510> some<00:05:07.320> offset

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
just make sure that there's some offset

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.780 
just make sure that there's some offset
between<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:09.600> collisions<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:10.980> now<00:05:11.160> that

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
between the collisions and so now that

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.970 
between the collisions and so now that
looks<00:05:12.000> like<00:05:12.540> I<00:05:12.660> nailed<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.390> that's<00:05:15.390> good<00:05:15.980> we

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
looks like I nailed it so that's good we

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.380 
looks like I nailed it so that's good we
can<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.460> know<00:05:17.550> if<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:17.820> want<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.030> play<00:05:18.240> with

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
can you know if you want to play with

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.630 
can you know if you want to play with
this<00:05:18.540> you<00:05:18.780> can<00:05:18.900> sort<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.260> play<00:05:19.980> with<00:05:20.220> there

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
this you can sort of play with there

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.990 
this you can sort of play with there
being<00:05:20.970> some<00:05:21.420> static<00:05:22.140> cling<00:05:22.500> between<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.760> legs

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
being some static cling between the legs

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.180 
being some static cling between the legs
and<00:05:24.420> then<00:05:25.200> you<00:05:25.410> know<00:05:25.590> they<00:05:25.710> would<00:05:25.890> stick

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
and then you know they would stick

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.310 
and then you know they would stick
together<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:27.380> little<00:05:28.380> bit<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.930> could<00:05:31.080> also

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
together a little bit and you could also

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.900 
together a little bit and you could also
sort<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:32.840> push<00:05:33.840> them<00:05:34.080> apart<00:05:34.820> by<00:05:37.820> having<00:05:38.820> a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
sort of push them apart by having a

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.420 
sort of push them apart by having a
negative<00:05:39.450> value<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.530> now<00:05:40.560> they'll<00:05:40.860> come<00:05:41.130> close

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
negative value so now they'll come close

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.030 
negative value so now they'll come close
to<00:05:41.640> each<00:05:41.700> other<00:05:41.820> but<00:05:42.120> push<00:05:42.390> apart<00:05:42.830> by<00:05:43.830> using

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
to each other but push apart by using

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.110 
to each other but push apart by using
that<00:05:44.280> static<00:05:44.730> cling<00:05:45.300> parameter<00:05:46.100> but<00:05:47.100> we<00:05:47.910> want

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
that static cling parameter but we want

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.180 
that static cling parameter but we want
we'll<00:05:48.360> just<00:05:48.750> sort<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:49.020> set<00:05:49.290> that<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.590> zero<00:05:49.860> for

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
we'll just sort of set that to zero for

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.630 
we'll just sort of set that to zero for
now<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:51.590> really<00:05:52.590> go<00:05:52.740> into<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.100> dynamics

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
now and really go into the dynamics

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.260 
now and really go into the dynamics
properties<00:05:54.210> under<00:05:54.600> like<00:05:54.990> turbulence<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.520> so

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
properties under like turbulence and so

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.910 
properties under like turbulence and so
if<00:05:57.750> we<00:05:58.200> just<00:05:58.350> wanted<00:05:58.620> this<00:05:59.120> to<00:06:00.260> randomly<00:06:01.260> flap

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
if we just wanted this to randomly flap

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.810 
if we just wanted this to randomly flap
its<00:06:02.190> arms<00:06:02.640> around<00:06:03.650> let's<00:06:04.650> find<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.370> under

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
its arms around let's find the under

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.870 
its arms around let's find the under
forces<00:06:06.630> so<00:06:07.440> we<00:06:07.590> could<00:06:07.740> adjust<00:06:07.920> like<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.640> mass

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
forces so we could adjust like the mass

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.190 
forces so we could adjust like the mass
how<00:06:09.180> heavy<00:06:09.450> those<00:06:09.750> are<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.470> other<00:06:11.930> objects<00:06:12.930> and

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
how heavy those are to other objects and

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.260 
how heavy those are to other objects and
also<00:06:13.410> like<00:06:13.980> the<00:06:14.250> intensity<00:06:14.910> of<00:06:15.120> the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
also like the intensity of the

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.610 
also like the intensity of the
turbulence<00:06:16.670> so<00:06:17.670> now<00:06:17.850> we've<00:06:18.090> got<00:06:18.300> this<00:06:18.480> octopus

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
turbulence so now we've got this octopus

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.310 
turbulence so now we've got this octopus
you<00:06:19.980> know<00:06:20.070> whipping<00:06:20.970> its<00:06:21.120> legs<00:06:21.420> around<00:06:21.870> in<00:06:22.230> a

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
you know whipping its legs around in a

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.160 
you know whipping its legs around in a
frenzy<00:06:22.530> right<00:06:26.360> so<00:06:27.360> you<00:06:27.450> don't<00:06:27.600> want<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.780> overdo

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
frenzy right so you don't want to overdo

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.840 
frenzy right so you don't want to overdo
it<00:06:28.200> but<00:06:28.530> it<00:06:29.010> it's<00:06:29.850> starting<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.360> get<00:06:30.480> there

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
it but it it's starting to get there

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.570 
it but it it's starting to get there
awesome

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
awesome

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.600 
awesome
good<00:06:33.819> so<00:06:34.319> the<00:06:35.319> final<00:06:35.979> thing<00:06:36.009> that<00:06:36.370> you<00:06:36.430> might

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
good so the final thing that you might

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.950 
good so the final thing that you might
animate<00:06:37.599> our<00:06:37.750> play<00:06:37.960> with<00:06:38.169> is<00:06:38.699> adjusting<00:06:39.699> the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
animate our play with is adjusting the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.520 
animate our play with is adjusting the
start<00:06:40.960> curve<00:06:41.560> attract<00:06:42.250> parameters<00:06:43.229> well<00:06:44.229> then

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
start curve attract parameters well then

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.649 
start curve attract parameters well then
these<00:06:44.800> are<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:45.099> start<00:06:45.490> curves<00:06:45.819> right<00:06:46.120> here

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
these are the start curves right here

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.700 
these are the start curves right here
and<00:06:47.039> so<00:06:48.039> after<00:06:48.370> creating<00:06:49.060> this<00:06:49.569> all<00:06:49.810> you<00:06:50.560> could

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
and so after creating this all you could

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.170 
and so after creating this all you could
bend<00:06:50.979> these<00:06:51.129> start<00:06:51.550> curves<00:06:51.909> to<00:06:53.370> be<00:06:54.370> look<00:06:55.150> like

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
bend these start curves to be look like

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.869 
bend these start curves to be look like
they're<00:06:55.539> wrapped<00:06:55.900> around<00:06:56.169> some<00:06:56.830> object<00:06:57.669> if

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
they're wrapped around some object if

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.570 
they're wrapped around some object if
you<00:06:57.969> wanted<00:06:58.240> like<00:06:58.780> the<00:06:59.159> octopus<00:07:00.159> to<00:07:00.310> catch<00:07:00.520> a

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
you wanted like the octopus to catch a

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.209 
you wanted like the octopus to catch a
fish<00:07:00.789> or<00:07:01.090> drag<00:07:01.689> a<00:07:01.719> boat<00:07:02.199> into<00:07:02.530> the<00:07:02.560> ocean<00:07:02.680> you

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:03.219 
fish or drag a boat into the ocean you

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:06.089 
fish or drag a boat into the ocean you
could<00:07:04.150> animate<00:07:04.419> this<00:07:04.659> start<00:07:05.080> curve<00:07:05.500> attract

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
could animate this start curve attract

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.580 
could animate this start curve attract
parameter<00:07:06.940> and<00:07:07.150> so<00:07:07.599> right<00:07:07.930> now<00:07:08.080> these<00:07:08.289> start

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
parameter and so right now these start

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.200 
parameter and so right now these start
curves<00:07:08.800> are<00:07:08.979> just<00:07:09.159> sort<00:07:09.310> of<00:07:09.400> still<00:07:09.729> splayed

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
curves are just sort of still splayed

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.170 
curves are just sort of still splayed
out<00:07:11.039> but<00:07:13.259> you<00:07:14.259> know<00:07:14.379> by<00:07:14.979> moving<00:07:15.370> these<00:07:15.729> curves

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
out but you know by moving these curves

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.059 
out but you know by moving these curves
you<00:07:16.389> could<00:07:16.659> sort<00:07:16.870> of<00:07:16.930> get<00:07:17.139> some<00:07:17.169> really<00:07:17.530> he

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069 
you could sort of get some really he

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.570 
you could sort of get some really he
looks<00:07:18.250> like<00:07:18.340> he's<00:07:18.520> doing<00:07:18.819> some<00:07:19.030> dancing<00:07:19.569> but

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
looks like he's doing some dancing but

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.999 
looks like he's doing some dancing but
anyways<00:07:21.580> that's<00:07:22.440> that's<00:07:23.440> a<00:07:23.560> really<00:07:23.800> great

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 
anyways that's that's a really great

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.860 
anyways that's that's a really great
start<00:07:24.370> and<00:07:24.460> I<00:07:24.520> think<00:07:24.729> this<00:07:25.330> is<00:07:25.449> a<00:07:25.479> good<00:07:25.690> place

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
start and I think this is a good place

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.300 
start and I think this is a good place
to<00:07:25.900> end<00:07:26.139> the<00:07:26.199> video<00:07:26.409> thanks<00:07:26.830> so<00:07:26.949> much<00:07:27.009> for

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
to end the video thanks so much for

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.400 
to end the video thanks so much for
