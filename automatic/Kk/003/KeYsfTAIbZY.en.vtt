what I really really like about the
flexi<00:04:51.800> rods<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.279> course<00:04:52.819> if<00:04:52.939> you<00:04:53.089> guys<00:04:53.149> want

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
flexi rods of course if you guys want

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.829 
flexi rods of course if you guys want
more<00:04:54.110> than<00:04:54.349> in<00:04:54.619> arm<00:04:54.919> or<00:04:55.339> more<00:04:56.119> curls<00:04:56.569> in<00:04:56.719> you

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:56.839 
more than in arm or more curls in you

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.649 
more than in arm or more curls in you
here<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.259> can<00:04:57.580> do<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.879> flexi<00:04:59.239> rods<00:04:59.449> in

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
here you can do the flexi rods in

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.989 
here you can do the flexi rods in
smaller<00:05:00.019> section<00:05:00.559> and<00:05:00.769> use<00:05:01.039> more<00:05:01.580> runs<00:05:01.819> in

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:01.999 
smaller section and use more runs in

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:06.579 
smaller section and use more runs in
here<00:05:03.159> but<00:05:04.159> this<00:05:04.369> this<00:05:05.059> simply<00:05:05.899> works<00:05:06.169> for<00:05:06.439> me

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:06.589 
here but this this simply works for me

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.489 
here but this this simply works for me
like<00:05:06.769> that<00:05:06.979> like<00:05:07.849> how<00:05:08.059> it<00:05:08.209> is<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.659> I<00:05:08.689> normally

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:09.499 
like that like how it is so I normally

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.230 
like that like how it is so I normally
don't<00:05:09.679> really<00:05:10.009> put<00:05:10.459> a<00:05:10.639> lot<00:05:10.729> of<00:05:10.879> flexi<00:05:11.330> rods<00:05:11.509> so

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
don't really put a lot of flexi rods so

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.670 
don't really put a lot of flexi rods so
the<00:05:14.240> swapping<00:05:14.569> the<00:05:14.839> curls
