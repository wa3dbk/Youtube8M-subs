00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
had a lot of flower spikes but they were

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:23.820 
had a lot of flower spikes but they were
staked<00:02:23.409> up

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
staked up

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.390 
staked up
doesn't<00:02:24.459> she<00:02:24.580> look<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.569> prettier<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
doesn't she look a lot prettier with the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.869 
doesn't she look a lot prettier with the
flowers<00:02:27.790> pending<00:02:28.390> down<00:02:28.659> somewhat<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:30.190> so

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
flowers pending down somewhat I think so

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.130 
flowers pending down somewhat I think so
I<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.629> not<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.620> those<00:02:33.120> tall<00:02:34.120> Stakes

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140

I do not like those tall Stakes
I<00:02:35.170> hate<00:02:35.500> them<00:02:35.920> she<00:02:36.250> looks<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.579> pretty<00:02:37.090> all

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
I hate them she looks really pretty all

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.460 
I hate them she looks really pretty all
righty<00:02:37.480> let<00:02:37.900> us<00:02:38.049> move<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.840> no<00:02:41.260> ID

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
righty let us move on this is a no ID

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.550 
righty let us move on this is a no ID
but<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.790> really<00:02:43.090> looks<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.780> felon<00:02:44.200> OPS's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
but it really looks like a felon OPS's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.559 
but it really looks like a felon OPS's
orchid<00:02:45.069> world<00:02:45.310> or<00:02:45.609> something<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.239> it

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
orchid world or something like that it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.599 
orchid world or something like that it
is<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.349> particular<00:02:47.560> type<00:02:48.129> of<00:02:48.160> felon

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
is not that particular type of felon

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.940 
is not that particular type of felon
OPS's<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.299> course<00:02:49.569> but<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.650> looks<00:02:50.859> like

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
OPS's of course but it just looks like

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.610 
OPS's of course but it just looks like
it<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.819> like<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.660> orchids<00:02:53.140> simply

because well it's obvious look at these
blooms<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.819> circuit<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.810> fragrant

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
blooms now the circuit is not fragrant

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.390 
blooms now the circuit is not fragrant
unfortunately<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.810> yeah<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.890> pass<00:03:03.129> on

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
so I do intend to keep the circuit my

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.979 
so I do intend to keep the circuit my
major<00:03:08.019> major<00:03:08.799> major<00:03:09.489> regret<00:03:10.299> with<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
major major major regret with the

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.309 
major major major regret with the
circuit<00:03:11.409> is<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.590> she<00:03:12.099> was<00:03:12.370> huge<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.260> don't

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
circuit is that she was huge and I don't

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.430 
circuit is that she was huge and I don't
like<00:03:14.739> huge<00:03:15.099> fouls<00:03:15.489> that's<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.389> thing<00:03:16.599> but

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
like huge fouls that's the thing but

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580 
like huge fouls that's the thing but

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
this shape to the lip that I absolutely

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.839 
this shape to the lip that I absolutely
adore<00:04:05.079> this<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.829> supposed<00:04:06.099> to<00:04:06.190> be<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.370> species

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
adore this is supposed to be a species

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.580 
adore this is supposed to be a species
but<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.150> don't<00:04:07.359> think<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.660> particular<00:04:07.870> one<00:04:08.230> is

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
but I don't think this particular one is

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.210 
but I don't think this particular one is
a<00:04:08.620> true<00:04:09.250> species<00:04:09.579> she<00:04:10.209> was<00:04:10.359> an<00:04:10.480> OID<00:04:11.220> but

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
a true species she was an OID but

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.039 
a true species she was an OID but
definitely<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.639> sort<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.060> cross<00:04:13.419> with<00:04:13.720> us<00:04:13.840> to

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
definitely a sort of a cross with us to

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.449 
definitely a sort of a cross with us to
our<00:04:14.139> Tiana<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:15.209> lastly<00:04:16.320> another<00:04:17.320> no<00:04:17.680> ID<00:04:17.889> a

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
our Tiana and lastly another no ID a

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.260 
our Tiana and lastly another no ID a
pink<00:04:19.120> pink<00:04:20.109> fowl<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:21.099> you<00:04:21.609> know<00:04:21.729> what<00:04:21.909> this<00:04:22.090> is

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
pink pink fowl but you know what this is

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.250 
pink pink fowl but you know what this is
the<00:04:22.390> only<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
the only and

the only and
the<00:04:24.410> only<00:04:24.620> one<00:04:24.770> but<00:04:25.520> one<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.240> few<00:04:26.690> very

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
the only one but one of the few very

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.460 
the only one but one of the few very
complex<00:04:28.010> hybrids<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.850> like<00:04:29.480> simply

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
complex hybrids that I like simply

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.920 
complex hybrids that I like simply
because<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.950> produces<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.730> cascade<00:04:32.510> of

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
because it produces this cascade of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.290 
because it produces this cascade of

than that I only have some species and
another<00:04:50.150> simple<00:04:51.020> hybrid<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.620> that's<00:04:52.340> about

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
look at this and then take a look at

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.450 
look at this and then take a look at
this<00:05:13.520> maxillary<00:05:14.060> ax<00:05:14.240> ah<00:05:14.530> pure<00:05:15.530> perfection<00:05:15.890> but

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
this maxillary ax ah pure perfection but

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.300 
this maxillary ax ah pure perfection but
this<00:05:17.230> alright<00:05:18.230> you<00:05:18.380> know<00:05:18.500> I'm<00:05:18.740> just<00:05:18.920> strange

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
this alright you know I'm just strange

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.950 
this alright you know I'm just strange
but<00:05:19.580> that's<00:05:19.790> what<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.120> actually<00:05:20.420> don't<00:05:20.810> like

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
but that's what I actually don't like

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.900 
but that's what I actually don't like
about<00:05:21.410> felon<00:05:21.770> OPS's<00:05:22.100> they<00:05:22.220> can<00:05:22.370> get<00:05:22.520> really

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
about felon OPS's they can get really

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.080 
about felon OPS's they can get really
large<00:05:23.090> they<00:05:23.510> can<00:05:23.540> drip<00:05:24.500> down<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.830> lot<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.610> I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
large they can drip down a lot and I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.610 
large they can drip down a lot and I
don't<00:05:26.390> know<00:05:26.600> if<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.810> don't<00:05:26.990> keep<00:05:27.140> them<00:05:27.350> hang

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
don't know if you don't keep them hang

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.940 
don't know if you don't keep them hang
so<00:05:27.860> they<00:05:27.980> can<00:05:28.160> become<00:05:28.310> quite<00:05:29.260> boring<00:05:30.260> in<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.800> way

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
so they can become quite boring in a way

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.700 
so they can become quite boring in a way
I<00:05:31.280> don't<00:05:31.760> know<00:05:32.300> it's<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:33.140> my<00:05:33.260> issue<00:05:33.470> with

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
I don't know it's just my issue with

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.800 
I don't know it's just my issue with
them<00:05:33.890> but<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.400> really<00:05:34.550> doesn't<00:05:34.880> mean<00:05:35.210> that<00:05:35.540> I

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
them but it really doesn't mean that I

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.660 
them but it really doesn't mean that I
will<00:05:35.870> not<00:05:36.200> keep<00:05:36.440> some<00:05:36.710> felon<00:05:36.980> OPS's<00:05:37.280> or<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.640> I
