out of position off the courts plus it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
out of position off the courts plus it's
to<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> writings<00:00:58.350> backhand<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to a writings backhand so that's just a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.319 
to a writings backhand so that's just a
really<00:00:59.850> tough<00:00:59.969> thing<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.600> handle<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.230> well

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
really tough thing to handle right well

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.190 
really tough thing to handle right well
most<00:01:03.329> lefties<00:01:03.930> aren't<00:01:04.519> extremely<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.790> at

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
most lefties aren't extremely good at

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
most lefties aren't extremely good at
hitting<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.680> tee<00:01:08.369> serve<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> lot

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
hitting this tee serve and I think a lot

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.710 
hitting this tee serve and I think a lot
of<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.520> tennis<00:01:12.150> players<00:01:12.330> kind<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of times we as tennis players kind of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
of times we as tennis players kind of
assume<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:14.130> serve

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
assume that if they have a good serve

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 
assume that if they have a good serve
they<00:01:15.090> must<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.869> hitting<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
they must be good at hitting all

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
they must be good at hitting all
different<00:01:16.710> parts<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> box<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:18.119> all

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
different parts of the box and with all

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.820 
different parts of the box and with all
different<00:01:18.509> types<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.049> serves<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.590> they

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
different types of serves you know they

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460 
different types of serves you know they
just<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> good<00:01:20.670> serve<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
just have a good serve and so we have to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.260 
just have a good serve and so we have to
kind<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> treat<00:01:22.979> everything<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.880> equal

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
kind of treat everything with equal

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
kind of treat everything with equal
respect<00:01:24.689> well<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> lot<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> times<00:01:26.070> left-handed

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
respect well a lot of times left-handed

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.960 
respect well a lot of times left-handed
players<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.320> used<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> abusing<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> out

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
players are so used to abusing that out

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
players are so used to abusing that out
wide<00:01:30.210> serve<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.439> rarely<00:01:31.799> work<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
wide serve that they rarely work on that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
wide serve that they rarely work on that
down<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> tee<00:01:33.299> serve<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> would

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
down the tee serve so what I would

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.690 
down the tee serve so what I would
suggest<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:36.020> rather<00:01:37.020> than<00:01:37.700> standing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
suggest to you is rather than standing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.179 
suggest to you is rather than standing
where<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> typically<00:01:39.540> would<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.860> return

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
where you typically would to return

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
where you typically would to return
serve<00:01:41.549> which<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:42.840> less

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
serve which is you know more or less

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
serve which is you know more or less
kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> halfway<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.740> between<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.060> tee

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
kind of halfway in between the the tee

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
kind of halfway in between the the tee
serve<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.189> standard<00:01:47.189> wide<00:01:47.460> serve<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
serve and a standard wide serve what I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840 
serve and a standard wide serve what I
would<00:01:48.659> suggest<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> John<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.399> making
