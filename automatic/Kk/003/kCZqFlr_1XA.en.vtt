00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.779
 voting at their order proposes not very well know another 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.169
 when we make the wire accumulate on the 39 hours of the earth a test in 2d 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.169
 and another in 3d ap 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.550
 so one of the major assets of this loss is windows aero this is the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.720
 possibility that we now have to solve a very old problem 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 very recurrent counting work on a computer 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.450
 indeed when we are brought notes lover worked with several applications 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.050
 at the same time on the screen of his computer and p1 will accumulate a 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 sometimes astronomical amount of windows 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.680
 and that the consequence is that the blow from one window to another for the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.810
 consult for him to retrieve information 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.750
 to quite tricky for that windows 7 alejo will offer us some 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.820
 totally new solutions 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.230
 economic resale 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.980
 and he's going to make it our job 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 much more efficient it is fast 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.189
 while I will voluntarily open 3 4 to be born 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.639
 on the screen of my computer I issued 6 on the desktop of my windows 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.240
 vista some links to files 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.820
 I will now open 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.730
 so day opens 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.840
 this little image make it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.130
 double click 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.470
 I have a friend mage this tree that appears 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 and then I will click on this presentation plan 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.330
 then the icis on a document 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.799
 those who live to present me a table is simply 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.479
 just completing that leads to creating relief simply 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.720
 and finally here I will click on a link that will allow me to open the page 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.510
 official 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.850
 microsoft about operating systems 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.870
 for a dose of vista 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.479
 so on the big screen 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.549
 here I see it I'm watching 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.759
 several windows the gemini above each other and if for example I would like 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 meet again 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 in its entirety not the microsoft website about 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.240
 windows 6 tamer 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.110
 my painting 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.130
 xl which is just below 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.740
 and many solutions are at my disposal the first one that we 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.340
 already knew a safe 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.860
 Lepine dose previously 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.630
 was to click on this little button that will just reduce my 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.539
 window 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:17.769
 right here 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.520
 the taskbar so that it was the first solution 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.730
 I can also transplant into the status bar I'm back on my 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.349
 windows vista home page 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.249
 she returns 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.980
 it's a first solution 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.760
 and if not the other solution he put the guys mans 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.899
 possible it was simply 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.969
 move my windows here with my title bar i click on the button 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.339
 left mouse 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.589
 I move to be and to kill the mans cgt on the end but who is 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.820
 just below 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.690
 for this one 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.270
 low in the foreground so here are the solutions we did not know the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.689
 happened if I can say 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.560
 now with windows aero interface us before we could restore older 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.519
 which will allow us 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.659
 to switch from one window to another very 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.629
 very easily 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.260
 I would like to find here 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.909
 the image of my tree that I opened just now of course I could 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.170
 move my items 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.359
 but I see immediately that it will be complicated 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.629
 so I'm going to use the ap shortcut 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.549
 and touch two tables on my keyboard 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.569
 it's right above the caps lock 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.709
 and then I tried 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.180
 window that appears 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.659
 equivalent allow by successive impulses always on the 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.009
 tab key while holding the 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.389
 stop to support 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.599
 from 10 to a computer 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.489
 which window I will want to be able to come to the fore 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.409
 and then I'm going to be placed 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.370
 my selection window in suede tree and photo material or a 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.949
 dose 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.439
 and letting go while the touch 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.180
 my window presenting me here my image returns to the foreground 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.629
 in the moment simply 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.540
 and I can watch it eventually make changes if I 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.019
 wanted on this type of file 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:55.780
 print 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.559
 for example here with the knife impressions 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.879
 so without this is our first shortcut that allows us to see toggle very 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.259
 it's a bit lack of a window to another 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.629
 the problem of this first sylvie tells if I can say is that for 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.920
 we 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.140
 we also know I redo it with the key stop the tab key 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.290
 here we have an overview 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.669
 very eclectic and that always allows us not always to be sure 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.299
 that if we breed him 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.969
 the window so we wanted at all costs 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.389
 the second keyboard shortcuts that will introduce the effects of 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:26.990
 3d 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.980
 in the interface of windows aero not be us from this point of view a lot 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.050
 more useful and effective 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.889
 I will press his touch a dose of my keyboard mutas neiman 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.840
 always on that same tab key 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.039
 the different windows that are open 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.979
 on my computer screen 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.150
 and let's see scrolling with impulses always 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.360
 successively on the tab key 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.479
 always now 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.509
 the windows 7 key pressed 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.150
 it allows me to scroll 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.210
 by this beautiful fan effect but different windows 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.160
 and when those who matt rsf are not in the foreground 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.460
 I could not hide the windows 7 key 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.250
 and this one 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.050
 come back 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.150
 now in the foreground and I'm sure it's this one that I wanted 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.690
 and I can again as before, either in print or 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.509
 make corrections 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.560
 or more simply here used 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.490
 my zoom tool for 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.430
 so these two shortcuts 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.120
 tabulation 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.030
 the windows shortcut is the tab key need to put it very convenient 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.380
 to go from one window to another and everyday my ease my work 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.710
 to finish besides on this shortcut 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.700
 and the tab key if you run maintenance shortcuts by 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.800
 successive impulses on the tab key it's still going in the same 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.870
 meaning 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.479
 but you can also use the keys 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.900
 and especially the keyboard arrows that are in this format of tayninh paid 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.470
 on a computer keyboard for possibly 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.630
 go in either direction from left to right or from right to 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.990
 left 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.699
 so to allow 6 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.339
 a selection of more affluent windows 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.500
 then 6 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.940
 these gossip site life you escape here wanted to forget afterwards what 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.610
 is not the morning because in reality you will be able with the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.499
 button that is 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:12.810
 in the taskbar 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.210
 so we can just feel like iron of course 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.900
 the wires and all the windows open on the screen of his computer 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.129
 with the shortcuts we've seen 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.520
 but sometimes we will need 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.050
 2 come back on the desk for example I have here 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.669
 small files 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.430
 a video file that I would like to put in the trash gold I know that 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.300
 the trash can icon is located 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.039
 a little lower right on the screen 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.129
 from my computer and on the desk 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.629
 well I would have to temporarily register all the windows that 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.119
 are here in power execute this operation 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.400
 I will click here if he will have posted the office 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.360
 and that windows 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.919
 momentarily disappear 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.320
 and you see that I will be able to take my video file and the master 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.469
 in the trash 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.639
 so this is this first buttons in the taskbar that pays way to 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.439
 hide 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.479
 or to display all the windows it is 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.249
 to display the screen of my computer 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:08.249
 if I would have clicked on the entirety of this honest 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.659
 and 15th knife that also allows me to big egg air this fan a 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.320
 carrying on my pc 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.740
 well c the button switch between windows here 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.650
 find you this nice fan activated accounts 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.229
 just now with the shortcut 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:23.909
 windows 7 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.650
 he has just homes and now I can again with the 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:28.229
 arrows 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.169
 from Montpellier 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.419
 go both ways why choose them the window I want to see 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.219
 compromised arrivals and plan 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:37.499
 and then press the key enter my keyboard 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.430
 for this one 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.369
 appear 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:42.839
 so that's the totally new fundamental shortcut and that have been 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.940
 introduced so 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.600
 with the windows aero interface and that will allow you more 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.380
 embarrassed by having dozens see hundreds of windows 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.650
 open at the same time he also knows on the same post the screen of your 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.880
 computer
