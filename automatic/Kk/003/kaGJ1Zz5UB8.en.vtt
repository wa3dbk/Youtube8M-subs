so what we have to do now is we've got

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
so what we have to do now is we've got
an<00:00:41.460> assemble<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:44.699> boards<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.449> get<00:00:45.840> them<00:00:45.989> set

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
an assemble the boards and get them set

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.520 
an assemble the boards and get them set
up<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:48.000> hang<00:00:48.239> them<00:00:48.449> from<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
up so that we can hang them from the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.849 
up so that we can hang them from the
inside<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.320> let<00:00:52.320> me<00:00:52.410> show<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.589> what<00:00:52.800> it

inside like this let me show you what it

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:22.920 
inside like this let me show you what it
looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.100> inside

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.510 

see<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.080> is<00:01:24.260> where<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.799> bees<00:01:24.979> will<00:01:25.010> build

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
see this is where the bees will build

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.130 
see this is where the bees will build
the<00:01:26.390> honeycomb<00:01:28.030> it's<00:01:29.030> coated<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.570> beeswax

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the honeycomb it's coated with beeswax

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.280 
the honeycomb it's coated with beeswax
already<00:01:31.210> they<00:01:32.210> must<00:01:32.450> spray<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.900> on<00:01:33.020> or<00:01:33.260> they

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
already they must spray it on or they

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.649 
already they must spray it on or they
must<00:01:33.619> yeah<00:01:34.430> they<00:01:34.580> must<00:01:34.760> we<00:01:34.970> just<00:01:35.150> spray<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.420> on

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
must yeah they must we just spray it on

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.920 
must yeah they must we just spray it on
and<00:01:38.110> then<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.380> hang<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.950> from<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.899> top

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
and then you just hang this from the top

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.149 
and then you just hang this from the top
of<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.290> hive<00:01:44.440> just<00:01:45.440> put<00:01:45.649> like<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.830> little

and really get you excited about
beekeeping<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.630> major

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
beekeeping because I think it's a major

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.190 
beekeeping because I think it's a major
major<00:02:21.790> component<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:23.239> we're<00:02:23.660> doing<00:02:24.080> in

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
major component to what we're doing in

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.650 
major component to what we're doing in
this<00:02:24.290> overall<00:02:24.650> project<00:02:24.980> we're<00:02:25.880> providing

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
this overall project we're providing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.500 
this overall project we're providing
pollination<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.980> know<00:02:28.130> where<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.940> know<00:02:29.060> bees

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
pollination you know where you know bees

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.060 
pollination you know where you know bees
are<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.290> important<00:02:30.739> part<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
are a really important part of the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.890 
are a really important part of the
ecosystem<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:31.910> really<00:02:32.299> depend<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.750> them

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
ecosystem and we really depend on them

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.020 
ecosystem and we really depend on them
more<00:02:33.079> than<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.769> if<00:02:34.549> every<00:02:35.000> family

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
more than we know and if every family

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.870 
more than we know and if every family
can<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.840> their<00:02:36.079> own<00:02:36.110> personal<00:02:36.709> beehive<00:02:37.160> it's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
can have their own personal beehive it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.210 
can have their own personal beehive it's
I<00:02:38.360> think<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.049> be<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.799> cool

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I think it's going to be so cool

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.979 
I think it's going to be so cool
especially<00:02:40.579> with<00:02:40.940> everybody's<00:02:41.420> fruit<00:02:41.690> trees

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
especially with everybody's fruit trees

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.830 
especially with everybody's fruit trees
I<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:43.160> hope<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.670> maybe<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.329> 10<00:02:44.570> years

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
I really hope that maybe in 10 years

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.590 
I really hope that maybe in 10 years
this<00:02:45.140> will<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> common<00:02:45.860> sight<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:47.209> really

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
this will be a common sight it's really

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.970 
this will be a common sight it's really
about<00:02:47.690> beehives<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.440> doesn't<00:02:48.680> cost<00:02:48.799> that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
about beehives and it doesn't cost that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190 
about beehives and it doesn't cost that
much<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.250> get<00:02:49.519> started<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.570> can<00:02:50.720> watch<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:51.019> few

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
much to get started you can watch a few

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920 
much to get started you can watch a few
videos<00:02:51.440> get<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.100> book<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.790> you'll<00:02:53.630> be<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:53.810> your

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
videos get a book and you'll be on your

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.569 
videos get a book and you'll be on your
way<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.530> doesn't<00:02:54.920> take<00:02:55.040> don't<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.430> intimidated

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
way it doesn't take don't be intimidated

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.449 
way it doesn't take don't be intimidated
by<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.269> because<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.650> bees<00:02:57.829> really<00:02:58.070> know<00:02:58.310> what

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
by it because the bees really know what

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.680 
by it because the bees really know what
they're<00:02:58.549> doing<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.910> just<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.329> to<00:02:59.420> provide

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
they're doing you just have to provide

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.210 
they're doing you just have to provide
the<00:02:59.959> right<00:03:00.110> environment<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.739> them<00:03:01.010> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the right environment for them and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
the right environment for them and
they'll<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.450> what<00:03:02.570> they've<00:03:02.780> been<00:03:03.049> you

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
they'll just do what they've been you

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.210 
they'll just do what they've been you
know<00:03:03.620> created<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:05.829> not<00:03:06.829> like<00:03:06.980> I'm<00:03:07.130> you

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
know created to do not like I'm you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.110 
know created to do not like I'm you
created<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:09.519> all<00:03:10.519> right<00:03:10.670> now<00:03:10.820> we're<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
created it all right now we're going to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.599 
created it all right now we're going to
assemble<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.840> brute<00:03:12.230> frame<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.220> what<00:03:13.400> goal

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
assemble a brute frame this is what goal

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.810 
assemble a brute frame this is what goal
was<00:03:13.790> inside<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.420> hive<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:16.130> one<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.430> made

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
was inside the hive this one I just made

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.319 
was inside the hive this one I just made
and<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.500> lays<00:03:18.820> right<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> two

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
and it just lays right in the two

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.140 
and it just lays right in the two
grooves<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.260> front<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.579> back<00:03:22.609> here

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
grooves on the front and the back here

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.500 
grooves on the front and the back here
and<00:03:23.329> then<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:24.290> bill<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:25.190> bees<00:03:25.910> will<00:03:25.940> build

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and then the bill the bees will build

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.440 
and then the bill the bees will build
their<00:03:26.750> pattern<00:03:27.700> right<00:03:28.700> along<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.239> this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
their pattern right along here and this

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.440 
their pattern right along here and this
is<00:03:29.510> where<00:03:29.660> they<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:29.930> their<00:03:30.260> larvae<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
is where they put their larvae and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.080 
is where they put their larvae and
and<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> pollen<00:03:35.129> so<00:03:36.129> you<00:03:36.190> put<00:03:36.610> on<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.819> thin

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
and the pollen so you put on the thin

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.780 
and the pollen so you put on the thin
part<00:03:37.120> first<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.769> what<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.220> don't<00:03:39.610> know<00:03:39.730> if

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
part first this is what I don't know if

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.070 
part first this is what I don't know if
there's<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.269> or<00:03:40.390> wrong<00:03:40.420> way<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.720> do<00:03:40.930> this

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
there's a right or wrong way to do this

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.470 
there's a right or wrong way to do this
but<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:42.280> pretty<00:03:42.910> simple<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.360> just

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
but this is it's pretty simple you just

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.270 
but this is it's pretty simple you just
have<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.900> build<00:03:44.170> there's<00:03:44.470> grooves<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:45.099> one

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
have to build there's grooves on one

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.960 
have to build there's grooves on one
side<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.300> comb<00:03:46.540> will<00:03:46.810> fit<00:03:47.170> into<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
side and the comb will fit into it and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.839 
side and the comb will fit into it and
then<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.480> put<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.780> sides<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.849> then

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
then you just put the sides on and then

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.360 
then you just put the sides on and then
the<00:03:55.330> bottom<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.349> top<00:03:56.560> piece<00:03:56.830> is<00:03:57.099> thicker

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
the bottom of the top piece is thicker

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.530 
the bottom of the top piece is thicker
and<00:03:58.799> then<00:03:59.799> it<00:04:00.010> also<00:04:00.190> has<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.519> groove<00:04:00.879> on<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
and then it also has a groove on the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.390 
and then it also has a groove on the
bottom<00:04:01.870> side<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:05.290> kind<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.620> work<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.130> groove

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
bottom side just kind of work the groove

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.920 
bottom side just kind of work the groove
in<00:04:08.430> because<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.549> don't<00:04:09.700> think<00:04:09.880> any<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.810> don't

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
in because I don't think any I don't

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.860 
in because I don't think any I don't
know<00:04:11.079> any<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:11.590> company<00:04:12.040> actually<00:04:12.599> does<00:04:13.599> this

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
know any be company actually does this

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.099 
know any be company actually does this
for<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.319> if<00:04:14.530> they<00:04:14.769> ship<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.220> assemble<00:04:15.790> combs

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
for you if they ship you assemble combs

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.920 
for you if they ship you assemble combs
usually<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.229> have<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.410> put<00:04:17.680> them<00:04:17.799> together

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
usually you have to put them together

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:28.020 
usually you have to put them together
but<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.049> could<00:04:20.169> be<00:04:20.290> wrong<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:27.130> work<00:04:27.310> work<00:04:27.850> it

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
but it could be wrong just work work it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.370 
but it could be wrong just work work it
into<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.300> groove<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:30.400> there's<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.780> then

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
into the groove so there's this and then

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.210 
into the groove so there's this and then
we<00:04:32.500> add<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.430> last<00:04:33.669> side<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:35.830> side<00:04:35.860> is

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
we add on the last side one side is

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.639 
we add on the last side one side is
better<00:04:36.430> than<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:37.539> other<00:04:38.400> fit<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.610> there<00:04:41.700> fit

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:45.649 

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.189 

this<00:04:46.649> is<00:04:46.769> it<00:04:47.299> it<00:04:48.299> just<00:04:48.479> fits<00:04:48.659> on<00:04:48.779> the<00:04:48.899> inside

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
this is it it just fits on the inside

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.199 
this is it it just fits on the inside
but<00:04:49.739> then<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:49.979> have<00:04:50.099> to<00:04:50.929> make<00:04:51.929> some<00:04:53.209> you

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:54.209 
but then you have to make some you

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:58.100 
but then you have to make some you
probably<00:04:54.389> have<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.629> put<00:04:54.899> glue<00:04:55.709> it<00:04:55.860> together<00:04:57.110> or

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
probably have to put glue it together or

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.929 
probably have to put glue it together or
nail<00:04:58.439> it<00:04:58.619> I'm<00:04:58.799> not<00:04:58.949> sure<00:04:59.039> how<00:04:59.279> that<00:04:59.429> works<00:04:59.610> but

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
nail it I'm not sure how that works but

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.709 
nail it I'm not sure how that works but
it<00:05:00.779> seems<00:05:01.110> like<00:05:01.439> once<00:05:01.829> its<00:05:02.449> there's<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.539> lot<00:05:03.569> of

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
it seems like once its there's a lot of

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.659 
it seems like once its there's a lot of
weight<00:05:03.959> on<00:05:03.989> it<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.439> could<00:05:04.589> almost<00:05:04.709> fall<00:05:05.429> out<00:05:05.549> of

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
weight on it it could almost fall out of

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.619 
weight on it it could almost fall out of
these<00:05:05.819> groups<00:05:08.119> but<00:05:09.119> that<00:05:09.269> didn't<00:05:09.479> take<00:05:09.599> too

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
these groups but that didn't take too

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.209 
these groups but that didn't take too
long<00:05:09.899> it's<00:05:10.349> pretty<00:05:10.559> easy<00:05:10.709> and<00:05:10.919> it's<00:05:11.039> kind<00:05:11.189> of

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
long it's pretty easy and it's kind of

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.739 
long it's pretty easy and it's kind of
fun<00:05:11.399> to<00:05:11.429> do<00:05:11.579> with<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.729> friend<00:05:12.059> you<00:05:12.569> know<00:05:12.599> you

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
fun to do with a friend you know you

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.449 
fun to do with a friend you know you
just<00:05:12.869> talk<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.379> hang<00:05:13.559> out<00:05:13.709> and<00:05:13.949> just<00:05:14.009> put

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:14.459 
just talk and hang out and just put

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:16.219 
just talk and hang out and just put
these<00:05:14.579> together<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.089> bring<00:05:15.839> something<00:05:16.110> up<00:05:16.169> a

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
these together and bring something up a

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.989 
these together and bring something up a
big<00:05:16.409> pile<00:05:16.619> of<00:05:16.829> them<00:05:17.009> because<00:05:17.159> each<00:05:17.279> one<00:05:17.489> has<00:05:17.699> 10

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:17.999 
big pile of them because each one has 10

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.379 
big pile of them because each one has 10
so<00:05:18.779> if<00:05:18.899> you're<00:05:19.019> going<00:05:19.139> to<00:05:19.199> have<00:05:19.409> like<00:05:20.389> two

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
so if you're going to have like two

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.259 
so if you're going to have like two
hives<00:05:21.719> or<00:05:22.139> even<00:05:22.649> just<00:05:22.679> 11<00:05:23.519> high<00:05:23.729> which<00:05:24.089> is

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:24.269 
hives or even just 11 high which is

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.299 
hives or even just 11 high which is
perfect<00:05:24.749> for<00:05:24.779> a<00:05:24.899> family<00:05:25.079> and<00:05:25.469> have<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.099> like

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 
perfect for a family and have it like

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.989 
perfect for a family and have it like
five<00:05:27.209> stories<00:05:27.629> tall<00:05:27.659> that's<00:05:28.559> 50<00:05:29.309> 50<00:05:29.849> of<00:05:29.909> these

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:29.999 
five stories tall that's 50 50 of these

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.299 
five stories tall that's 50 50 of these
yet<00:05:30.269> to<00:05:30.389> do<00:05:30.509> so<00:05:30.779> maybe<00:05:31.739> it<00:05:31.889> probably<00:05:32.159> takes

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:32.309 
yet to do so maybe it probably takes

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:34.459 
yet to do so maybe it probably takes
about<00:05:32.399> two<00:05:32.729> minutes<00:05:32.759> for<00:05:33.239> each<00:05:33.269> one<00:05:33.569> not<00:05:34.439> even

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
about two minutes for each one not even

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.409 
about two minutes for each one not even
probably<00:05:35.159> like<00:05:35.309> a<00:05:35.339> minute<00:05:35.759> once<00:05:35.969> you<00:05:36.089> get<00:05:36.209> good

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
probably like a minute once you get good

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.029 
probably like a minute once you get good
at<00:05:36.569> it<00:05:36.599> that<00:05:37.049> probably<00:05:37.259> for<00:05:37.679> me<00:05:37.769> to<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:37.979> a

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
at it that probably for me to it a

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.319 
at it that probably for me to it a
little<00:05:38.159> bit<00:05:38.339> longer<00:05:38.459> than<00:05:38.699> usual<00:05:38.789> because<00:05:39.149> I

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:39.329 
little bit longer than usual because I

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:40.729 
little bit longer than usual because I
got<00:05:39.629> a<00:05:39.659> little<00:05:39.779> nervous<00:05:39.929> gazelles<00:05:40.499> on<00:05:40.649> the

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:40.739 
got a little nervous gazelles on the

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:42.559 
got a little nervous gazelles on the
camera<00:05:41.069> but<00:05:41.309> otherwise<00:05:41.909> you<00:05:42.209> can<00:05:42.360> put<00:05:42.479> them

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
camera but otherwise you can put them

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.929 
camera but otherwise you can put them
together<00:05:42.659> pretty<00:05:42.929> quick<00:05:43.279> yeah<00:05:44.279> and<00:05:44.610> then<00:05:44.819> you

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
together pretty quick yeah and then you

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.299 
together pretty quick yeah and then you
just<00:05:45.209> get<00:05:45.389> your<00:05:45.479> box<00:05:45.719> and<00:05:46.129> have<00:05:47.129> whatever

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:47.309 
just get your box and have whatever

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:48.829 
just get your box and have whatever
would<00:05:47.669> you<00:05:47.789> want<00:05:47.999> it<00:05:48.149> it<00:05:48.360> would<00:05:48.509> be<00:05:48.629> really

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
would you want it it would be really

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.569 
would you want it it would be really
cool<00:05:49.110> more<00:05:49.860> people<00:05:50.009> need<00:05:50.159> to<00:05:50.339> get<00:05:50.459> into

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:50.579 
cool more people need to get into

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:52.850 
cool more people need to get into
beekeeping<00:05:50.999> as<00:05:51.269> soon<00:05:51.419> as<00:05:51.509> possible<00:05:51.989> even<00:05:52.589> if<00:05:52.679> I

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
beekeeping as soon as possible even if I

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.329 
beekeeping as soon as possible even if I
had<00:05:53.159> a<00:05:53.489> an<00:05:53.699> apartment<00:05:54.569> in<00:05:54.869> New<00:05:55.379> York<00:05:55.439> I<00:05:55.829> think<00:05:56.159> I

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
had a an apartment in New York I think I

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.600 
had a an apartment in New York I think I
would<00:05:56.550> you<00:05:57.029> could<00:05:57.149> just<00:05:58.309> assemble<00:05:59.309> the<00:05:59.399> hive

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
would you could just assemble the hive

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.479 
would you could just assemble the hive
so<00:06:00.509> it's<00:06:00.719> right<00:06:01.169> on<00:06:01.199> one<00:06:01.589> window<00:06:01.949> and<00:06:02.189> then<00:06:02.369> the

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:02.489 
so it's right on one window and then the

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:04.339 
so it's right on one window and then the
bees<00:06:02.669> just<00:06:02.939> fly<00:06:03.149> out<00:06:03.179> one<00:06:03.539> little<00:06:03.839> hole<00:06:04.019> right

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
bees just fly out one little hole right

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.559 
bees just fly out one little hole right
off<00:06:05.189> of<00:06:05.219> the<00:06:05.579> fire<00:06:05.849> escape<00:06:06.029> and<00:06:06.509> then

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
off of the fire escape and then

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.809 
off of the fire escape and then
intellect<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:07.409> parks<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.099> they<00:06:08.550> come<00:06:08.789> back

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
intellect the parks and they come back

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.549 
intellect the parks and they come back
and<00:06:09.269> whenever<00:06:09.719> you<00:06:09.959> would<00:06:10.079> want<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.349> harvest

00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:10.559 
and whenever you would want to harvest

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.469 
and whenever you would want to harvest
you<00:06:10.829> could<00:06:10.979> like<00:06:11.129> slide<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.819> back<00:06:11.969> and<00:06:12.269> lift

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
you could like slide it back and lift

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.989 
you could like slide it back and lift
the<00:06:12.599> things<00:06:12.839> up<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.439> take<00:06:14.339> all<00:06:14.489> the<00:06:14.610> money<00:06:14.729> you

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:14.999 
the things up and take all the money you

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.549 
the things up and take all the money you
know<00:06:15.089> scrape<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.569> cabins<00:06:15.929> off<00:06:16.079> and<00:06:16.289> take<00:06:16.439> the

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:16.559 
know scrape the cabins off and take the

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:20.059 
know scrape the cabins off and take the
honey<00:06:17.509> anybody<00:06:18.509> could<00:06:19.139> do<00:06:19.289> this<00:06:19.499> it's<00:06:19.829> not<00:06:20.009> a

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
honey anybody could do this it's not a

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.579 
honey anybody could do this it's not a
big<00:06:20.459> deal<00:06:20.489> it's<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.659> lot<00:06:21.869> easier<00:06:21.899> than<00:06:22.259> what<00:06:22.499> I

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
big deal it's a lot easier than what I

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.469 
big deal it's a lot easier than what I
thought<00:06:22.619> it<00:06:22.799> would<00:06:22.979> be<00:06:23.159> of<00:06:23.339> course<00:06:23.999> like<00:06:24.329> maybe

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
thought it would be of course like maybe

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.850 
thought it would be of course like maybe
maintaining<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.229> high<00:06:25.349> and<00:06:25.529> keeping<00:06:25.649> them

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
maintaining the high and keeping them

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.009 
maintaining the high and keeping them
alive<00:06:26.009> but<00:06:26.879> as<00:06:26.969> far<00:06:27.119> as<00:06:27.179> like<00:06:27.419> setup<00:06:27.809> is

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.019 
alive but as far as like setup is

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:30.079 
alive but as far as like setup is
concerned<00:06:28.799> it's<00:06:29.339> pretty<00:06:29.610> easy<00:06:29.759> to<00:06:29.999> get

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
concerned it's pretty easy to get

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.879 
concerned it's pretty easy to get
started<00:06:30.389> and<00:06:30.749> you<00:06:31.079> can<00:06:31.229> at<00:06:31.469> least<00:06:31.499> learn<00:06:31.860> the

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
started and you can at least learn the

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.279 
started and you can at least learn the
basics<00:06:32.459> pretty<00:06:32.729> easily<00:06:35.029> because<00:06:36.029> it's<00:06:36.449> we've

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
basics pretty easily because it's we've

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.749 
basics pretty easily because it's we've
got<00:06:37.499> to<00:06:37.619> start<00:06:37.799> doing<00:06:37.860> more<00:06:38.129> beehives<00:06:38.519> and

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
got to start doing more beehives and

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.489 
got to start doing more beehives and
there's<00:06:39.329> going<00:06:39.449> to<00:06:39.539> be<00:06:39.569> lots<00:06:39.899> more<00:06:40.169> beef

we're doing in this overall project
we're<00:07:09.280> providing<00:07:10.060> pollination<00:07:10.660> you<00:07:11.380> know

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
we're providing pollination you know

we're providing pollination you know
where<00:07:11.650> you<00:07:12.340> know<00:07:12.460> bees<00:07:12.910> are<00:07:13.180> a<00:07:13.210> really

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
where you know bees are a really

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.300 
where you know bees are a really
important<00:07:14.139> part<00:07:14.260> of<00:07:14.410> the<00:07:14.470> ecosystem<00:07:14.710> and<00:07:15.250> we

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
important part of the ecosystem and we

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.860 
important part of the ecosystem and we
really<00:07:15.699> depend<00:07:15.850> on<00:07:16.150> them<00:07:16.300> more<00:07:16.479> than<00:07:16.600> we<00:07:16.720> know

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.500 
really depend on them more than we know
and<00:07:17.169> if<00:07:17.949> every<00:07:18.400> family<00:07:18.430> can<00:07:19.030> have<00:07:19.060> their<00:07:19.479> own

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
and if every family can have their own

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.350 
and if every family can have their own
personal<00:07:20.139> beehive<00:07:20.560> it's<00:07:21.160> I<00:07:21.760> think<00:07:21.910> it's<00:07:22.150> going

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
personal beehive it's I think it's going

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.300 
personal beehive it's I think it's going
to<00:07:22.479> be<00:07:22.630> so<00:07:23.200> cool<00:07:23.590> especially<00:07:24.220> with

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
to be so cool especially with

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.760 
to be so cool especially with
everybody's<00:07:24.820> fruit<00:07:25.090> trees<00:07:25.389> I<00:07:25.690> really<00:07:26.560> hope

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 
everybody's fruit trees I really hope

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.830 
everybody's fruit trees I really hope
that<00:07:27.070> maybe<00:07:27.520> in<00:07:27.729> 10<00:07:27.970> years<00:07:28.210> this<00:07:28.540> will<00:07:28.690> be<00:07:28.810> a

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
that maybe in 10 years this will be a

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.560 
that maybe in 10 years this will be a
common<00:07:29.260> sight<00:07:29.610> it's<00:07:30.610> really<00:07:31.000> about<00:07:31.090> beehives

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.570 
common sight it's really about beehives

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.940 
common sight it's really about beehives
and<00:07:31.690> it<00:07:31.810> doesn't<00:07:32.080> cost<00:07:32.200> that<00:07:32.380> much<00:07:32.470> to<00:07:32.650> get

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
and it doesn't cost that much to get

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.490 
and it doesn't cost that much to get
started<00:07:33.280> you<00:07:33.970> can<00:07:34.120> watch<00:07:34.270> a<00:07:34.419> few<00:07:34.600> videos<00:07:34.840> get<00:07:35.440> a

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.500 
started you can watch a few videos get a

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.920 
started you can watch a few videos get a
book<00:07:35.860> and<00:07:36.160> you'll<00:07:37.030> be<00:07:37.180> on<00:07:37.210> your<00:07:37.330> way<00:07:37.510> it
