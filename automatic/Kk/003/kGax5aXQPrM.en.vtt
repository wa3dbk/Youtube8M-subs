 images of the second day of racing and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 that during the first day we suffer the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.520
 inconvenience of the theft of one of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 our cameras in a hotel in alberdi 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 there they subtracted us 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.259
 the camera and all the material that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.329
 we had collected during the first 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.270
 competition day whereby 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.740
 we apologize we will share

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.630
 the competition especially some 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.750
 Cordovan but nevertheless almost 90 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.670
 machines an important number for the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 Argentine championship met here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.319
 although it does not seem to be a number that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.030
 could impress anyone but for a 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.160
 Argentine championship where you have to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.819
 have two days of very successful careers 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.700
 demanding by the way and that apart 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.950
 they require to distract work time 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.590
 out there a day or two days before you have to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.860
 Argentine who has had a dream 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.069

 in the broadcast has not been 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.630
 working in the right way from 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 the competition even if they have done it 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.870
 from the circuit part really a 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.849
 beautifully drawn very worked very 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.799

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.290

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.700
 Argentine champion who goes in search of 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.560

 the senior category by and so on 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.519
 we begin to share the images 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.439
 while I came beckoning looking 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.319
 to the public doing their show as always 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.959
 giving a great show the pilot 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.510
 Salta being the great figure that has 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.780
 this argentinian championship the commander 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.910
 of the crew of this championship it 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.039
 he took over and I went out to look for a new 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.709
 victory that I had already achieved in the day 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.169
 Saturday 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.450
 sharing the images as we said 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.180
 of the part in the hard text 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.580
 delineated marked on the margins 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.800
 of the dike escaba as well as the cross 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.810
 test about two kilometers and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.160
 medium 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.500
 these two paths will be enjoyed by 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.500
 the public and they were the ones that were 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.900
 timed for the race while 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.860
 after playing this enduro test 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.349
 the pilots 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.220
 they got into a path in a link of 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:57.580
 25 kilometers really very demanding 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.430
 a bond that was undermining the energies 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.430
 that I was putting at all times 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.639
 in discussion the technique of the pilots and 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:11.770
 which of course left them 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.629
 with the energies counted to face 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.660
 the cross test and be able to continue 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.640
 competition 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.940
 on Saturday that had already left the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.760
 triumph of kevin benavides winning all 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.340
 the specials all the enduro test and 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.160
 all the costs as expected 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.670
 Salta pilot took charge of his 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.550
 history and managed to win all 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.380
 tests of the competition being the only 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.290
 pilot in going down the 8 minutes in the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.480
 enduro test of the entire park of almost 90 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.100
 machines said more good than good 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.920
 Benavides second place for the champion 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.450

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.980
 position 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.010
 for martín market that made a great 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.770
 work continues to advance the pilot of 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.810
 alberdi and achieving very good results 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.689
 and this was not the exception almost in 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.669
 the patio of his house 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.889
 the fourth place for Luciano Benavides 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.080
 here we saw it quite controversial 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.809
 on Saturday he was not happy with his 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.339
 labor and the fifth place in a lucid 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:13.099
 performance for the Cordovan tomás 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:15.499
 vigilant who not only achieved a 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.989
 fifth place important for him but 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:19.729
 who had achieved third place in the 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.069
 first cross text I did not enter being 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.409
 the third best time which for him 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.769
 in the debut in this man of the Argentine 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.779
 no doubt that it is a great result without 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.389
 doubt that it is a breakthrough and that 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.929
 of course it deludes a lot to all the 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.929
 Public of Córdoba 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.230
