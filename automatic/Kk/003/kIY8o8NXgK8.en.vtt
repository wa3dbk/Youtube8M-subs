00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.670
 today I'm going to prepare a seafood fideuá 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.020
 for this I need 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.110
 green pepper red pepper garlic 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.480
 little saffron special noodles 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.590
 for the fideuá 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.500
 2 squid prawns 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.510
 I have already prepared 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.150
 previously and in this case I had it 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.450
 frozen 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.670
 clams and mussels a little bit of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.750
 tomato salt coloring home fried 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.750
 onion and olive oil 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 we have washed and scraped with a little knife 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.500
 the husks of the mussels for 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 take away the society that could have 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.780
 now we have put both the clams 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 like the mussels in a pan with a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 waterjet what we will cover now with 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.320
 tape these holes 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.970
 and as they are opened we will go 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.970
 removing a plastic 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.490
 you see how they are opening then 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.490
 we are withdrawing 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 all those mussels or clams that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.939
 do not open we have to throw them away because 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.159
 that means they are not good and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.740
 we could then 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 put the bad ones 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 now let's wait for it to be 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.040
 open all completely for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 reserve it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.820
 we already have all the clams and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 open mussels 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.650
 we start by removing his head and 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.130
 shell to prawns 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 once peeled the prawns the peels 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.130
 We are going to fry them in a pan where 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.410
 we have put a little oil the re 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.660
 fry well crushing the heads 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.890
 so that they release their juice already 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.880
 then we will add the smoke 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.110
 we will prove that it is well of salt 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.120
 glad and we will reserve it in hot 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.050
 because we have to add the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.510
 fideuà being hot the broth already 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.600
 we have well refried the husks of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.900
 the prawns and the heads now let's 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.230
 enter your mail 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.500
 let's cook a few minutes 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.060
 together and we'll try to see how it is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 Salt 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.310
 he has already known a few minutes the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.010
 I smoked with the husks now we're going to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.690
 strain well and hades to take away 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.140
 the foam that it has on the surface 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.660
 here we have already 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.880
 calamari, and in my case, the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.860
 I cut into rings but you can 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.860
 cut them the size and shape that you 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.010
 like 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.590
 we also have the shrimp peeled 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.680
 peas and the already cooked mussels 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.170
 open to steam 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.349
 and here we have a piece of pepper 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.629
 green a piece of red pepper other 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.640
 onion and a clove of garlic all this 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.790
 chopped 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.220
 but let's add the vegetables to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.940
 the game where we have put a little bit 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.240
 of oil and refree we will go well 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.240
 vegetables 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.340
 once it is the vegetables we are going to 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.410
 troceamos incorporate squid 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 poisonous for seas along with 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:57.430
 vegetables and then we will add 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.280
 fried tomato ears almost 2 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.060
 We fry the tomato together with the rest 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.060
 of ingredients 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.720
 let's leave that river a little bit more 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.709
 once it has been reabsorbed and broth 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.590
 both the one that releases the squid and 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.460
 the agüita who had the tomato as 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.250
 now let's incorporate the noodles of 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.670
 the fideuà are royal noodles that 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.830
 they have a central hole and I've 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.110
 put here for other people 200 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.460
 grams now we are going to add them to the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 portfolio and we will refer 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.729
 we will refer a few minutes already 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.470
 then we will incorporate the view of the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.289
 broth that we have we have thus warming up 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.990
 800 milliliters of juice then input 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.630
 I'm going to put half of it and then if it goes 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.110
 in need we will be putting him house in 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.110
 cottage 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.699
 Now let's add to our our 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.570
 fideua a little dye and some 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.570
 saffron 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:24.619
 normally the amount of broth that 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.860
 usually put is twice the amount 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:31.249
 of noodles and a little bit more is to say a 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.499
 little more than twice as much broth but as 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.209
 it's a little to taste is also the texture 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:39.039
 of the noodle if you like it to be a 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:41.330
 little bit more al dente or softer 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.909
 that you have to keep observing what you are going 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.969
 testing if you see that it stays still 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:50.449
 hard and has no broth so we add 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:54.469
 broth if you see that it is already done you stop 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.759
 add it now as it already has 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.249
 how many minutes 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:02.679
 I'm going to put the gambetas on top 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:02.679
 clams and mussels 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.930
 we have prepared all the 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.180
 ingredients in the third 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.130
 I had to add a little more 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.980
 broth because the noodle is not yet 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.700
 done and you know I had not put 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.190
 all perfume that I had reserved 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.370
 then every so often you try 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.840
 a video and if it's already cooked and is 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.530
 your taste then then already left in 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.500
 edit it has to be dry ie 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:41.169
 It is not a dish that has to be left 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:44.740
 It's like if we made a paella 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:48.699
 we have finished the fideuà we have 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.800
 had taking about 20 minutes and not 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.060
 we have thrown all the broth is to say as 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.070
 Better with 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.590
 600 or 700 of sufficient expiration 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:05.350
 now we are going to let it rest for 5 minutes 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.350
 and then to serve
