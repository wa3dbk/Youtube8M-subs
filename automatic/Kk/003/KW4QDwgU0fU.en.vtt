 when we start the individual move we can select to be marine aliens I get 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.510
 all three start from a few facts related 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.530
 taking elements of the first customer hadi turn on their suppliers the brief 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 private management dancing discovers an ancient social pyramid revealing its 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.500
 secrets 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.180
 causes disastrous events that will attract the attention of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.140
 benefits although each of them will affect in a mystical way 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 as a marine we will start the campaign in a rescue mission that will leave 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.870
 complicating trying to survive 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.930
 as if the humor 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.410
 we will locate ourselves in a clandestine laboratory where they have experienced 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.420
 with us 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.980
 end of party to avoid setbacks 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.830
 and finally 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.970
 As a project, the action will start by going in search of other fallen PRI 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 by energy groups fired from the mine 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.410
 p 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.600
 the three victories have more than 22 own songs football is the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.329
 profile to be able to justify the confrontation cc oo

 one or the other offers us three completely different ways and play 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.460
 goodbye to weapons and own actions 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.849
 each of them 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.669
 hoare campaign mode as a sailor resembles a country whisper 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.839
 in the face of criticism, the music faculty was the only thing we could 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.509
 use to end the protests 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.350
 complicated 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.640
 they suspect traps everywhere until that happens extra in search of victims 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.899
 our radar to detect threats will be indispensable 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.819
 the stealthy one that predominates if we prefer to play as a dresser advising to break 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.329
 the lights that attack by surprise 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.229
 this branch is characterized because we can attack by jumping on top of the dam 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.769
 move us through the ceiling hitn electrification walls like this will be done for 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.269
 mislead the enemy to attack with our carranza crossing enemy now with the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.029
 tail 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.489
 otermine I walk with him not even from our jaw on his face to 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.219
 make it more conducive 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.289
 if we take the project surely the most complete option of the three 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.100
 we can use in the nuclear power plant that we bring to the shoulder 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.909
 as a long distance weapon 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.309
 camouflage them by environment making temporary use of invisibility using the 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.309
 different sensors attack stealthily null white votes 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.870
 placing traps in chemical environments lopez efe 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.499
 leaving the dying or the enemies we can finish them from different 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.499
 ways 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.840
 the three batteries can be covered with the top buttons or push your 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.509
 enemy can be superior 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.079
 what can give us a few vital seconds to start distributing bast 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.169
 the temper that is very active thanks to a good time because it develops 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.099
 the action 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.929
 managed to convey a constant sense of danger throughout the 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:49.939
 Bell 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.120
 almost all forms of the ends of both areas are reflected in this game 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:58.349
 perhaps of the benefits the most difficult to control despite the breath 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.109
 alcove the ones by the walls 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.379
 the campaign mode of each of them is imperative propagation hours but 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.789
 remember that we are offered three campaign modes different duration 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.099
 exceeding then the average 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.789
 conventional lucifer 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.539
 if the campaign mode was not enough we have a south mode dancing 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.539
 in which we must survive aol and become rich 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.669
 the multiplayer mode offers the same experience post its cold to what 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.479
 seven campaigns get all multiplayer modes highlight pests in the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.979
 that an alien will face seven sailors turning the morphos sinus 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.620
 all those who touch 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.029
 so the last infidel husband sigali 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.639
 mixture of races by teams in which both sides are members of the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.810
 terraces hp or parents 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.529
 clashes with another race compensation 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.520
 in addition to battles to death for example 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.499
 in addition to the title team in all game modes 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.469
 also stands out for the honor with a really good dubbing and for his 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.699
 graphic section 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.639
 goals pt proxied textures and do not take much of the avoidance vary 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.490
 I started but as it is a bit demanding and we want to apply all the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.120
 effects and textured als 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.219
 with the rest 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.219
 the perceptions are recases and what was 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.550
 aliens of suffering hector is a perfectly finished product round in all 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.620
 the aspects 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.039
 and technically 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:20.879
 outstanding
