year league title I think that would be
a<00:00:58.859> very<00:00:59.010> fitting<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> end<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.910> series<00:01:00.270> with

here<00:02:52.500> don't<00:02:53.500> look<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.799> low<00:02:53.950> cross<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
here don't look for that low cross and

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.000 
here don't look for that low cross and
right<00:02:55.000> at<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.269> keeper<00:02:55.959> though<00:02:56.170> probably

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
right at the keeper though probably

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.199 
right at the keeper though probably
should<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.280> done<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.549> ground<00:02:57.760> cross<00:02:58.030> but

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
should have done the ground cross but

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.000
