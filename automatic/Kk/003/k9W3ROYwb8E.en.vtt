games<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.170> house<00:00:42.320> side<00:00:42.620> push<00:00:42.949> on<00:00:43.220> Duke<00:00:43.610> now<00:00:44.390> they

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
games a house side push on Duke now they

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.969 
games a house side push on Duke now they
do<00:00:44.570> those<00:00:44.780> for<00:00:44.930> three<00:00:45.080> people<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:45.799> it's

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
do those for three people so it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.920 
do those for three people so it's
obviously<00:00:46.460> gonna<00:00:46.670> leave<00:00:46.850> upper<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.510> ramp<00:00:47.750> a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
obviously gonna leave upper and ramp a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.619 
obviously gonna leave upper and ramp a
little<00:00:48.290> bit<00:00:48.440> vulnerable<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:49.699> it's<00:00:50.390> pretty

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
little bit vulnerable but it's pretty

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.990 
little bit vulnerable but it's pretty
mats<00:00:51.339> they<00:00:52.339> don't<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:52.610> use<00:00:52.790> many

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
mats they don't really use many

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700 
mats they don't really use many
resources<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:53.930> not<00:00:54.049> much<00:00:54.229> of<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.470> tell

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
resources so it's not much of a tell

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.609 
resources so it's not much of a tell
that<00:00:54.979> they<00:00:55.100> are<00:00:55.220> stacked<00:00:55.549> outside<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.619> I

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
that they are stacked outside and I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:58.840 
that they are stacked outside and I
guarantee<00:00:57.890> you're<00:00:58.100> gonna<00:00:58.190> trap<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.549> lot<00:00:58.729> of

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
guarantee you're gonna trap a lot of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.579 
guarantee you're gonna trap a lot of
people<00:00:59.059> with<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.449> try<00:00:59.720> if<00:00:59.989> you<00:01:00.140> choose<00:01:00.470> to

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
people with this try if you choose to

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.829 
people with this try if you choose to
use<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:01.760> it's<00:01:02.000> really<00:01:02.360> really<00:01:02.690> good

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
use it and it's it's really really good

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.620 
use it and it's it's really really good
so<00:01:03.379> first<00:01:04.010> let's<00:01:04.519> take<00:01:04.670> an<00:01:04.820> overhead<00:01:05.150> look<00:01:05.420> at

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
so first let's take an overhead look at

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.110 
so first let's take an overhead look at
it<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:10.100> again<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:10.790> don't<00:01:10.880> need<00:01:11.000> many

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
it so again you don't need many

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.770 
it so again you don't need many
resources<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:12.350> should<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.620> smoke<00:01:13.100> a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
resources you should use a smoke a

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.360 
resources you should use a smoke a
flashbang<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.110> then<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.680> rest<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.220> could

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
flashbang and then the rest you could

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.610 
flashbang and then the rest you could
just<00:01:16.550> have<00:01:16.700> guns<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:18.050> good<00:01:18.230> if<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.380> have<00:01:18.470> an

late just pushes to the right of this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.449 
late just pushes to the right of this
smoke<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:30.230> actually<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> smoke<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> t's

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
smoke that's actually a smoke up the t's

smoke that's actually a smoke up the t's
through<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.090> one<00:02:32.239> up<00:02:32.360> front<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.780> think<00:02:32.870> they

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
through the one up front I think they

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890 
through the one up front I think they
missed<00:02:33.260> Aires<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.180> same<00:02:35.720> thing

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
missed Aires but the the same thing

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.110 
missed Aires but the the same thing
applies<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.500> simply<00:02:36.830> push<00:02:37.130> right<00:02:37.400> off<00:02:37.580> right

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
applies you simply push right off right

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
applies you simply push right off right
next<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.420> mini<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.470> right<00:02:39.680> underneath<00:02:39.860> ela

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
next to mini and go right underneath ela

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.270 
next to mini and go right underneath ela
all<00:02:42.140> right<00:02:42.260> finally<00:02:42.590> let's<00:02:42.800> take<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:42.980> look<00:02:43.190> at

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
all right finally let's take a look at

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 
all right finally let's take a look at
Smith's<00:02:43.730> who's<00:02:44.690> gonna<00:02:44.810> use<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.110> ought<00:02:45.260> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
Smith's who's gonna use this ought to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.560 
Smith's who's gonna use this ought to
cover<00:02:45.560> yellow<00:02:45.950> throws<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> smoke<00:02:47.300> for<00:02:47.450> his

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
existence remember and as you can see

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.199 
existence remember and as you can see
those<00:02:52.940> pre<00:02:53.120> native<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.050> something<00:02:54.380> damage<00:02:55.209> and

teammates single-shot tonight let's take
a<00:03:02.180> look<00:03:02.330> at<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.569> from<00:03:02.750> forces<00:03:03.260> point<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.530> view

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
a look at it from forces point of view

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.410 
a look at it from forces point of view
trust<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.550> forest<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.120> isn't

my smoke they threw it on purpose
this<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.280> forest<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.630> can<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:14.750> you

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
this is forest and as you can see you

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.660 
this is forest and as you can see you
try<00:03:15.049> pushing<00:03:15.380> past<00:03:15.650> things<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.430> gets

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
try pushing past things and this gets

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.810 
try pushing past things and this gets
annihilated<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.040> last<00:03:19.220> point<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.579> view<00:03:19.700> is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
annihilated in the last point of view is

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.640 
annihilated in the last point of view is
for<00:03:20.000> farm<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.750> let's<00:03:20.870> take<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.049> look<00:03:21.200> at<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.500> he

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
for farm so let's take a look at what he

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.569 
for farm so let's take a look at what he
is<00:03:21.799> doing<00:03:23.769> how<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.890> looks<00:03:25.040> from<00:03:25.130> his<00:03:25.250> point<00:03:25.459> of

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
is doing how it looks from his point of

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.720 
is doing how it looks from his point of
view<00:03:27.040> finally<00:03:28.040> let's<00:03:28.220> take<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.370> look<00:03:28.519> at<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
view finally let's take a look at the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.280 
view finally let's take a look at the
foreign<00:03:31.450> somebody<00:03:32.450> gets<00:03:32.600> annihilated<00:03:32.780> didn't

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
foreign somebody gets annihilated didn't

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.410 
foreign somebody gets annihilated didn't
have<00:03:33.380> much<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.709> chance<00:03:33.890> try<00:03:34.850> taking<00:03:35.150> us<00:03:35.299> out

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
have much of a chance try taking us out

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.370 
have much of a chance try taking us out
of<00:03:35.480> existence

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
of existence

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.759

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
nades that are probably pointing outside

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.090 
nades that are probably pointing outside

comfort zone and you have that

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.050 
comfort zone and you have that
information<00:05:40.220> to<00:05:40.550> work<00:05:40.760> with

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
information to work with

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.130 
information to work with
it's<00:05:41.450> gonna<00:05:41.570> help<00:05:41.780> your<00:05:41.930> team<00:05:42.050> out

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
tremendously because once they work

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.060 
tremendously because once they work
outside<00:05:44.060> times<00:05:45.050> are<00:05:45.230> gonna<00:05:45.320> be<00:05:45.500> dueling<00:05:45.890> down

outside times are gonna be dueling down

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.130 
outside times are gonna be dueling down
you're<00:05:46.850> gonna<00:05:46.970> pigeonhole<00:05:47.510> them<00:05:47.540> into<00:05:47.900> only<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
you're gonna pigeonhole them into only a

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.330 
you're gonna pigeonhole them into only a
certain<00:05:48.440> amount<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.680> strategies<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.130> they

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
certain amount of strategies that they

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.890 
certain amount of strategies that they
can<00:05:49.370> run<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:49.910> you're<00:05:50.390> really<00:05:50.600> just<00:05:50.720> gonna

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
can run and you're really just gonna

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.320 
can run and you're really just gonna
help<00:05:51.080> them<00:05:51.350> or<00:05:51.650> something<00:05:52.010> from<00:05:52.430> using<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.210> lot

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
help them or something from using a lot

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.240 
help them or something from using a lot
of<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.540> clock<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:54.530> they<00:05:54.680> had<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:55.040> work<00:05:55.190> with

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
of the clock that they had to work with

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.500 
of the clock that they had to work with
so<00:05:57.070> again<00:05:58.070> once<00:05:58.580> you<00:05:58.670> take<00:05:58.850> outside<00:05:59.120> control

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
so again once you take outside control

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.570 
so again once you take outside control
like<00:05:59.660> this<00:05:59.840> what<00:06:00.350> I<00:06:00.380> would<00:06:00.590> advise<00:06:00.920> you<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.370> do
