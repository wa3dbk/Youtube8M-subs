00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
26 and this hand is pretty good I mean

26 and this hand is pretty good I mean
if<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.509> run<00:00:15.719> island<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> hand<00:00:16.230> would<00:00:16.320> be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
if this run island the hand would be

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250 
if this run island the hand would be
basically<00:00:16.710> perfect<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.970> mean<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.109> not

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
basically perfect but I mean it's not

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.060 
basically perfect but I mean it's not
going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.560> much<00:00:19.710> better<00:00:19.920> than<00:00:19.980> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
going to get much better than this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:32.540 
going to get much better than this
anyway<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> keep<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:31.460> not<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
anyway so I'm going to keep this not the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.389 
anyway so I'm going to keep this not the
best<00:00:32.730> draw<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.739> again<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> hunt<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.160> pretty

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
best draw but again the hunt is pretty

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
good as long as I draw a third land but

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
good as long as I draw a third land but
even<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> don't<00:00:38.340> understa<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.210> shikari<00:00:39.660> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
if you're in green and add a little slow

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
blip downwash will open their but my

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.070 
blip downwash will open their but my
mode<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> suddenly<00:01:12.060> slowed<00:01:12.390> down<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> second

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
mode I suddenly slowed down for a second

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.410

might<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.490> my<00:01:17.490> computer's<00:01:17.970> fairly<00:01:18.299> old

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
might be that my computer's fairly old

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.859 
might be that my computer's fairly old
and<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.439> struggling<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> handle<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.720> bunch<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and it's struggling to handle a bunch of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.730 
and it's struggling to handle a bunch of
open<00:01:22.110> applications<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> Camtasia<00:01:27.530> if<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
open applications and Camtasia if the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
open applications and Camtasia if the
lagging<00:01:29.100> continues<00:01:29.579> I'll<00:01:29.790> pause<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
lagging continues I'll pause the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
lagging continues I'll pause the
recording<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.650> close<00:01:31.799> down<00:01:32.009> some

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
recording and go and close down some

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.270 
recording and go and close down some
applications<00:01:34.369> yeah<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
applications yeah that's pretty good I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
applications yeah that's pretty good I
was<00:01:38.280> gonna<00:01:38.369> play<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> sense<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.350> fact

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
was gonna play the sense of this in fact

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
was gonna play the sense of this in fact
now<00:01:40.799> probably<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.280> played<00:01:41.460> late

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
now probably would have played late

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
now probably would have played late
opinions<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.920> during<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> glint<00:01:44.220> hawk<00:01:44.310> idle

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
opinions but during the glint hawk idle

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
opinions but during the glint hawk idle
means<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.909> play<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> instead<00:01:45.619> my<00:01:46.619> opponents

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
means I play that instead my opponents

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
means I play that instead my opponents
not<00:01:47.220> putting<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.700> much<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> fight<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.839 
so hopefully that Marta Beach doesn't
start<00:02:29.180> racing<00:02:29.329> me<00:02:29.629> because<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.109> he<00:02:30.230> kills<00:02:30.469> my

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
start racing me because if he kills my

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.039 
start racing me because if he kills my
couldn't<00:02:31.849> Hokkaido<00:02:32.209> next<00:02:32.569> turn<00:02:32.750> then<00:02:32.959> he

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
couldn't Hokkaido next turn then he

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.849 
couldn't Hokkaido next turn then he
probably<00:02:33.349> can<00:02:33.650> start<00:02:33.950> racing<00:02:34.099> me<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:36.409> it

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
probably can start racing me but as it

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.860 
probably can start racing me but as it
stands<00:02:37.159> I've<00:02:37.670> won<00:02:37.939> it<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.150> two<00:02:38.299> turns<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.780> he

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
stands I've won it in two turns if he

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.300 
stands I've won it in two turns if he
doesn't<00:02:39.109> have<00:02:39.230> anything<00:02:45.159> would<00:02:46.159> be<00:02:46.189> better

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
doesn't have anything would be better

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
doesn't have anything would be better
not<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.639> lose<00:02:46.939> a<00:02:46.970> guy<00:02:47.060> who<00:02:47.239> makes<00:02:48.109> his<00:02:48.290> first

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
not to lose a guy who makes his first

not to lose a guy who makes his first
creature<00:02:49.099> on<00:02:49.280> town<00:02:49.489> five<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:51.579> haven't

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
creature on town five but I haven't

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.940 
creature on town five but I haven't
really<00:02:52.760> drawn<00:02:53.060> much<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.290> my<00:02:54.590> starting

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
really drawn much out of my starting

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.629 
really drawn much out of my starting
hand<00:02:55.099> anyway<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:56.560> bunch<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.739> happy<00:02:58.489> blue<00:02:58.639> smells

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
hand anyway a bunch of happy blue smells

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.119 
hand anyway a bunch of happy blue smells
and<00:03:01.810> there's<00:03:02.810> no<00:03:03.049> reason<00:03:03.409> not<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:03.859> this<00:03:03.950> is

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
and there's no reason not to do this is

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:14.589 
and there's no reason not to do this is
10<00:03:09.760> yeah<00:03:10.760> I'll<00:03:10.939> just<00:03:11.120> keep<00:03:11.299> doing<00:03:11.510> this<00:03:13.599> make

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
10 yeah I'll just keep doing this make

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:27.189 
10 yeah I'll just keep doing this make
this<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.870> guy<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.319> bash<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:27.049> he<00:03:27.109> has

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
this a guy and bash you I think he has

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.229 
this a guy and bash you I think he has
slicing<00:03:27.439> twine<00:03:27.799> he's<00:03:28.430> got<00:03:28.609> form<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.030> for

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
slicing twine he's got form and for

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.460 
slicing twine he's got form and for
green<00:03:29.419> manner<00:03:29.629> up<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:29.989> i<00:03:30.019> don't<00:03:30.229> think<00:03:30.379> i'll

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
green manner up but i don't think i'll

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.719 
green manner up but i don't think i'll
slice<00:03:30.650> into<00:03:30.829> a<00:03:30.919> super<00:03:31.250> would<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.519> done<00:03:31.639> it

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
slice into a super would have done it

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.189 
slice into a super would have done it
last<00:03:31.849> turn<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> he<00:03:33.049> can<00:03:33.819> push<00:03:34.819> through

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
last turn so that he can push through

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.099 
last turn so that he can push through
extra<00:03:36.199> damage<00:03:36.349> with<00:03:36.620> mold<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.889> beast<00:03:37.069> that

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
extra damage with mold a beast that

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.280 
extra damage with mold a beast that
seems<00:03:39.109> like<00:03:39.259> a<00:03:39.470> better<00:03:39.620> play<00:03:39.949> than<00:03:41.229> doing<00:03:42.229> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
seems like a better play than doing it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.360 
seems like a better play than doing it
during<00:03:42.409> my<00:03:42.620> 10<00:03:42.829> because<00:03:42.979> I<00:03:43.069> mean<00:03:43.250> he's

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
during my 10 because I mean he's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.789 
during my 10 because I mean he's

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
the game let me know that you could draw

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.069 
the game let me know that you could draw
removal<00:04:04.310> spell<00:04:04.519> but<00:04:04.819> he<00:04:05.569> always<00:04:05.689> just<00:04:05.870> had<00:04:06.049> a

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
removal spell but he always just had a

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.240 
removal spell but he always just had a
terrible<00:04:06.259> drawer<00:04:06.650> which<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.889> nice<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.189> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
terrible drawer which is nice in the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.629 
terrible drawer which is nice in the
finals<00:04:07.609> but<00:04:07.879> I'm<00:04:08.030> not<00:04:08.150> going<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.329> complain

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
finals but I'm not going to complain

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.309 
finals but I'm not going to complain
what<00:04:10.639> do<00:04:10.759> I<00:04:10.819> want<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.780> probably<00:04:12.079> might<00:04:12.199> be

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
what do I want to so probably might be

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.629 
what do I want to so probably might be
good<00:04:12.409> against<00:04:12.650> him<00:04:12.769> if<00:04:12.859> he's<00:04:12.979> got<00:04:13.159> some<00:04:13.430> big

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
good against him if he's got some big

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.569 
good against him if he's got some big
green<00:04:13.879> guys<00:04:14.560> it's<00:04:15.560> like<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.709> fog<00:04:16.039> but<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> bit

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
green guys it's like a fog but a bit

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.900 
green guys it's like a fog but a bit
better

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.270 

what<00:04:19.910> would<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.060> bring<00:04:20.359> out<00:04:23.800> possibly<00:04:24.800> the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
what would I bring out possibly the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.510 
what would I bring out possibly the
other<00:04:25.910> two<00:04:26.090> 2<00:04:26.270> i'm<00:04:27.229> getting<00:04:27.800> metalcraft<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.340> lot

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
other two 2 i'm getting metalcraft a lot

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.689 
other two 2 i'm getting metalcraft a lot
less<00:04:28.669> often<00:04:28.849> than<00:04:28.970> i<00:04:29.150> was<00:04:29.270> expecting<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.810> which

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
less often than i was expecting to which

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.129 
less often than i was expecting to which
makes<00:04:31.699> sense<00:04:31.910> with<00:04:32.120> any<00:04:32.270> nine<00:04:32.539> artifacts<00:04:32.990> i

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
makes sense with any nine artifacts i

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.510 
makes sense with any nine artifacts i
guess<00:04:33.319> i<00:04:33.500> have<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.650> draw<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> third<00:04:34.069> of<00:04:34.099> them<00:04:34.340> and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
guess i have to draw a third of them and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.390 
guess i have to draw a third of them and
two<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.639> them<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.000> spell<00:04:35.270> bombs<00:04:35.509> and<00:04:36.280> two<00:04:37.280> of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
two of them the spell bombs and two of

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
two of them the spell bombs and two of
them<00:04:37.490> accrete<00:04:37.940> no<00:04:38.180> three<00:04:38.539> of<00:04:38.569> them<00:04:38.750> are

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
them accrete no three of them are

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.070 
them accrete no three of them are
creatures<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.560> are<00:04:39.949> happy<00:04:40.759> to<00:04:40.880> die<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.870> yeah

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
creatures that are happy to die so yeah

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.460 
creatures that are happy to die so yeah
and<00:04:42.319> I'll<00:04:43.220> try<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.940> think<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.900> tutu<00:04:45.229> will<00:04:45.349> be

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
and I'll try this I think a tutu will be

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.409 
and I'll try this I think a tutu will be
not<00:04:45.919> going<00:04:46.130> against<00:04:46.310> them<00:04:46.550> I'd<00:04:47.030> rather<00:04:47.210> have

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
not going against them I'd rather have

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.110 
not going against them I'd rather have
the<00:04:47.509> unblockable<00:04:47.870> ones
