that and we don't want to do that and

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.830 
that and we don't want to do that and
this<00:04:31.949> is<00:04:32.400> actually<00:04:32.639> really<00:04:32.910> good<00:04:33.330> vehicle<00:04:33.630> for

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
this is actually really good vehicle for

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.420 
this is actually really good vehicle for
off-road<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.620> far<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.070> lot<00:04:35.280> better

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
off-road and so far this is a lot better

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.360 
off-road and so far this is a lot better
than<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.759> comment<00:04:36.180> was<00:04:37.099> actually<00:04:38.099> figured

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
than the comment was actually figured

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.860 
than the comment was actually figured
it'd<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.639> little<00:04:38.759> harder<00:04:39.150> than<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.419> comment

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
it'd be a little harder than the comment

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.510 
it'd be a little harder than the comment
but<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.560> haven't<00:04:40.680> gotten<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.099> hard<00:04:41.130> part

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
but we haven't gotten to the hard part

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:52.640 
but we haven't gotten to the hard part
yet<00:04:41.699> oh<00:04:48.860> all<00:04:49.860> right<00:04:51.110> things<00:04:52.110> are<00:04:52.289> going

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
yet oh all right things are going

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.219 
yet oh all right things are going
smoother<00:04:53.159> than<00:04:53.340> expected<00:04:53.970> yeah<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.199> can

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
smoother than expected yeah if I can

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.040 
smoother than expected yeah if I can
keep<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.740> thing<00:04:55.949> in<00:04:56.009> one<00:04:56.130> piece<00:04:56.840> we<00:04:57.840> might

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
keep this thing in one piece we might

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.070 
keep this thing in one piece we might
actually<00:04:58.229> try<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.710> go<00:04:59.130> up<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.430> hard<00:05:00.090> way<00:05:00.330> with

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
actually try and go up the hard way with

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
another one and go up the hard way you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.180 
another one and go up the hard way you
might<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.729> go<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:07.169> hard<00:05:07.740> way<00:05:07.919> with<00:05:08.159> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
might have to go the hard way with a
