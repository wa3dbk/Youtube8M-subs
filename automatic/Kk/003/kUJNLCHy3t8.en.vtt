work with fancy that anyway this is the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.350 
work with fancy that anyway this is the
other<00:03:40.210> part<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.810> what<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.050> don't<00:03:41.290> think<00:03:41.530> Seurat

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
other part of what I don't think Seurat

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
emphasized in his rant that actually is

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.620 
emphasized in his rant that actually is
probably<00:03:47.290> more<00:03:48.070> important<00:03:48.610> in<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.880> first<00:03:49.360> bit

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
probably more important in the first bit

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.480 
probably more important in the first bit
will<00:03:50.230> be<00:03:50.380> not<00:03:50.530> more<00:03:50.710> important<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.400> it

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
will be not more important but it

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:03.660 
will be not more important but it
certainly<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:52.060> an<00:03:52.780> importance
