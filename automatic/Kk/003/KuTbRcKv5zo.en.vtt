00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
made the decision to you know kind of

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.410 
made the decision to you know kind of
put<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:54.860> couple<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.250> horses<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.880> homes<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.329> I

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
put a couple of horses and homes that I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.639 
put a couple of horses and homes that I
thought<00:00:56.630> would<00:00:56.750> be<00:00:56.809> quite<00:00:57.079> good<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.500> then

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
thought would be quite good and then

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.620 
thought would be quite good and then
think<00:00:58.579> about<00:00:58.670> how<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.969> wanted<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.420> have<00:00:59.600> a

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
think about how I wanted to have a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.750 
think about how I wanted to have a
certain<00:00:59.870> quality<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.530> horse<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.610> had

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
certain quality of horse so that I had

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.689 
certain quality of horse so that I had
hopefully<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.809> few<00:01:03.680> pings<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.159> not<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.519> one

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
hopefully a few pings and not just one

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.730 
hopefully a few pings and not just one
and<00:01:04.969> the<00:01:05.570> lovely<00:01:05.869> horses<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.380> had<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.619> run

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
and the lovely horses that I had to run

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.739 
and the lovely horses that I had to run
advanced<00:01:07.159> on<00:01:07.280> last<00:01:07.490> year<00:01:07.670> were<00:01:07.819> fantastic<00:01:08.539> for

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
advanced on last year were fantastic for

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:11.230 
advanced on last year were fantastic for
mileage<00:01:09.139> but<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:09.859> know<00:01:09.950> I<00:01:09.979> think<00:01:10.130> due<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
mileage but you know I think due to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.629 
mileage but you know I think due to
either<00:01:11.420> injuries<00:01:12.079> or<00:01:12.289> or<00:01:12.469> where<00:01:13.249> they<00:01:13.429> needed

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
either injuries or or where they needed

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.099 
either injuries or or where they needed
to<00:01:13.759> be<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:13.939> levels<00:01:14.329> it<00:01:14.450> was<00:01:14.569> better<00:01:14.749> suited

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
to be in levels it was better suited

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.349 
to be in levels it was better suited

gaps<00:03:20.180> between<00:03:20.419> everyone<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:21.530> really

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
gaps between everyone and I'm really

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.770 
gaps between everyone and I'm really
thrilled<00:03:22.609> for<00:03:22.790> him<00:03:22.909> to<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.150> rotting<00:03:23.510> her<00:03:23.599> and

thrilled for him to be rotting her and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.349 
thrilled for him to be rotting her and
he<00:03:23.870> came<00:03:23.989> out<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.319> practice<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.760> they<00:03:26.180> get

gonna be fun and I think it's a good
horse<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.449> I<00:03:29.569> think<00:03:29.780> Caroline<00:03:30.139> Martin<00:03:30.440> might

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699

so we'll have to see anything we're

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.229 
so we'll have to see anything we're
gonna<00:03:42.409> share<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.859> video<00:03:43.099> really<00:03:43.579> jumping<00:03:44.150> oh

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
gonna share the video really jumping oh

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.520 
gonna share the video really jumping oh
that<00:03:44.510> was<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.690> first<00:03:44.900> time<00:03:45.079> we'd<00:03:45.199> ever<00:03:45.260> jump

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
that was the first time we'd ever jump

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.530 
that was the first time we'd ever jump
to<00:03:45.590> show<00:03:45.739> John<00:03:45.919> is<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.190> way<00:03:46.340> no<00:03:46.729> I<00:03:46.849> think<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
to show John is that way no I think I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.780 
to show John is that way no I think I
think<00:03:47.569> his<00:03:48.349> show<00:03:48.590> jumping<00:03:48.979> experience<00:03:49.579> is

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
think his show jumping experience is

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.189 
think his show jumping experience is
fairly<00:03:50.150> limited<00:03:50.299> from<00:03:50.690> what<00:03:50.810> he's<00:03:50.930> told<00:03:51.079> me

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
fairly limited from what he's told me

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:57.309 
fairly limited from what he's told me
but<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.620> think<00:03:52.159> for<00:03:52.819> sure<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.959> we<00:03:57.109> go

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
but I think for sure so there we go

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.770 
but I think for sure so there we go
biding<00:03:57.859> that's<00:03:58.069> right<00:03:58.430> Caroline<00:03:59.209> develop<00:03:59.629> a

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
biding that's right Caroline develop a
