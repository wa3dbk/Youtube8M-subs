00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
strong like chocolate either let's try

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.599 
strong like chocolate either let's try
it<00:02:49.099> hmm<00:02:52.549> same<00:02:53.549> texture<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.659> crumbly<00:02:55.109> texture

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
it hmm same texture that crumbly texture

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.440 
it hmm same texture that crumbly texture
very<00:02:56.609> sweet<00:02:57.799> maybe<00:02:58.799> very<00:02:59.340> very<00:02:59.790> subtly

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
very sweet maybe very very subtly

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.610 
very sweet maybe very very subtly
chocolate<00:03:03.560> very<00:03:04.560> subtle<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:06.319> think<00:03:07.319> if<00:03:07.409> someone

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
chocolate very subtle I think if someone

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.830 
chocolate very subtle I think if someone
were<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.099> give<00:03:08.220> me<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:10.200> wouldn't<00:03:10.650> even

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
were to give me this and I wouldn't even

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.449 
were to give me this and I wouldn't even
without<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.109> label<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.650> wouldn't<00:03:14.340> even

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
without the label I wouldn't even

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.479 
without the label I wouldn't even
