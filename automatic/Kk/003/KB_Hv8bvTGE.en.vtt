00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
like the the wood shop at work the scrap

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
like the the wood shop at work the scrap
wood<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.829> use<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.909> some<00:01:42.150> small

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
wood that they use and I have some small

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.550 
wood that they use and I have some small
wood<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> split<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.299> regular<00:01:46.259> logs

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
wood that I split also here regular logs

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.969 
wood that I split also here regular logs
so<00:01:47.460> between<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.299> bucket<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.619> rocket

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so between this bucket and the rocket

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
so between this bucket and the rocket
stove<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> rocket<00:01:51.750> stove<00:01:51.960> cooks<00:01:52.320> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
stove the way the rocket stove cooks I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.510 
stove the way the rocket stove cooks I
could<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.250> several<00:01:54.500> meals<00:01:55.500> worth<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.490> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
could get several meals worth out of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420 
could get several meals worth out of
this<00:01:56.759> bucket<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> rocket<00:01:58.649> stove<00:01:58.890> cooking

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this bucket on the rocket stove cooking

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
this bucket on the rocket stove cooking
boiling<00:01:59.909> water

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
boiling water

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.139 
boiling water
whatever<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.719> had<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
whatever I had to do so and then it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.560 
whatever I had to do so and then it
would<00:02:03.360> obviously<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.329> wood

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
would obviously go and you know cut wood

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.559 
would obviously go and you know cut wood
or<00:02:06.719> forage<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.320> wood<00:02:07.560> after<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.700> let's

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
or forage for wood after that so let's

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.009 
or forage for wood after that so let's
get<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> close-up<00:02:10.019> here<00:02:10.229> I'll<00:02:10.979> show<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.280> guys

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
get a close-up here I'll show you guys

round you could adjust that you can even

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.140 
round you could adjust that you can even
bring<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.740> down<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.220> simmer<00:04:47.550> by<00:04:47.820> shutting

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
that door all the way and so we got two

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.440 
that door all the way and so we got two
nights<00:04:52.260> carry<00:04:52.560> handles<00:04:53.040> on<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.760> sides<00:04:54.000> here

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
nights carry handles on the sides here

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.190 
nights carry handles on the sides here
so<00:04:55.200> my<00:04:56.130> answer<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.540> subscriber<00:04:58.470> would<00:04:59.310> be

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
so my answer to that subscriber would be

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.600 
so my answer to that subscriber would be
something<00:05:01.200> like<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.680> rocket<00:05:02.070> stove<00:05:02.310> that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
something like the rocket stove that

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.110 
something like the rocket stove that
uses<00:05:03.060> wood<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.860> biofuel<00:05:04.880> which<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.000> could

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
uses wood a biofuel which you could

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.990 
uses wood a biofuel which you could
forage<00:05:06.390> for<00:05:06.750> out<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.230> field<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:08.100> get<00:05:08.760> and

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
forage for out in the field and get and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.440 
forage for out in the field and get and
collect<00:05:10.490> that's<00:05:11.490> what<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.940> would<00:05:12.060> use<00:05:12.240> as<00:05:12.419> a

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
backup well you could even use this as a

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.400 
backup well you could even use this as a
