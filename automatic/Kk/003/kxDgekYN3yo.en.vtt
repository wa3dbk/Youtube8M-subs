00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.560 
next game and whatever what I have our
so<00:04:11.920> I've<00:04:12.370> been<00:04:12.519> doing<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.790> lot<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.970> short<00:04:13.269> vlogs

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
so I've been doing a lot of short vlogs

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.469 
so I've been doing a lot of short vlogs
lately<00:04:14.019> but<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.260> think<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.560> reason<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:15.010> because

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
lately but I think the reason is because

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.880 
lately but I think the reason is because
usually<00:04:16.479> when<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.870> do<00:04:16.959> longer<00:04:17.350> vlogs<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.799> have

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
usually when I do longer vlogs I have

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.830 
usually when I do longer vlogs I have
more<00:04:18.010> time<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.370> think<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.880> less<00:04:19.239> time<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.600> do

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
more time to think and less time to do

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.770 
more time to think and less time to do
unless<00:04:20.489> doing<00:04:21.489> but<00:04:21.910> I've<00:04:22.000> just<00:04:22.120> been<00:04:22.300> doing

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
unless doing but I've just been doing

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.050 
unless doing but I've just been doing
too<00:04:23.650> much<00:04:23.860> where<00:04:24.190> there's<00:04:24.370> been<00:04:24.550> less<00:04:24.700> time<00:04:24.940> to

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
too much where there's been less time to

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.960 
too much where there's been less time to
think<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.479> express<00:04:25.960> feelings<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.650> talk

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
think in express feelings and talk

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.480 
think in express feelings and talk
and<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:28.050> know<00:04:28.170> I've<00:04:28.260> just<00:04:28.290> been<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:29.310> it's

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
and you know I've just been and it's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
and you know I've just been and it's
been<00:04:29.640> solid<00:04:30.090> things<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.510> we<00:04:30.660> were<00:04:30.840> doing

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
been solid things like we were doing

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.420 
been solid things like we were doing
that<00:04:31.200> shoot<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.590> six<00:04:31.770> hours<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.280> wasn't

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
that shoot for six hours so I wasn't

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.650 
that shoot for six hours so I wasn't
going<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.670> keep<00:04:32.820> coming<00:04:33.000> back<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> shoot

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
going to keep coming back to the shoot

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.390 
going to keep coming back to the shoot
although<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.900> could<00:04:34.200> have<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.530> should<00:04:35.010> have<00:04:35.100> but

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
although I could have I should have but

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.670 
although I could have I should have but
anyway<00:04:35.730> hence<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.540> short<00:04:36.840> vlogs<00:04:37.080> don't<00:04:37.440> worry

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
anyway hence the short vlogs don't worry

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.970 
anyway hence the short vlogs don't worry
they<00:04:38.100> shall<00:04:38.400> get<00:04:38.610> longer<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.590> I'm<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:40.770> sure

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980
