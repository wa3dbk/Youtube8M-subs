00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 video again with a genius is bigtv 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.420
 7204 of how to book it I'll do it here 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.540
 an example and again here you will see 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 the whole process because as in the other 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590
 video had already begun the process 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.289
 this time I will show from the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.109
 start here the genres have these buttons 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.279
 here on top of reset the volume and the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.090
 disconnect 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.019
 you press the volume more and off 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.019
 same time 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 boy this message a message here at 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.289
 red 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.840
 then I grip debt button will 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.390
 appear to recur and yellow 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 which bout then exist occur soon 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.190
 I'll repeat you press the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 turn off the volume knob and the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.530
 same time to appear only leave 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.869
 asking if you want to do this? 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.479
 same process you will look like you should 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.390
 according to him he will cancel to tighten you up 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.119
 press the power button on and off 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 new one and press it ready only in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 Yellow appeal confirmed always ready 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.049
 remembering the past of this process is that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 is totally off 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.290
 You hang up and give it a little time and talk. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.009
 this process 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.009
 pressed 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.500
 He is going to start calling. It takes a while. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.420
 Why are you reinventing me? 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 seems gene a symbol of everything normal 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.790
 there is no mystery at all that he goes 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 take a while because it 's the first time 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 that he would be again, right? 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.470
 Then I cut the video because it took 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.470
 a little there than expected 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.369
 under optimism of the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.110
 simple and ready applications 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.979
 I'll cut the video again, I'll go 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.979
 show connected 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.650
 what the people were turned off 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.650
 and that's worth
