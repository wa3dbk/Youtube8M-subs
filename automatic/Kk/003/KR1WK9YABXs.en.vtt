00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.139
WELL, ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME AT
ALL KNOWS THAT I AM SELDOM FOUND
WITHOUT A CUP OF COFFEE CLOSE

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.709
BY.
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE RANDY'S

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.614
REACTION WHEN HE SAW THAT A
LOCAL MAN HAD BEEN NAMED THE
WORLD'S BEST BARISTA.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:19.619
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEARD THAT
TO WIN THE AWARD YOU BASICALLY
HAVE TO BREW AND SERVE A WORLD

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.661
CLASS CUB O JOE WHILE GIVING THE
BEST SPEECH OF YOUR LIFE.
PAPA -- THE BARISTA IN

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.998
QUESTION IS PETE LICATA, QUALITY
ASSURANCE MANAGER FOR PARISI
BROTHERS COFFEE.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:38.675
RANDY AND BROWSER JUSTIN BOND
FOUND HIM WORKING THE COUNTER IN
UNION STATION.

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:43.614
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF
A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.
WELL, THERE IS A LOT OF

00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:50.287
REPETITIVE MOTION, A LOT OF
MUSCLE MEMORY, THINGS LIKE THAT,
GOING ON WITH THIS.

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:52.723
Â¶

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:59.573
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS EXPROAS OWE.

00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:11.644
I WON THE WORLD BARISTA
CHAMPIONSHIP.
IT'S TOP HONORS OF ALL THE

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:15.882
PEOPLE COMPETING IN THIS TYPE OF
COMPETITION IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
SO FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:21.353
YOU'RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT
SOMETHING WAS ALMOST
UNFATHOMABLE, AND NOW IT'S

00:01:21.353 --> 00:01:27.994
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO THINK
TWICE ABOUT BEFORE I SAY, YEAH,
I DID.

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:33.432
IS THIS SOME OF THE TRICKS OF
THE TRADE TO TAKE AWAY THE WORLD
CUP?

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:39.571
AS FAR AS LATTE GOES, THIS IS
MAYBE NOT THE BEST LATTE THAT'S
EVER EXISTED.

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:46.212
I HAVE A 12-OUNCE DECAF CARMEL
LATTE.
WERE YOU TRAINING AS AN

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:50.883
ADOLESCENT FOR THIS?
NO, DEFINITELY I WAS NOT.
SO THEY DIDN'T SEND YOU TO

00:01:50.883 --> 00:01:53.752
COFFEE CAMP?
NO.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT NOW.

00:01:53.752 --> 00:02:02.295
WE HAVE BA -- BARISTA CAMP WHERE
PEOPLE CAN GO AND TAKE CLASSES.
NOT IN YOUR DAY?

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:08.767
YEARS AGO WORKING AT A PLACE
CALLED PT'S COFFEE ACTUALLY.
THAT COMPANY WAS REALLY, REALLY

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:13.272
FOCUSED ON THE QUALITY ASPECTS
OF COFFEE, THE DETAILS AND
MAKING EVERYTHING REALLY, REALLY

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:17.343
WELL.
I GOT A LOT OF FOUNDATIONAL
EDUCATION AND REALLY LEARNED A

00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:22.882
LOT ABOUT IT AND WAS REALLY VERY
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COFFEE.
AT ONE POINT, I THOUGHT I WAS

00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:25.651
GOING TO MOVE, AND I WAS LOOKING
FOR OPTIONS AND DIFFERENT
THINGS.

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:29.889
I JUST KIND OF ADVANCED MYSELF
IN SOME WAY.
THE OPPORTUNITY CAME IN HAWAII

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.893
TO GO TO HONOLULU AND WORK FOR A
COMPANY OUT THERE.
I GOT TO WORK WITH COFFEE FARMS

00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:41.200
OUT THERE, AND I GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO ROAST AND IMPROVE MY
SKILLS.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.240
IN 2011, I HAD GONE TO THE WORLD
COMPETITION, WHICH WAS IN
BOGOTA, AND THAT WAS A GREAT

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.843
OPPORTUNITY.
I GOT SECOND PLACE IN THAT
COMPETITION.

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:58.584
I FELT LIKE I HAD PIQUED IN MY
SKILLS AND WHATEVER ELSE.
BUT SOME OF IT I HAD BEEN

00:02:58.584 --> 00:03:03.022
SHOOTING FOR FOR A LONG TIME.
SO THIS YEAR WAS MY SEVENTH TIME
COMPETING, SEVENTH YEAR

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:07.393
COMPETING.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
LIKE I MADE A PRESENTATION THAT

00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:14.733
REALLY BROUGHT ALL OF THESE.
I WAS INTRODUCED TO A FARMER,
AND THEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT OUR

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:21.874
ROASTER AT PARISI COFFEE,
BECAUSE I GOT TO WORK SIDE BY
SIDE WITH HIM, LOOKING AT THE

00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:26.913
ROASTING PROFILES.
AND THEN I ALSO INTRODUCED KIND
OF MIFF SELL, CALLED MYSELF THE

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:31.483
VOICE OF THE COFFEE, BECAUSE I'M
THE INTERACTION POINT.
I TOOK ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS,

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:36.655
THESE THREE ELEMENTS OF COFFEE
PRODUCTION AND HOW IT'S MADE AND
KIND OF WRAPPED IT BACK AROUND

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:40.259
INTO THE SPEECH, BUT ALSO PLAYED
INTO THE DRINK.
THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:44.496
DRINK ALSO REPRESENTED WHAT EACH
OF THESE PEOPLE HAD DONE WITH
THE COFFEE AND WHAT THEY

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:48.567
REPRESENT AND HOW THEY AFFECT
IT.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:55.074
COMPETE AGAIN, WHICH IS A RELIEF
AND KIND OF A CONUNDRUM AT THE
SAME TIME.

00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:59.845
WHAT DO YOU DO, YOU KNOW?
YOU ARE RETIRING, RIGHT?
DID I SEE THAT?

00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:03.015
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE GOING OUT AT
THE TOP OF YOUR GAME, AS THEY
SAY.

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:07.553
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
DESCRIBING YOURSELF AS A
DIPLOMAT, IS THAT A STRETCH?

00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:11.790
I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU'RE GOING AND MEETING AND
YOU'RE REPRESENTING A LOT OF

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.595
OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, AROUND
THE WORLD, BUT ALSO SEEKING OUT
NEW RELATIONSHIPS AND BRINGING

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:20.566
PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A LOT OF
WAYS.
AND SO I THINK THAT COULD BE

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:26.772
DESCRIBED AS A DEPP --
DIPLOMATIC TYPE OF ROLE, A
MISSION.

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:30.309
WHICH PROBABLY MAKES YOUR
EMPLOYERS PRETTY HAPPY.
I ASSUME THEY THING THIS IS A

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:34.113
PRETTY COOL THING.
I'M SURE THEY ARE, YEAH.
THEY'VE BEEN VERY PROUD AND VERY

00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:42.654
SUPPORTIVE.
QUALITY ASSURANCE MANAGER.
IS THAT A REGULAR TITLE IN THE

00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:47.159
BEVERAGE WORLD?
I THINK SO, ESPECIALLY IN
COFFEE IT'S BECOMING A MUCH MORE

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.098
COMMON TITLE.
YOU KNOW, MOSTLY JUST BECAUSE
THE QUALITY ASPECT OF THE COFFEE

00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:56.068
IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT PART OF
WHAT THE COFFEE COMPANY DOES.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PERSON

00:04:56.068 --> 00:05:02.608
WHO IS IN THAT POSITION WHO IS
DOUBLE-CHECKING, MAKING SURE
EVERYTHING IS AS GOOD AS IT CAN

00:05:02.608 --> 00:05:09.615
BE OR SHOULD BE.
HOW ABOUT MAKING ME ONE OF
THOSE MACCHIATOS?

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:19.591
I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.
IT'S EXPRESSO, DOUBLE, A LITTLE
MILK.

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:25.664
RANDY'S FIRST MACCHIATO, GOOD
MOMENT.
YOUEL -- YOU ELEVATE YOURSELF

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:30.969
ON A WORLD STAGE, AND GLOBALLY
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING UP TO YOU
NOW, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT'S STILL

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.641
LARGELY ABOUT SERVING PEOPLE
GREAT COFFEE IN A CAFE.
IT'S JUST THE SIMPLE THINGS OF

00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:43.282
GIVING SOMEONE A DRINK AND
HAVING THEM SAY, LIKE, YEAH,
THIS IS REALLY NICE.

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:51.323
THERE YOU GO.
PETE HAS ALSO BEEN DEVELOPING
SOME OTHER INTERESTING

00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:58.230
BEVERAGES.
I GOT TO TELL YOU HIS LA VENDOR
VENDOR -- LAVENDER LEMONADE IS A

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.304
SURPRISINGLY TASTY SUMMER DRINK
TO CHASE THAT MACCHIATO.
WELL, WHATEVER YOU'RE

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:09.041
DRINKING, OUR TIME IS UP FOR
THIS EDITION OF THE LOCAL SHOW.
