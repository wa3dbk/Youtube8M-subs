 the car had a travel sales target 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.360
 This is what I could started working on the project as 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 long in advance 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.490
 the jobs to define a positioning 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 comes the concept of hipolito began a year before launch 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.790
 is to arrive at the concept that was finally working for the creation 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.230
 bring a car that 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.310
 was already a tremendous success in the work 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 Brazil was undoubtedly a huge challenge. 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 has made it has a number of technological innovations for example 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.610
 blue technology 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.470

 the on-board computer makes you connections by single voice command 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.850
 music is good that the biggest offense of the category is a car drawn is 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.240
 designed by china 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.140
 of the diary 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.960

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.400
 awarded in europe 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.519
 were developed 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.790
 Ansa is the more than 20 discussion groups we talk to over 200 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.660
 consumers 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.779
 are good people 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.059
 coming from a cultural academic background ' 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.229

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 4 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 this is 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.019
 I already consulted had the epicenter of praxe cia 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.839
 was to position this car

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.109
 of their decisions in this market the very rich and technologies are so 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.110
 fragmented media companies 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.509
 but at the same time 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.629
 is very worried 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.809
 the pieces of design and the questions 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.699
 technologies not embedded in a technology by technology but the 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.149

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.009
 for who is in the wheel working capital 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.569
 you do not control fools 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.769
 the consumer profile of staying because they are young people 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.679
 people aged 18 to 49 who escaped dengue 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.810
 can arouse interest then there is always one that is the creation of it 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.899
 the best of you 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 be in the campaign 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.380

 the driver and the passenger in life 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.679
 and that's where the signature came in you in charge 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.219
 Conceptually attribution car silver face 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.519
 How about the guy who runs his own life? 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.730
 translating this promotes the contest for agents and goal in the signature that you in the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.379
 command 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.809
 it's a car launch campaign that means that it has to have a lot 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.599
 car gift all the time 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.789
 you have to demonstrate all the differentials 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.609
 his techies all his puppies 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.220
 but at the same time 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.999
 you have to position it 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.419
 you have to say with the tone of voice that car will have 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.519
 How is he going to talk to people? 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.740
 and it's an honor it's a fine 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.370
 something like that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.650
 complicated in the world of 30 seconds 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.689
 and we were the attacker finds the bread of voice 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.820
 the concept 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.260
 it was complicated after usp the scripts nation is currently only you from ap a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.010
 side or the other, I'm going to talk to a woman, she will not talk to us, but soon 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.010
 talking to parents and we also had a goal to achieve 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.199
 inside the car the police 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.139
 it is goal is that few models get launch in this curious 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.960
 we will now see that the creation prepare the field and was holder with a teaser of 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.480
 15 seconds showing excerpts from the car saying that the press not only a 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.159
 success in europe 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.319
 this test was done with 15 seconds in the main transmitters opened in the teaser to 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.050
 people showed images of the car if it turns out that the car was confession in the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.629
 our tracks and beaches 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.659
 In the end, we asked the question 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.499
 question in truth 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.519

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.830
 to demonstrate your command 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.189
 This is a concept that all movies had 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.330
 each one has a different way and when it's time to launch the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.110

 the first crystal ball film 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.670
 we see a guy 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.240
 who recognizes a ball that is a girl 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.590

 we can not expect it to go after her life 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.020
 the disk is a site that deals with the search 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.230
