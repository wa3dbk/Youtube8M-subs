00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.929 
heavy
because<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.280> takes<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.579> little<00:03:05.699> bit<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
because I think it takes a little bit of

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.640 
because I think it takes a little bit of
practice<00:03:06.299> but<00:03:06.329> it's<00:03:06.599> easy<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:07.079> achieve<00:03:07.169> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
practice but it's easy to achieve and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.319 
practice but it's easy to achieve and
sponges<00:03:08.310> are<00:03:08.459> great<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:08.790> puffs<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.180> great

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
sponges are great and puffs are great

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.789

there's<00:04:07.469> this<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.919> myth<00:04:08.159> that<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.400> can't

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
there's this kind of myth that you can't

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.610 
there's this kind of myth that you can't
use<00:04:08.759> bright<00:04:09.000> colors<00:04:09.030> as<00:04:09.479> we<00:04:09.599> get<00:04:09.750> older<00:04:10.049> yes

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
use bright colors as we get older yes

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.399 
use bright colors as we get older yes
you<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:11.539> then<00:04:12.539> take<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> blending<00:04:13.139> brush<00:04:13.379> and

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
you can then take a blending brush and

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.069 
you can then take a blending brush and
blend<00:04:13.590> them<00:04:13.889> out<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:15.030> keep<00:04:15.299> blending<00:04:15.509> as<00:04:15.870> well

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
blend them out and keep blending as well

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.620 
blend them out and keep blending as well
here<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.620> not<00:04:17.340> too<00:04:17.579> harsh<00:04:17.849> because<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.389> we<00:04:18.509> get

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
here and not too harsh because as we get

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.779 
here and not too harsh because as we get
older<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.989> skin<00:04:19.289> becomes<00:04:19.590> slightly<00:04:19.889> less

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
older the skin becomes slightly less

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.110 
older the skin becomes slightly less
taut<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.419> we<00:04:21.479> need<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.719> be<00:04:21.810> slightly<00:04:22.139> more

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
taut so we need to be slightly more

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.770 
taut so we need to be slightly more
sympathetic

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
sympathetic

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.780 
sympathetic

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
lid and we're gonna blend this in with

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.160 
lid and we're gonna blend this in with
the<00:04:29.380> same<00:04:29.800> blending<00:04:30.160> brush<00:04:30.550> as<00:04:30.790> well<00:04:31.170> then

the same blending brush as well then

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.510 
the same blending brush as well then
we're<00:04:32.290> going<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.440> take<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.650> tiny<00:04:32.950> bit<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.430> just

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
we're going to take a tiny bit and just

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.100 
we're going to take a tiny bit and just
apply<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:33.970> underneath<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.600> eye<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:34.930> don't

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
apply that underneath the eye so don't

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.480 
apply that underneath the eye so don't
worry<00:04:35.200> if<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.380> looks<00:04:35.500> crazy<00:04:35.800> at<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.130> moment

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
worry if it looks crazy at the moment

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.990 
worry if it looks crazy at the moment
because<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.880> won't<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.330> once<00:04:37.900> we<00:04:38.080> finished<00:04:39.000> so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
because it won't do once we finished so
