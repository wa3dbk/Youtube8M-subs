she's just taking it with her nice try

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.190 
she's just taking it with her nice try
it<00:00:48.030> inside<00:00:48.330> to<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> camera<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> could

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it inside to get the camera so I could

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.889 
it inside to get the camera so I could
get<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> nest<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.660> above

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
get this so there's a nest right above

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
get this so there's a nest right above
my<00:00:58.050> head<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.340> there's<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.670> there

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
my head there there's one up there

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.450 
my head there there's one up there
already<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.340> she<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:02.910> babies

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
already so now I know she has two babies

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
already so now I know she has two babies
and<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.910> guess<00:01:06.090> she<00:01:06.390> decided<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.259> nest

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and I guess she decided that that nest

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.730 
and I guess she decided that that nest
is<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> better<00:01:07.979> place<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> box<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
is a better place than the box and I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120 
is a better place than the box and I
have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> feeling<00:01:11.190> why<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.740> wasn't<00:01:13.740> leaving<00:01:13.860> her

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
have a feeling why I wasn't leaving her

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
have a feeling why I wasn't leaving her
alone<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.759> put<00:01:15.539> a<00:01:15.570> bowl<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.289> food<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.770> there

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
alone I put a bowl of food up there

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.029 
alone I put a bowl of food up there
thinking<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.910> was<00:01:18.060> doing<00:01:18.210> her<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> favor<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.920> now

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
thinking I was doing her a favor but now

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.469 
thinking I was doing her a favor but now
I<00:01:20.070> realized<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.850> she<00:01:21.090> doesn't<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.330> her

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
I realized that she doesn't want her

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.149 
I realized that she doesn't want her
babies<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.810> their<00:01:21.990> food<00:01:22.759> because<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.090> food

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
babies in their food because the food

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
babies in their food because the food
not<00:01:26.159> only<00:01:26.430> does<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.610> draw<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:27.180> squirrels

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
not only does it draw other squirrels

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
not only does it draw other squirrels
which<00:01:28.470> would<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> problem<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:30.210> draws

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
which would be a problem but it draws

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.170 
which would be a problem but it draws
other<00:01:30.840> animals<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> made<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> mistake<00:01:32.759> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
other animals so I made a mistake I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
other animals so I made a mistake I
basically<00:01:33.720> kicked<00:01:34.079> her<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> nest<00:01:34.950> box

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
basically kicked her out of the nest box

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
basically kicked her out of the nest box
by<00:01:35.520> giving<00:01:36.450> her<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.780> food<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> learned

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
by giving her some food so I learned

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.310 
by giving her some food so I learned
something<00:01:41.479> she<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.570> another<00:01:42.840> baby<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.259> her

she's putting it back I don't believe it
I<00:03:11.500> guess<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.680> nests<00:03:13.010> weren't<00:03:13.250> good<00:03:13.430> enough

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
I guess the nests weren't good enough

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.470 
I guess the nests weren't good enough
okay<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:16.130> now<00:03:16.280> there's<00:03:16.550> one<00:03:16.670> baby<00:03:16.910> back<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.330> the
