00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 attention some images present 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.589
 in this program can hurt the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 sensitivity of the youngest 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.550
 if you are not 18, make sure you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.830
 to be alone during the viewing and not 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.650
 do not tell your parents 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.290
 the video games view in the line of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 sight of nadine morano a violence that 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.430
 raises more and more questions 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.880
 Scenic ryan and maxim come from 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.880
 to make a massacre and defense 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.070
 There is a lot of judging on the market 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.450
 but kind of really that's it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.920
 do not be afraid of us when they talk about it 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.970
 so how do we do to find the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 games they sell violent and who 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.000
 turns young gamer into asia it's 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.000
 yet simple 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 and since this is the first episode it is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.870
 of my duty to explain to you what 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 what is their caste in a few words 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 underlined by and funny music 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.290
 of unknown origin the crude that accepts 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.480
 or not the broadcast is all 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 just hate review the brutal 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.380
 and bloody from all ages and if 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 possible a little misunderstood you would be 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.260
 surprised how many super games 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.640
 have gone to the trap 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 simply because he was old or 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.470
 not well publicized in any case I will be 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 this gut in my task by genres 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 maybe if they come a day any 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 way I need no one I'll be 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.060
 by his side so by myself since 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060
 nobody want of my case 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 so I know what or where there for 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.640
 what a mouth me then I know what 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.260
 you're going to tell me but russian that's 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 not a game it's a mode 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.550
 what i will answer that tai chi 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 technique is uf or at home I 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.520
 answer that certainly it's not a game 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.140
 but what are we doing 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.420
 finally it's the best way to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 revisit a slaughter from another age is 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 what is strange is that I know 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.870
 in fact that few people who made the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.770
 first two doom 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.270
 it's true that now they can 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.940
 appear as current as claude 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.440
 dubois but it still remains 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.690
 the epicenter of all that is child 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 brutal blood of the demons of the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.810
 chainsaws of demons and blood 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.130

 gonadic and muscular it improves 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.310
 the graphics the sprites adds some 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.930
