00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.310
 good this one of this tutorial is going to be very 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.760
 cortito let's talk a little bit about the joint 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.740
 script open up like these objects 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.020
 and we knew in the previous tutorial that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.970
 we could pass if we are in mode 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.840
 addition to our object to create another 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.060
 they were already linked by mesh 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.190
 through the mesh and now what we want is 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.290
 in object mode as we join the objects 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.710
 so that they form the same mesh 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.430
 we have them in the tube moya wanted 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.160
 here the cursor shift 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.870
 and I create a sphere 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 to suppose that this sphere we are going to 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.980
 work and we will place on top of 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 kurt let's put in view from above 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.940
 all 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 5 so that it is orthogonal we give here az 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.239
 or clique masters 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.239
 with screencast 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.800
 if we stay here we can wireframe 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 man 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.960
 and we place it we put side view of 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.320
 side and we go up here the sphere 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.480
 we fix the cube we accept and we are 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 in solid sight and we are going to scale 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.070
 a little cube 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.220
 we work well we situate ourselves 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.110
 and do not wait and suppose we want these 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.730
 two elements together as we do 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.670
 we have a choice to the sphere we press if 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.380
 the right mouse and we also select 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.980
 cubed now what we have to do 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 is to go here to this tab a safe 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 control j that would be join or here in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.230
 tools click on chain 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.910
 and you see that they form and unite in a 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.930
 only element if we go to the online 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.930
 we will effectively have the cube 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.670
 which has been the last we have 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.009
 liquidated by logically from the first the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.060
 macular and which remains with the name 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 agree and now to separate it because 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 I had no problem with the previous 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.050
 tutorial 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.910
 if we want to separate both elements here 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.890
 we could apply any modifier 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 and I would work on both of them but now if 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.900
 we want to separate them we go to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.900
 rhythms of selected we select 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 to lists 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.300
 one of which he placed above pulse and him 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.100
 separated pressed the pe key and separate by 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.080
 selection by parts lost by 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.900
 materials by selection and now I have 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.360
 separated here we have our cube 001 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.840
 that really is the sole throws everything 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 Thank you
