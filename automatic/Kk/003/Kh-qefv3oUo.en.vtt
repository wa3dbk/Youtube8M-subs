you'll<00:01:13.660> describe<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.650> other<00:01:14.800> foot<00:01:15.070> back<00:01:15.310> flat

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
you'll describe the other foot back flat

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.820 
you'll describe the other foot back flat
on<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> ground<00:01:16.090> don't<00:01:16.900> lift<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.350> off<00:01:17.500> fifth

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
on the ground don't lift it off fifth

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.680 
on the ground don't lift it off fifth
annual<00:01:18.510> going<00:01:19.510> to<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.140> thing<00:01:20.610> which<00:01:21.610> is

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
annual going to that thing which is

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.450 
annual going to that thing which is
opposite<00:01:22.830> walking<00:01:23.830> back<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.360> don't<00:01:25.390> do<00:01:25.780> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
opposite walking back so don't do that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.740 
opposite walking back so don't do that
meaning<00:01:27.460> don't<00:01:27.640> lift<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.090> up<00:01:28.210> off<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.600> ground

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
meaning don't lift it up off the ground

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.580 
meaning don't lift it up off the ground
Cuba<00:01:29.260> flat<00:01:29.620> then<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.550> slip<00:01:31.200> by<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.260> other

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
Cuba flat then you slip by the other

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.320 
Cuba flat then you slip by the other
foot<00:01:32.890> back<00:01:33.100> such<00:01:33.990> 5x<00:01:35.400> check<00:01:36.400> round<00:01:36.760> if<00:01:37.210> you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
foot back such 5x check round if you

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.100 
foot back such 5x check round if you
want<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:38.190> go<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.369> with<00:01:39.460> your<00:01:39.640> balance<00:01:40.110> I'm

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
want to go in with your balance I'm

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
want to go in with your balance I'm
doing<00:01:41.410> this<00:01:41.530> carpet<00:01:42.340> not<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.300> best<00:01:43.450> surface

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
doing this carpet not the best surface

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
doing this carpet not the best surface
so<00:01:46.030> yeah<00:01:46.420> let's<00:01:46.720> get<00:01:46.900> those<00:01:47.050> step<00:01:47.440> two<00:01:47.619> down

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.050 

eventually<00:01:56.920> can<00:01:57.130> figure<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.610> out<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.850> little

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
eventually can figure that out a little

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.800 
eventually can figure that out a little
bit<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.500> then<00:01:59.910> eventually<00:02:01.260> just<00:02:02.260> have<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> nice

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
bit and then eventually just have a nice

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810 
bit and then eventually just have a nice
walk
