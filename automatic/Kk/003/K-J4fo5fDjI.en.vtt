when you're knitting a sock or in the
round<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.489> recommend<00:00:37.239> using<00:00:37.510> wool<00:00:38.020> well<00:00:38.620> it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
round I recommend using wool well it's

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.660 
round I recommend using wool well it's
amazing<00:00:40.000> how<00:00:40.630> many<00:00:40.690> things<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:42.250> worked<00:00:42.430> out

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
amazing how many things get worked out

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.970 
amazing how many things get worked out
when<00:00:43.149> you're<00:00:43.270> using<00:00:43.450> wool<00:00:43.840> if<00:00:44.680> you're<00:00:44.829> getting

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
when you're using wool if you're getting

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.520 
when you're using wool if you're getting
ladders<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:45.910> your<00:00:46.030> socks<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.690> you're<00:00:47.200> using<00:00:47.440> a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
ladders in your socks and you're using a

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.560 
ladders in your socks and you're using a
superwash<00:00:47.980> wool<00:00:48.010> yarn<00:00:48.520> as<00:00:48.850> soon<00:00:49.120> as<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.329> wash

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
superwash wool yarn as soon as you wash

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.180 
superwash wool yarn as soon as you wash
those<00:00:49.870> socks<00:00:50.170> most<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.770> problems

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
those socks most of the problems

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.810 
those socks most of the problems
disappear<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.480> I<00:00:53.440> guess<00:00:54.070> my<00:00:54.219> point<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.610> you're

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
disappear so I guess my point is you're

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.549 
disappear so I guess my point is you're
probably<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.300> better<00:00:55.360> knitter<00:00:55.930> than<00:00:56.200> you<00:00:56.320> think

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
probably a better knitter than you think

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.290 
probably a better knitter than you think
you<00:00:56.770> are<00:00:56.800> if<00:00:57.219> you're<00:00:57.460> trying<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.030> avoid

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
you are if you're trying to avoid

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.819 
you are if you're trying to avoid
getting<00:00:58.660> ladders<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.260> your<00:00:59.379> work<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.710> you're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
Magic Loop and we want it to be just

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.640 
Magic Loop and we want it to be just
smooth<00:01:39.520> nice<00:01:40.030> knitting<00:01:40.570> where<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.350> Magic

Loop ends or between the double pointed
needles<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.170> that's<00:01:44.650> what<00:01:44.770> we're<00:01:44.860> going

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
needles and so that's what we're going

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.450 
needles and so that's what we're going
to<00:01:45.009> talk<00:01:45.159> about<00:01:45.369> now<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:46.799> chose<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.950> demonstrate

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
to talk about now I chose to demonstrate

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.789 
to talk about now I chose to demonstrate
this<00:01:48.640> using<00:01:48.700> Magic<00:01:49.540> Loop<00:01:49.720> because<00:01:50.140> magic<00:01:50.500> loop

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
this using Magic Loop because magic loop

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.170 
this using Magic Loop because magic loop
is<00:01:50.920> where<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.220> can<00:01:51.369> have<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.820> biggest

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
is where you can have the biggest

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.929 
is where you can have the biggest
problem<00:01:52.659> because<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.920> stitch<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.700> last

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
problem because the stitch that you last

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
I mean I'm getting myself into position

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.429 
I mean I'm getting myself into position
to<00:01:59.950> work<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.400> first<00:02:00.700> stitch<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:02.200> is

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
to work this first stitch and this is

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.039 
to work this first stitch and this is
where<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.890> problem<00:02:03.250> happens<00:02:03.670> right<00:02:03.939> here<00:02:04.329> now

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
where the problem happens right here now

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.190 
where the problem happens right here now
if<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.649> pull<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.399> put<00:02:06.909> my<00:02:07.030> needle<00:02:07.299> in<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.810> I'm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
if I pull I put my needle in and I'm

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.199 
if I pull I put my needle in and I'm
thinking<00:02:08.679> oh<00:02:08.799> I<00:02:08.890> don't<00:02:09.310> want<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.670> ladder<00:02:09.879> I'm

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
thinking oh I don't want a ladder I'm

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.530 
thinking oh I don't want a ladder I'm
going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.479> pull<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.079> stitch<00:02:11.409> so<00:02:11.829> hard<00:02:12.610> okay

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
going to pull this stitch so hard okay

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.769 
going to pull this stitch so hard okay
what<00:02:14.379> we've<00:02:14.529> done<00:02:14.769> there<00:02:15.099> is<00:02:15.309> I've<00:02:16.299> pulled<00:02:16.629> the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:16.779 
what we've done there is I've pulled the

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.230 
what we've done there is I've pulled the
stitch<00:02:16.989> hard<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.590> I've<00:02:17.950> made<00:02:18.849> this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
stitch hard and I've made this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.020 
stitch hard and I've made this
last<00:02:19.390> ditch<00:02:19.720> way<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:21.010> too<00:02:21.070> tight<00:02:21.550> because

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
last ditch way way too tight because

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.670 
last ditch way way too tight because
there's<00:02:22.210> no<00:02:22.360> needle<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.050> on<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> cord

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
there's no needle there it's on the cord

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 
there's no needle there it's on the cord
and<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.310> cords<00:02:24.640> really<00:02:24.970> much<00:02:25.540> smaller<00:02:25.900> than

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and the cords really much smaller than

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.780 
and the cords really much smaller than
the<00:02:26.200> needle<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.890> when<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.100> pull<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.520> tight

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the needle so when I pull that tight

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.720 
the needle so when I pull that tight
I've<00:02:28.090> made<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.570> stitch<00:02:28.840> tiny<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:30.460> pull

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
I've made that stitch tiny and I pull

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.430 
I've made that stitch tiny and I pull
the<00:02:30.850> stitch<00:02:31.060> through<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.720> finish<00:02:32.050> up<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.350> go

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
the stitch through and finish up and go

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.980 
the stitch through and finish up and go
on<00:02:32.470> knitting<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.420> you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
on knitting and you and it's just you

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.800 
on knitting and you and it's just you
know<00:02:35.580> intuitive<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.730> think<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.210> pulling<00:02:37.570> it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
know intuitive to think that pulling it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.150 
know intuitive to think that pulling it
tightly<00:02:38.080> would<00:02:38.380> make<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.680> avoid<00:02:38.980> these

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
tightly would make you avoid these

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.700 
tightly would make you avoid these
ladders<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:40.180> both<00:02:40.510> leaving<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.230> too<00:02:41.440> tight

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
ladders but both leaving it too tight

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.460 
ladders but both leaving it too tight
and<00:02:41.970> leaving<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.060> too<00:02:43.240> loose<00:02:43.450> will<00:02:43.990> create<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
and leaving it too loose will create the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.960 
and leaving it too loose will create the
latter<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:47.040> your<00:02:48.040> instinct<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.760> pull

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
latter so if your instinct is to pull

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.790 
latter so if your instinct is to pull
really<00:02:49.180> tight

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
really tight

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.620 
really tight
loosen<00:02:50.800> up<00:02:50.920> make<00:02:51.760> sure<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.210> when<00:02:52.420> you're

doing magic loop that when you put the

I'm<00:02:57.940> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.150> loosen<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.690> back<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.080> way

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
I'm going to loosen this up back the way

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.230 
I'm going to loosen this up back the way
it<00:02:59.290> should<00:02:59.320> be<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.860> you're<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.640> using<00:03:01.000> good

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
it should be that you're just using good

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.200 
it should be that you're just using good
tension<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:02.050> crazy<00:03:02.440> tight<00:03:02.770> tension<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.490> want

tension not crazy tight tension I want

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.960 
tension not crazy tight tension I want
to<00:03:04.480> keep<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.590> stitch<00:03:05.830> loose<00:03:06.100> enough<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.610> if

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
to keep this stitch loose enough as if

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.940 
to keep this stitch loose enough as if
there<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.330> still<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> needle<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.440> there<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
there was still a needle in there and it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.550 
there was still a needle in there and it
wasn't<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.460> cord<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.660> gentle<00:03:11.170> nice

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
wasn't on the cord so just gentle nice

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.530 
wasn't on the cord so just gentle nice
tension<00:03:11.920> would<00:03:12.430> fix<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.880> up<00:03:13.060> with<00:03:13.180> pulling

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
tension would fix that up with pulling

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.720 
tension would fix that up with pulling
too<00:03:13.690> tight<00:03:13.960> now<00:03:14.770> if<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.160> are<00:03:15.340> having<00:03:15.580> a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
problem and this is more common with

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170 
problem and this is more common with
with<00:03:17.560> double<00:03:17.860> pointed<00:03:17.980> needles<00:03:18.460> where<00:03:18.940> things

are flopping around and you are leaving

are flopping around and you are leaving
it<00:03:21.430> too<00:03:21.640> loose

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
it too loose

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.340 
it too loose
you'd<00:03:23.830> want<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.160> make<00:03:24.400> sure<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:25.210> when<00:03:26.200> you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
you'd want to make sure that when you

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.020 
you'd want to make sure that when you
are<00:03:26.380> ready<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.040> pull<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> stitch<00:03:27.640> through

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
are ready to pull that stitch through

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.420 
are ready to pull that stitch through
that<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.810> two<00:03:29.020> stitches<00:03:29.290> are<00:03:29.650> very<00:03:29.950> close<00:03:30.220> to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that the two stitches are very close to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.240 
that the two stitches are very close to
each<00:03:30.460> other<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.720> are<00:03:31.870> leaving<00:03:32.250> this

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
each other if you are leaving this

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.190 
each other if you are leaving this
stitch<00:03:33.490> way<00:03:33.700> over<00:03:33.940> here<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.420> wrapping<00:03:35.080> this

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
stitch way over here and wrapping this

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.080 
stitch way over here and wrapping this
stitch<00:03:35.440> over<00:03:35.710> here<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.460> can<00:03:36.640> see<00:03:36.790> that's<00:03:36.940> an

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
stitch over here you can see that's an

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.700 
stitch over here you can see that's an
obvious<00:03:37.330> way<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.750> get<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.020> ladder<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.500> when

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
obvious way to get a ladder is when

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.290 
obvious way to get a ladder is when
there's<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.070> huge<00:03:39.340> distance<00:03:39.790> between<00:03:39.970> this

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
there's a huge distance between this

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.750 
there's a huge distance between this
stitch<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.050> stitch<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.490> pull<00:03:42.730> it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
stitch and this stitch so if you pull it

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.910 
stitch and this stitch so if you pull it
up<00:03:42.940> tightly<00:03:43.420> enough<00:03:44.020> so<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.710> two

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
up tightly enough so that the two

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.820 
up tightly enough so that the two
stitches<00:03:45.280> are<00:03:45.370> close<00:03:45.550> together<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:47.530> pull<00:03:47.710> it

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
stitches are close together you pull it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.440 
stitches are close together you pull it
through<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.370> will<00:03:48.520> help<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.820> avoid<00:03:49.060> ladders

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
through that will help you avoid ladders

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.840 
through that will help you avoid ladders
as<00:03:49.600> well<00:03:53.190> okay<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.250> we've<00:03:54.460> covered<00:03:54.490> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
as well okay so we've covered the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.610 
as well okay so we've covered the
techniques<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.510> how<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.720> avoid<00:03:56.050> ladders<00:03:56.470> but

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
techniques and how to avoid ladders but

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.650 
techniques and how to avoid ladders but
I<00:03:56.680> guess<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.250> something<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.210> really<00:03:58.510> want

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
I guess the something that I really want

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.090 
I guess the something that I really want
you<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.780> understand<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.740> you're

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
you to understand is if you're

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.740 
you to understand is if you're
experiencing<00:04:00.760> ladders<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.300> your<00:04:01.480> first

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
experiencing ladders and your first

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.200 
experiencing ladders and your first
instinct<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:02.710> pull<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.430> stitch<00:04:03.880> so

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
instinct is to just pull that stitch so

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.390 
instinct is to just pull that stitch so
tightly<00:04:04.570> between<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.200> needles<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.950> probably

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
tightly between the needles you probably

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.310 
tightly between the needles you probably
need<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.640> loosen<00:04:06.910> up<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.330> avoid<00:04:07.570> ladders<00:04:07.960> if

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
need to loosen up to avoid ladders if

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.070 
need to loosen up to avoid ladders if
your<00:04:09.250> instinct<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.330> work<00:04:10.510> loosely

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
your instinct is just to work loosely

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.650 
your instinct is just to work loosely
with<00:04:11.440> with<00:04:11.830> even<00:04:12.280> loose<00:04:12.640> tension<00:04:13.240> you

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
with with even loose tension you

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.960 
with with even loose tension you
probably<00:04:14.110> need<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.410> tighten<00:04:14.680> up<00:04:14.950> ladders<00:04:15.730> can

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
probably need to tighten up ladders can

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.360 
probably need to tighten up ladders can
happen<00:04:16.510> either<00:04:16.930> with<00:04:17.260> too<00:04:17.560> much<00:04:17.739> tension<00:04:18.220> or

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
happen either with too much tension or

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.360 
happen either with too much tension or
not<00:04:18.609> enough<00:04:19.060> tension<00:04:19.270> so<00:04:20.190> really<00:04:21.190> just

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
not enough tension so really just

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.800 
not enough tension so really just
practicing<00:04:21.790> good<00:04:21.970> tension<00:04:22.330> all<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.480> time

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
practicing good tension all the time

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.070 
practicing good tension all the time
will<00:04:23.470> help<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.980> avoid<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> ladders<00:04:24.670> but<00:04:25.080> try
