have<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.330> character<00:05:09.660> spawn<00:05:09.900> in<00:05:10.050> each<00:05:10.169> other

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
have the character spawn in each other

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.080 
have the character spawn in each other
and<00:05:10.470> look<00:05:10.620> all<00:05:10.740> stupid<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.699> animations

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
and look all stupid and the animations

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.240 
and look all stupid and the animations
can<00:05:12.180> mess<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.449> but<00:05:12.720> when<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.260> let<00:05:13.650> people<00:05:14.100> play

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
can mess it but when you let people play

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.850 
can mess it but when you let people play
their<00:05:14.490> game<00:05:14.699> together<00:05:15.330> it's<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.110> lot<00:05:16.350> more<00:05:16.380> fun

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
their game together it's a lot more fun

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.050 
their game together it's a lot more fun
especially<00:05:17.460> if<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.300> just<00:05:18.510> works<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:20.250> works

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
especially if it just works and I works

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.710 
especially if it just works and I works
with<00:05:21.630> co-op<00:05:21.870> just<00:05:22.830> like<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.370> with<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.389> having

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
with co-op just like that with I having

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.170 
with co-op just like that with I having
co-op<00:05:25.099> could<00:05:26.099> feel<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> little<00:05:26.580> bit<00:05:26.760> easy<00:05:27.000> at

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
co-op could feel a little bit easy at

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.029 
co-op could feel a little bit easy at
times<00:05:27.210> but<00:05:27.660> generally<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.410> kind<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.889> hard

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
times but generally it's kind of a hard

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.450 
times but generally it's kind of a hard
game<00:05:29.220> like<00:05:29.550> when<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.180> first<00:05:30.690> played<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.770> really

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
game like when I first played I really

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.339 
game like when I first played I really
didn't<00:05:32.760> know<00:05:32.789> what<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.300> do<00:05:33.450> at<00:05:33.479> all<00:05:33.780> alike<00:05:34.110> cuz

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
didn't know what to do at all alike cuz

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.190 
didn't know what to do at all alike cuz
I'm<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.650> big<00:05:34.889> RPG<00:05:35.370> fan<00:05:35.610> but<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.360> was<00:05:36.900> just<00:05:36.930> trying

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
I'm a big RPG fan but I was just trying

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.690 
I'm a big RPG fan but I was just trying
to<00:05:37.260> wandering<00:05:37.740> around<00:05:37.889> and<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.370> didn't<00:05:38.580> really

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
to wandering around and I didn't really

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.310 
to wandering around and I didn't really
get<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:38.940> cause<00:05:39.150> like<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.870> don't<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.169> her

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
get it cause like you don't have her

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.020 
get it cause like you don't have her
generating<00:05:40.770> health<00:05:40.919> which<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.430> like<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:41.940> when

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
generating health which I like it when

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.430 
generating health which I like it when
games<00:05:42.210> don't<00:05:42.450> give<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> regenerating

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
games don't give you the regenerating

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.190 
games don't give you the regenerating
health<00:05:43.470> crap<00:05:43.860> but<00:05:44.460> there<00:05:45.389> was<00:05:45.539> like<00:05:45.720> no<00:05:45.960> way<00:05:46.139> to

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
health crap but there was like no way to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.440 
health crap but there was like no way to
heal<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:46.740> didn't<00:05:47.010> understand<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:47.789> I

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
heal and I didn't understand it and I

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.730 
heal and I didn't understand it and I
started<00:05:48.810> realizing<00:05:48.990> every<00:05:49.349> single<00:05:49.590> time<00:05:49.710> I

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
started realizing every single time I

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.460 
started realizing every single time I
killed<00:05:49.979> an<00:05:50.039> enemy<00:05:50.130> i<00:05:50.340> got<00:05:50.669> bros<00:05:51.570> hosts<00:05:52.020> like

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
killed an enemy i got bros hosts like

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.760 
killed an enemy i got bros hosts like
bro<00:05:52.860> dollars<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:54.139> that<00:05:55.139> pretty<00:05:55.680> much

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
bro dollars and that pretty much

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.010 
bro dollars and that pretty much
accumulated<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.580> bunch<00:05:56.789> of<00:05:56.940> money<00:05:57.150> so<00:05:57.870> then

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
accumulated to a bunch of money so then

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.439 
accumulated to a bunch of money so then
I<00:05:58.080> realized<00:05:58.470> oh<00:05:58.770> I've<00:05:59.160> got<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> purchase<00:06:00.240> than

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.890 
but the way they split it up isn't just
to<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.580> bunch<00:06:39.790> of<00:06:39.910> different<00:06:40.180> smaller<00:06:40.480> worlds

to a bunch of different smaller worlds
where<00:06:41.140> it's<00:06:41.170> kind<00:06:41.440> of<00:06:41.530> pretty<00:06:42.010> open<00:06:42.490> in<00:06:42.670> those

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
where it's kind of pretty open in those

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.280 
where it's kind of pretty open in those
environments<00:06:43.270> so<00:06:43.660> it's<00:06:43.780> big<00:06:43.990> open

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
environments so it's big open

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.600 
environments so it's big open
environments<00:06:44.770> but<00:06:44.860> you<00:06:44.980> switch<00:06:45.160> routine<00:06:45.430> them

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
environments but you switch routine them

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.010 
environments but you switch routine them
kind<00:06:46.060> of<00:06:46.150> like<00:06:46.300> how<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.510> original<00:06:46.900> half-life

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
kind of like how the original half-life

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.630 
kind of like how the original half-life
was<00:06:47.320> like<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:47.620> was<00:06:47.770> one<00:06:47.980> solid<00:06:48.250> fluid

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
was like it was one solid fluid

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.980 
was like it was one solid fluid
experience<00:06:48.910> going<00:06:49.240> all<00:06:49.450> the<00:06:49.510> way<00:06:49.600> through<00:06:49.840> but

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
experience going all the way through but

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.240 
experience going all the way through but
you<00:06:50.020> had<00:06:50.200> to<00:06:50.230> live<00:06:50.440> in<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.650> different<00:06:50.980> levels

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
you had to live in the different levels

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.970 
you had to live in the different levels
and<00:06:51.370> it's<00:06:51.520> like<00:06:51.670> the<00:06:52.300> big<00:06:52.540> main<00:06:53.290> world<00:06:53.590> there's

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
and it's like the big main world there's

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.590 
and it's like the big main world there's
a<00:06:54.040> big<00:06:54.130> hub<00:06:54.340> world<00:06:54.610> that<00:06:54.790> you<00:06:54.850> can<00:06:55.000> go<00:06:55.120> into<00:06:55.420> and

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
a big hub world that you can go into and

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.460 
a big hub world that you can go into and
then<00:06:55.690> you<00:06:55.750> can<00:06:55.900> switch<00:06:56.020> between<00:06:56.200> these

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
then you can switch between these

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.750 
then you can switch between these
missions<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:56.920> after<00:06:57.100> you<00:06:57.160> complete<00:06:57.460> one<00:06:57.580> you

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
missions and after you complete one you

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.850 
missions and after you complete one you
unlock<00:06:58.150> it<00:06:58.330> to<00:06:58.420> play<00:06:58.600> it<00:06:58.720> with<00:06:58.840> just<00:06:58.960> like<00:06:59.170> like

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
unlock it to play it with just like like

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500 
unlock it to play it with just like like
again<00:07:00.160> just<00:07:00.400> for<00:07:00.430> fun<00:07:00.790> and<00:07:01.060> with<00:07:01.240> like<00:07:01.420> all

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
again just for fun and with like all

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.880 
again just for fun and with like all
these<00:07:01.630> randomly<00:07:02.020> generated<00:07:02.470> missions<00:07:02.740> and

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
these randomly generated missions and

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.470 
these randomly generated missions and
that's<00:07:03.010> why<00:07:03.190> it's<00:07:03.580> got<00:07:03.730> amazing<00:07:03.940> replay<00:07:04.360> by

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
that's why it's got amazing replay by

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.000 
that's why it's got amazing replay by
like<00:07:04.600> you<00:07:04.690> can<00:07:04.900> just<00:07:04.930> you<00:07:05.530> can<00:07:05.590> do<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.890> same

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
like you can just you can do the same

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.200 
like you can just you can do the same
environments<00:07:06.490> over<00:07:06.610> and<00:07:06.730> over<00:07:06.790> but<00:07:07.000> it'll

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
environments over and over but it'll

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.520 
environments over and over but it'll
always<00:07:07.360> be<00:07:07.480> these<00:07:07.690> different<00:07:08.050> missions<00:07:08.350> but

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
always be these different missions but

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.680 
always be these different missions but
it<00:07:08.650> won't<00:07:08.830> be<00:07:08.890> the<00:07:09.040> story<00:07:09.340> missions<00:07:09.910> over<00:07:10.450> and

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
it won't be the story missions over and

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.530 
it won't be the story missions over and
over<00:07:10.810> the<00:07:10.990> same<00:07:11.020> time<00:07:11.140> so<00:07:11.770> I<00:07:12.030> personally<00:07:13.030> had<00:07:13.510> a

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540 
over the same time so I personally had a

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.570 
over the same time so I personally had a
blast<00:07:13.900> playing<00:07:14.200> I<00:07:14.530> after<00:07:15.070> I<00:07:15.100> knew<00:07:15.280> what<00:07:15.400> I<00:07:15.460> was

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
blast playing I after I knew what I was

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.810 
blast playing I after I knew what I was
doing<00:07:15.640> it<00:07:16.630> looks<00:07:16.930> good<00:07:17.230> it<00:07:17.500> sounds<00:07:17.830> good<00:07:18.310> it's

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
doing it looks good it sounds good it's

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.640 
doing it looks good it sounds good it's
interesting<00:07:19.300> it<00:07:19.810> doesn't<00:07:20.020> have<00:07:20.110> some<00:07:20.290> boring

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
interesting it doesn't have some boring

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.000 
interesting it doesn't have some boring
story<00:07:21.010> so<00:07:21.540> honestly<00:07:22.540> it's<00:07:22.750> a<00:07:22.960> good<00:07:23.350> game<00:07:23.530> it's

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
story so honestly it's a good game it's

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.800 
story so honestly it's a good game it's
just<00:07:24.310> it's<00:07:24.820> got<00:07:25.060> that<00:07:25.240> big<00:07:25.420> learning<00:07:25.780> curve

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
just it's got that big learning curve

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.510 
just it's got that big learning curve
that<00:07:26.200> some<00:07:26.530> people<00:07:26.770> might<00:07:26.920> not<00:07:27.070> be<00:07:27.190> able<00:07:27.280> to

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
that some people might not be able to

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.600 
that some people might not be able to
leap<00:07:28.270> over<00:07:28.450> that<00:07:28.720> bump<00:07:28.930> and<00:07:29.110> just<00:07:29.620> keep<00:07:30.430> on

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
leap over that bump and just keep on

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.630 
leap over that bump and just keep on
playing<00:07:30.880> I'm<00:07:31.660> giving<00:07:32.080> I<00:07:32.260> divine<00:07:32.830> cybermancy<00:07:33.070> a

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640 
playing I'm giving I divine cybermancy a

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.880 
playing I'm giving I divine cybermancy a
4<00:07:33.970> out<00:07:34.060> of<00:07:34.150> 5<00:07:34.360> am<00:07:34.870> I<00:07:34.960> reasoning<00:07:35.440> behind<00:07:35.560> this

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:35.890 
4 out of 5 am I reasoning behind this

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.060 
4 out of 5 am I reasoning behind this
being<00:07:36.310> that<00:07:36.430> I<00:07:36.910> was<00:07:37.240> wanting<00:07:38.200> to<00:07:38.560> give<00:07:38.710> it<00:07:38.800> a<00:07:38.890> 5

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.070 
being that I was wanting to give it a 5

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.860 
being that I was wanting to give it a 5
out<00:07:39.100> of<00:07:39.280> 5<00:07:39.340> but<00:07:39.940> I<00:07:40.090> felt<00:07:40.330> that<00:07:40.390> there<00:07:40.600> was<00:07:40.630> just

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870 
out of 5 but I felt that there was just

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.659 
out of 5 but I felt that there was just
too<00:07:41.020> generous<00:07:41.410> in<00:07:41.740> because<00:07:42.190> of<00:07:42.220> all<00:07:42.550> the

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669 
too generous in because of all the

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.000 
too generous in because of all the
little<00:07:42.820> setbacks<00:07:43.510> that<00:07:43.690> I<00:07:43.750> had<00:07:43.900> doing<00:07:44.050> while<00:07:44.980> I

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
little setbacks that I had doing while I

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.710 
little setbacks that I had doing while I
was<00:07:45.100> playing<00:07:45.460> like<00:07:45.730> figuring<00:07:46.300> out<00:07:46.450> what<00:07:46.600> the

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
was playing like figuring out what the

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.540 
was playing like figuring out what the
hell<00:07:46.840> to<00:07:46.870> do<00:07:47.050> for<00:07:47.200> the<00:07:47.290> first<00:07:47.470> hour<00:07:47.680> or<00:07:47.830> just

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
hell to do for the first hour or just

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.700 
hell to do for the first hour or just
all<00:07:49.090> the<00:07:49.330> little<00:07:49.510> small<00:07:49.690> glitches<00:07:50.050> that<00:07:50.260> end

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710 
all the little small glitches that end

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.250 
all the little small glitches that end
up<00:07:50.890> kind<00:07:51.340> of<00:07:51.490> not<00:07:52.060> necessarily<00:07:52.480> ruining<00:07:52.900> it<00:07:53.050> I

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.260 
up kind of not necessarily ruining it I

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.620 
up kind of not necessarily ruining it I
don't<00:07:53.800> think<00:07:54.040> glitches<00:07:54.730> in<00:07:54.910> any<00:07:55.060> way<00:07:55.210> ruin<00:07:55.570> a

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.630 
don't think glitches in any way ruin a

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.630 
don't think glitches in any way ruin a
game<00:07:55.840> I<00:07:56.100> undefined<00:07:57.100> which<00:07:57.220> is<00:07:57.370> kind<00:07:57.550> of<00:07:57.580> funny

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640 
game I undefined which is kind of funny

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.940 
game I undefined which is kind of funny
when<00:07:57.910> they<00:07:58.030> happen<00:07:58.330> but<00:07:58.570> I<00:07:58.810> just<00:07:59.500> don't<00:07:59.800> think

00:07:59.940 --> 00:07:59.950 
when they happen but I just don't think

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.320 
when they happen but I just don't think
I<00:08:00.340> is<00:08:00.880> at<00:08:01.270> that<00:08:01.630> super<00:08:02.590> polished<00:08:03.340> level<00:08:03.790> of<00:08:04.030> the

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330 
I is at that super polished level of the

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.690 
I is at that super polished level of the
game<00:08:04.510> it's<00:08:04.840> just<00:08:05.050> a<00:08:05.230> really<00:08:05.860> good<00:08:05.980> game<00:08:06.370> and<00:08:06.610> if

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.700 
game it's just a really good game and if

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.750 
game it's just a really good game and if
it<00:08:07.600> would<00:08:07.720> ever<00:08:07.750> go<00:08:08.080> on<00:08:08.110> sale<00:08:08.500> I<00:08:08.830> wouldn't<00:08:09.610> even

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:09.760 
it would ever go on sale I wouldn't even

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.560 
it would ever go on sale I wouldn't even
think<00:08:10.180> twice<00:08:10.510> about<00:08:10.630> picking<00:08:11.320> it<00:08:11.440> up
