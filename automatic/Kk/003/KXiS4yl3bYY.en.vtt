00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
tile is installed you can see exactly

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
tile is installed you can see exactly
how<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.970> gap<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.810> then

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
how big of a gap there is and then

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
how big of a gap there is and then
estimate<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.680> many<00:01:16.740> spacers<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.610> need

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
estimate how many spacers you will need

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.090 
estimate how many spacers you will need
and<00:01:18.540> compress<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> stack<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.680> spacers

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and compress the stack of spacers

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
and compress the stack of spacers
together<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> test<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.600> sure<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
together and test it to make sure it is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
together and test it to make sure it is
the<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.710> thickness<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.360> add<00:01:24.630> spacers

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the right thickness you can add spacers

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
the right thickness you can add spacers
or<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.500> them<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.189> make<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.580> switch<00:01:26.880> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
or take them off to make the switch or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.899
