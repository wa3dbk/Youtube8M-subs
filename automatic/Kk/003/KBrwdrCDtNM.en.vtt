00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.670
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.340
 over a lot 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.620
 the modern 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.200
 let's talk about the major blues 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.580
 has a typical harmonic based structure 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.060
 on twelve measures 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.590
 let's see how this is made up 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.990
 harmonic structure and what are the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.509
 agreements that make up the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.860
 blues structure in this figure that 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.259
 see the structure on my left 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.000
 of the blues is represented in the form of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.059
 Roman numbers 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.430
 if in fact the agreement of the first is alone 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.050
 now all the others are not rowing 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.540
 blues chords starting from the note 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.120
 soul that just the tone of ours 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.429
 blues in the figure on the left indeed yes 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.039
 can see how the blues starts with the 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.300
 first instance in fact seventh all 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.579
 blues chords are wary of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.710
 dominant is in this structure that you 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.210
 I propose that it is very simple but it is also 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.850
 the most used one the most 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.829
 traditional and there are three agreements 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.690
 that are in this respect relationship 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.960
 to the main agreement first degree in 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.390
 first degree disagreement fourth degree 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.900
 and fifth grade while you realize that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.220
 they constitute the structure of the plus 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.110
 let's see how ours is divided 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.530
 structure then we have first measure 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.120
 the first degree seventh second measure 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.320
 fourth grade seventh optional in 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.180
 different blues structures 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.440
 this change does not take place is the second 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.300
 measure 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.520
 and still the first degree that remains still 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.370
 therefore still dense measure and fourth 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.660
 first degree sediment still needs 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.640
 at this point let's head to and 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.800
 consider the second line of the blues 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.910
 in this case we have the passage to 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.370
 fourth degree that remains firm in this 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.500
 structure for two measures and therefore 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.110
 we have return 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.060
 I remain at this point we have 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.479
 again I change to the third nico 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.140
 we have the fifth grade seventh in 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.420
 this case he felt dossetti but that is 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.430
 an optional change but a lot 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 therefore used in some structures the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.209
 fifth grade was 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.250
 so we said bar 10 fourth 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.920
 optional first degree degree are 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.769
 measure 11 and finally measure 12 fifth 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.180
 able to finish the structure 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.129
 so let's go see it as I was 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.750
 played the structure of the blues in the tone 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.610
 of g 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.610
 that is soul so we have soul 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.090
 and here ends the so-called bonus ie 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.600
 this structure in twelve measures e 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.630
 let 's say the minimal structure that yes 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.910
 repeats a number xd times during the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.460
 therefore generally a theme song but also 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.890
 all solos last a multiple of 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.290
 this structure that comes therefore always 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 repeated in a similar way at least in 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.480
 blues the most traditional 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.040
 let's see some more solutions 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 articulated to accompany the blues ve 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.120
 there are many in this case vi 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.840
 I suggest a solution that to do 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.150
 with the power chords and that is with the use 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.800
 of a power chords of the various agreements of the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.470
 our use in this case is a movement 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.590
 melodic that is done starting from 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.210
 power kong and playing the sixth 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.870
 of the agreement to the thirteenth se 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.870
 we want to say 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.150
 that is, once the power is taken 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.620
 chords the little finger goes to press the note 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.240
 which is a tone above respect 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.940
 ahronot pressed hit number 3 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.250
 this movement can be used 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:02.960
 to melodically enrich the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:04.780
 static if we add a little to this 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.330
 of palms new thing we get an effect 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.410
 typically blues rock blues to this 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.360
 movement 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.770
 since it is based on power chords 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.480
 which remains the same also on which 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.290
 on alcohol based on the rope tip lo 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.760
 we can also transpose into others 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.100
 points here 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.600
 then we play in a blues string 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.870
 the first four measures of ours 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:38.350
 structure will sound so fourth degree 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.350
 and return is repeated 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.960
 at this point we then move on to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.480
 fifth measure we have the change on 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:56.310
 fourth grade who remains stationary and return 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:58.710
 up first at this point we have the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.410
 bar number 9 where we have the fifth 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:09.230
 blues degree 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:09.230
 let's make the transition to the fourth and fifth 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.610
 therefore wanting to resonate the whole 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.930
 structure a little faster 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.930
 we get this 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.210
 ok for this lesson everything in the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.730
 next lesson we will deal with 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.380
 to study the major seven chords in 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.670
 open position 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.050
 thank you for watching this 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.740
 video and I give you an appointment the next time 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.130
 lesson 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.130
 Hello
