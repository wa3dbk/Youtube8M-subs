vein as chrono knots and we'll get into

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.509 
vein as chrono knots and we'll get into
some<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> basic<00:00:28.590> gameplay<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> first

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
some of the basic gameplay but the first

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
some of the basic gameplay but the first
thing<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.849> wanted<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> show<00:00:30.240> everyone<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.929> the

thing I wanted to show everyone was the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410 
thing I wanted to show everyone was the
actual<00:00:31.579> cards<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> components<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.239> come

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
actual cards and components that come

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
actual cards and components that come
with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> game<00:00:33.870> itself<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.890> let's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
with the game itself so with that let's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
with the game itself so with that let's
open<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> box<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.870> comes

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
open up the box and see what comes

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.840 
open up the box and see what comes
inside<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.760> going

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
inside so the first thing you're going

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
inside so the first thing you're going
to<00:00:41.910> notice<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> size<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> box<00:00:43.620> itself

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to notice is the size of the box itself

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
to notice is the size of the box itself
in<00:00:44.309> typical<00:00:44.820> Looney<00:00:45.329> labs<00:00:45.570> fashion<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
in typical Looney labs fashion it is

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.930 
in typical Looney labs fashion it is
very<00:00:47.190> small<00:00:47.809> box<00:00:48.890> very<00:00:49.890> similar<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> chrono

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
very small box very similar to chrono

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229 
very small box very similar to chrono
knots<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.110> flux<00:00:52.350> line<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> games<00:00:53.239> inside

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
knots and the flux line of games inside

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
knots and the flux line of games inside
there<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:55.140> insert<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.949> divides<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
there is an insert that divides the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
there is an insert that divides the
cards<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:56.969> half<00:00:57.180> there's<00:00:57.600> 100<00:00:58.140> cards<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
cards in half there's 100 cards that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
cards in half there's 100 cards that
ship<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> game<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.809> consist<00:01:01.170> of

ship of the game and they consist of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.020 
ship of the game and they consist of
three<00:01:01.590> different<00:01:01.739> types<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.399> cards<00:01:02.699> really

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
three different types of cards really

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
three different types of cards really
there's<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> ID<00:01:03.870> cards<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:05.100> represent

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there's the ID cards which represent

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.390 
there's the ID cards which represent
each<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> players<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.070> looking<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.189> these

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
each of the players and looking at these

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
each of the players and looking at these
they're<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.090> made<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.600> names<00:01:09.840> their

actually hang as a clock instead and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.449 
actually hang as a clock instead and
that<00:04:15.780> would<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.349> game<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.159> you're<00:04:17.370> the

that would in the game so you're the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.460 
that would in the game so you're the
objective<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:18.959> through<00:04:19.139> time

objective is for you to go through time

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.850 
objective is for you to go through time
get<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.489> exact<00:04:20.940> timeline<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.409> need<00:04:22.650> on

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
get the exact timeline that you need on

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.740 
get the exact timeline that you need on
your<00:04:22.889> card<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:23.760> have<00:04:24.060> dog<00:04:24.690> brown<00:04:25.020> not

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.360 
your card and then have dog brown not
invent<00:04:25.990> time<00:04:26.200> travel<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.920> you're<00:04:27.100> stuck

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370

they had used license pictures from the
game<00:04:57.070> i<00:04:57.220> thought<00:04:57.400> what<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.760> brought<00:04:57.910> more<00:04:58.210> into

the<00:04:58.600> game<00:04:58.780> but<00:04:58.810> since<00:04:59.680> there<00:04:59.890> are<00:05:00.010> some

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
the game but since there are some

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.700 
the game but since there are some
made-up<00:05:00.790> fictional<00:05:01.570> areas<00:05:02.020> within<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.560> back

to the universe universe so to speak

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.110 
to the universe universe so to speak
they<00:05:05.710> had<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:05.980> take<00:05:06.130> some<00:05:06.190> liberties<00:05:06.550> and

discarding things power actions are just

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.250 
discarding things power actions are just
as<00:05:46.000> powerful<00:05:46.180> because<00:05:46.570> some<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.780> them<00:05:46.960> can<00:05:47.169> be

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
as powerful because some of them can be

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.380 
as powerful because some of them can be
taken<00:05:47.590> out<00:05:47.770> of<00:05:47.950> turn<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.910> double<00:05:49.210> backs

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
usually flip one specific allege pan and

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.159 
usually flip one specific allege pan and
allow<00:05:51.850> you<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:52.090> do<00:05:52.240> something<00:05:52.630> else<00:05:52.780> if<00:05:53.050> you

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
allow you to do something else if you

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.780 
allow you to do something else if you
have<00:05:53.350> that<00:05:53.500> particular<00:05:53.979> item<00:05:54.190> in<00:05:54.460> front<00:05:54.700> of

have that particular item in front of

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.260 
have that particular item in front of
you<00:05:54.910> so<00:05:55.919> as<00:05:56.919> I<00:05:57.160> said<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.550> game<00:05:57.700> takes<00:05:58.000> probably

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
you so as I said the game takes probably

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.900 
you so as I said the game takes probably
about<00:05:58.570> 25<00:05:59.290> 30<00:05:59.590> minutes<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.070> play<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.580> can<00:06:00.700> last

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
about 25 30 minutes to play it can last

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.940 
about 25 30 minutes to play it can last
a<00:06:01.090> lot<00:06:01.240> longer<00:06:01.300> with<00:06:01.750> four<00:06:01.960> players<00:06:02.229> if<00:06:02.650> people

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
a lot longer with four players if people

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.219 
a lot longer with four players if people
are<00:06:03.040> keep<00:06:03.310> repeatedly<00:06:04.180> flipping<00:06:04.720> linchpins

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
are keep repeatedly flipping linchpins

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.590 
are keep repeatedly flipping linchpins
that<00:06:05.470> other<00:06:05.620> people<00:06:05.979> may<00:06:06.160> need<00:06:06.400> do<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.180> like<00:06:07.419> the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
that other people may need do I like the

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.380 
that other people may need do I like the
game<00:06:07.890> no<00:06:08.890> I<00:06:08.919> really<00:06:09.310> don't<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:09.880> it's<00:06:10.210> not

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
game no I really don't and it's not

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.210 
game no I really don't and it's not
because<00:06:10.570> it's<00:06:10.930> a<00:06:11.020> bad<00:06:11.200> game<00:06:11.470> so<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.740> say<00:06:12.010> it

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
because it's a bad game so to say it

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.830 
because it's a bad game so to say it
just<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.700> theme<00:06:12.970> doesn't<00:06:13.210> really<00:06:13.510> carry

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
just the theme doesn't really carry

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.420 
just the theme doesn't really carry
through<00:06:14.169> to<00:06:14.200> me<00:06:14.470> now<00:06:14.620> I<00:06:14.650> love<00:06:15.010> Back<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.400> the

through to me now I love Back to the

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.800 
through to me now I love Back to the
Future<00:06:15.520> I've<00:06:16.000> always<00:06:16.150> been<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:16.390> fan<00:06:16.450> of<00:06:16.630> the

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
Future I've always been a fan of the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.930 
Future I've always been a fan of the
movies<00:06:17.140> but<00:06:17.830> usually<00:06:18.400> you're<00:06:18.700> more

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
movies but usually you're more

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.880 
movies but usually you're more
concentrating<00:06:19.600> on<00:06:19.690> flipping<00:06:20.229> numbers<00:06:20.650> and

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
concentrating on flipping numbers and

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.890 
concentrating on flipping numbers and
you<00:06:20.979> are<00:06:21.160> in<00:06:21.430> what<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.030> actual<00:06:22.270> storyline<00:06:22.720> has

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
you are in what the actual storyline has

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.440 
you are in what the actual storyline has
to<00:06:23.260> offer<00:06:23.440> for<00:06:24.160> instance<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:24.970> doesn't<00:06:25.330> really

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
to offer for instance it doesn't really

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.150 
to offer for instance it doesn't really
matter<00:06:25.720> to<00:06:25.960> me<00:06:25.990> that<00:06:26.290> Claire<00:06:26.560> Clayton<00:06:26.950> falls

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
matter to me that Claire Clayton falls

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.010 
matter to me that Claire Clayton falls
into<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.490> ravine<00:06:27.820> or<00:06:28.060> not<00:06:28.210> or<00:06:28.600> if<00:06:28.660> they<00:06:28.870> have<00:06:28.990> a

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
into a ravine or not or if they have a

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.810 
into a ravine or not or if they have a
wedding<00:06:29.440> or<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:29.620> funeral<00:06:29.680> because<00:06:30.430> you<00:06:30.669> don't

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
wedding or a funeral because you don't

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.610 
wedding or a funeral because you don't
really<00:06:30.970> get<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.450> feeling<00:06:31.930> in<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:32.140> movie<00:06:32.440> or

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
really get that feeling in the movie or

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.710 
really get that feeling in the movie or
in<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.250> game<00:06:33.460> when<00:06:33.820> you're<00:06:33.940> just<00:06:34.300> flipping

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
in the game when you're just flipping

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.990 
in the game when you're just flipping
lunch<00:06:34.900> pins<00:06:35.169> to<00:06:35.440> get<00:06:35.860> to<00:06:36.070> one<00:06:36.250> specific<00:06:36.460> goal

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
lunch pins to get to one specific goal

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.700 
lunch pins to get to one specific goal
so<00:06:37.660> I<00:06:38.020> understand<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:38.800> point<00:06:38.950> of<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.190> game

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
so I understand the point of the game

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.200 
so I understand the point of the game
I understand<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:40.220> tie-in<00:06:40.460> with<00:06:40.580> the<00:06:40.700> license

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
I understand the tie-in with the license

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.210 
I understand the tie-in with the license
but<00:06:41.510> it's<00:06:41.660> not<00:06:41.840> really<00:06:42.110> a<00:06:42.230> fun<00:06:42.590> game<00:06:42.830> for<00:06:42.860> me

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
but it's not really a fun game for me

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.100 
but it's not really a fun game for me
it's<00:06:43.760> not<00:06:43.910> something<00:06:44.150> that<00:06:44.330> I<00:06:44.480> really<00:06:44.720> want<00:06:45.020> to

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
it's not something that I really want to

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.810 
it's not something that I really want to
play<00:06:45.340> a<00:06:46.340> lot<00:06:46.730> and<00:06:47.030> it's<00:06:47.930> well<00:06:48.230> done<00:06:48.440> the<00:06:49.400> cards

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
play a lot and it's well done the cards

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.030 
play a lot and it's well done the cards
are<00:06:50.030> typical<00:06:50.720> flux<00:06:50.990> cards<00:06:51.470> they're<00:06:51.770> very

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
are typical flux cards they're very

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.400 
are typical flux cards they're very
flimsy<00:06:52.480> you<00:06:53.480> would<00:06:53.630> need<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:53.810> sleeve<00:06:54.110> them<00:06:54.320> if

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
flimsy you would need to sleeve them if

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.500 
flimsy you would need to sleeve them if
you<00:06:54.530> so<00:06:54.710> wish<00:06:54.920> the<00:06:55.520> artwork<00:06:55.820> on<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.150> back<00:06:56.300> is

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
you so wish the artwork on the back is

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.940 
you so wish the artwork on the back is
all<00:06:56.660> right<00:06:56.900> I<00:06:56.930> don't<00:06:57.170> like<00:06:57.440> the<00:06:57.590> fact<00:06:57.770> that

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
all right I don't like the fact that

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.070 
all right I don't like the fact that
they<00:06:58.130> put<00:06:58.400> all<00:06:58.550> this<00:06:58.730> graphical<00:06:59.600> stuff<00:06:59.780> down

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
they put all this graphical stuff down

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.190 
they put all this graphical stuff down
here<00:07:00.110> with<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.310> properties<00:07:01.970> and<00:07:02.570> whatnot<00:07:02.930> but

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
here with the properties and whatnot but

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.160 
here with the properties and whatnot but
that's<00:07:03.830> their<00:07:04.040> choice<00:07:04.100> and<00:07:04.640> so<00:07:05.480> I<00:07:05.870> want<00:07:06.080> to

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170 
that's their choice and so I want to

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.540 
that's their choice and so I want to
give<00:07:06.260> everyone<00:07:06.470> a<00:07:06.590> good<00:07:06.710> idea<00:07:06.950> of<00:07:07.040> what<00:07:07.280> ships

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
give everyone a good idea of what ships

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.590 
give everyone a good idea of what ships
in<00:07:07.670> the<00:07:07.760> game<00:07:07.910> because<00:07:08.120> I've<00:07:08.180> seen<00:07:08.390> some

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
in the game because I've seen some

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.820 
in the game because I've seen some
videos<00:07:08.720> but<00:07:09.050> I<00:07:09.110> never<00:07:09.290> really<00:07:09.560> got<00:07:09.680> any

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
videos but I never really got any

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.100 
videos but I never really got any
close-ups<00:07:10.340> of<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:10.640> cards<00:07:10.970> themselves<00:07:11.030> and<00:07:11.690> I

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
close-ups of the cards themselves and I

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.780 
close-ups of the cards themselves and I
hope<00:07:12.290> this<00:07:12.470> gives<00:07:12.680> everybody<00:07:13.010> an<00:07:13.250> idea<00:07:13.700> of

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
hope this gives everybody an idea of

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.970 
hope this gives everybody an idea of
what<00:07:14.450> the<00:07:14.570> card<00:07:14.810> art<00:07:14.990> looks<00:07:15.200> like<00:07:15.440> and<00:07:15.800> maybe

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:15.980 
what the card art looks like and maybe

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.520 
what the card art looks like and maybe
it's<00:07:16.220> something<00:07:16.430> you<00:07:16.700> want<00:07:16.730> to<00:07:17.090> buy<00:07:17.210> or<00:07:17.540> skip

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
it's something you want to buy or skip

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.870 
it's something you want to buy or skip
and<00:07:18.710> go<00:07:18.740> directly<00:07:19.010> to<00:07:19.280> something<00:07:19.400> a<00:07:19.670> little

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
and go directly to something a little

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.000 
and go directly to something a little
more<00:07:20.000> in<00:07:20.180> depth<00:07:20.390> like<00:07:20.600> Croatoan<00:07:20.900> odds<00:07:21.080> so<00:07:21.770> that

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
more in depth like Croatoan odds so that

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.650 
more in depth like Croatoan odds so that
is<00:07:22.220> back<00:07:22.460> to<00:07:22.670> the<00:07:22.700> future<00:07:22.820> and<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.630> hope

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
is back to the future and I hope

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.360 
is back to the future and I hope
everyone<00:07:24.170> enjoyed<00:07:24.470> it<00:07:24.620> thanks<00:07:25.010> again<00:07:25.190> for
