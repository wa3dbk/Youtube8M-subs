00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.059 
taking a chain-link fence down we're
gonna<00:00:03.389> put<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> wooden<00:00:03.870> fence<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.380> its<00:00:04.529> place

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069

there we go
we<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> post<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.840> 1<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.199> 6

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
we just make up a post that are 1 by 6

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.259 
we just make up a post that are 1 by 6
cut<00:00:21.060> down<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.539> 3<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> half<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.939> inch<00:00:24.090> in

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
cut down to 3 and a half and the inch in

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.300 
cut down to 3 and a half and the inch in
3/4<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.170> stick<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> over<00:00:25.650> top<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
3/4 and we stick it over top of the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570 
3/4 and we stick it over top of the
steel<00:00:26.550> post<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.449> never<00:00:27.980> never<00:00:28.980> rots

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
steel post and then it never never rots

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.880 
steel post and then it never never rots
or<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.630> does<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.050> doesn't<00:00:31.380> rot<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
or if it does it doesn't rot in the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
or if it does it doesn't rot in the
clunk<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> ground<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.690> rots<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.079> little

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
clunk in the ground just rots a little

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.270 
clunk in the ground just rots a little
bit<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:35.329> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.680> face<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.920> things<00:00:38.129> but

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
bit in there on the face of things but

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
bit in there on the face of things but
we're<00:00:38.460> gonna<00:00:38.550> lift<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
we're gonna lift it up a little bit so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.139 
we're gonna lift it up a little bit so
it<00:00:40.590> doesn't<00:00:40.950> rot<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
it doesn't rot so that's how to make a

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.840 
it doesn't rot so that's how to make a
chain-link<00:00:45.149> fence<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> turn<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
chain-link fence and turn it into a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.959 
chain-link fence and turn it into a
wooden<00:00:50.850> fence<00:00:51.559> without<00:00:52.559> three<00:00:52.980> reposting

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
wooden fence without three reposting

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.860 
wooden fence without three reposting
everything<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.680> wrong<00:00:56.870> make

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
everything what do you think wrong make

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
everything what do you think wrong make
a<00:00:57.989> fence<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.620> post<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.730> about<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a fence from a post so this is about the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.050 
a fence from a post so this is about the
halfway<00:01:03.270> point<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> fence<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:05.939> i'm

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
halfway point on the fence and what i'm

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.230 
halfway point on the fence and what i'm
gonna<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.900> how<00:01:07.729> always<00:01:08.729> fastened

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
gonna show you is how always fastened

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
gonna show you is how always fastened
this<00:01:10.400> what<00:01:11.400> i<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> set<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.630> board<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.110> each

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this what i do is set one board at each

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
this what i do is set one board at each
end<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:14.010> tack<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.750> level<00:01:16.280> level

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
end and i tack that in and level level

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.440 
end and i tack that in and level level
it<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> bottom<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.530> end<00:01:19.830> too

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
it in at the bottom and this end too

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
it in at the bottom and this end too
you'll<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> height<00:01:21.960> difference<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you'll see the height difference here so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.510 
you'll see the height difference here so
then<00:01:23.700> after<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.170> got<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.380> board<00:01:25.680> set<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.280> each

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then after a got one board set at each

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
then after a got one board set at each
end<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.970> runs<00:01:27.210> downhill<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.290> that's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
end this runs downhill a bit so that's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010 
end this runs downhill a bit so that's
why<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> height<00:01:28.979> difference<00:01:29.479> then<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.630> level

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
why the height difference then i level

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.069 
why the height difference then i level
in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> top<00:01:31.560> board<00:01:32.390> with<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> spirit<00:01:33.900> level

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
in the top board with the spirit level

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
in the top board with the spirit level
and<00:01:35.030> i<00:01:36.030> bring<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> rest<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and i bring all the rest up so that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.160 
and i bring all the rest up so that
there<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> 3/4<00:01:38.880> inch<00:01:39.030> gap<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.079> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
there you have that 3/4 inch gap and I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.350 
there you have that 3/4 inch gap and I
can<00:01:40.350> set<00:01:40.530> my<00:01:40.710> lattice<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
can set my lattice in to that it's just

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
can set my lattice in to that it's just
a<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:45.810> fence<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.439> build<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
a very good fence to build because you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
a very good fence to build because you
can<00:01:47.450> stay<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> bottom<00:01:49.170> grade<00:01:49.409> pretty

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
can stay with the bottom grade pretty

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.520 
can stay with the bottom grade pretty
easily<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.670> still<00:01:51.450> stay<00:01:51.720> level<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> top

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
easily and still stay level on the top

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
easily and still stay level on the top
not<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:55.159> like<00:01:56.159> those<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> fences<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
not like like those kind of fences that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
not like like those kind of fences that
are<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.659> made<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.110> sections

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
are just made with sections

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.080 
are just made with sections
it<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:01.590> stay<00:02:01.829> level<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> top<00:02:02.579> look<00:02:02.880> nice

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it can stay level on the top look nice

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.389 
it can stay level on the top look nice
and<00:02:03.299> neat<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.530> could<00:02:04.740> still<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.219> your

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and neat and you could still have your

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.180 
and neat and you could still have your
bottom<00:02:05.729> closed<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
bottom closed so that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.030 
bottom closed so that
most<00:02:07.400> can't<00:02:07.700> go<00:02:07.850> under<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.680> that<00:02:09.680> sort<00:02:09.950> of

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
most can't go under it that sort of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.970

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.370 
section in each of these I'll show you
that<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.550> bit<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.600> I'll<00:02:23.720> show<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:23.960> how<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.260> set

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
that in a bit so I'll show you how I set

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.350 
that in a bit so I'll show you how I set
these<00:02:24.800> posts<00:02:26.650> posters<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:27.950> put<00:02:28.180> put<00:02:29.180> these

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
these posts posters and I put put these

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.310 
these posts posters and I put put these
bottom<00:02:29.750> pieces<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:30.290> first<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.220> see<00:02:31.460> here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
bottom pieces in first that can see here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.180 
bottom pieces in first that can see here
just<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.500> spread<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:36.190> attach

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
just to spread it and then I I attach

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.240 
just to spread it and then I I attach
one<00:02:37.490> post<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.940> each<00:02:38.150> end<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
one post to each end here this is the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.450 
one post to each end here this is the
high<00:02:40.460> end<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:41.290> bottom<00:02:42.290> sort<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.800> slopes<00:02:43.100> over

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
high end the bottom sort of slopes over

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.510 
high end the bottom sort of slopes over
this<00:02:43.610> right<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> attach<00:02:45.590> one<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.040> each<00:02:46.190> end

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
this right so I attach one on each end

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.300 
this right so I attach one on each end
one<00:02:47.000> post<00:02:47.390> there<00:02:47.750> one<00:02:47.900> picket<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
one post there one picket and then I

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.540 
one post there one picket and then I
take<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.420> level<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.800> make<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.250> spreader

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
take the level and I make the spreader

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.510 
take the level and I make the spreader
across<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.240> top<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.070> just<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.340> 1

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
across the top of this which is just a 1

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
across the top of this which is just a 1
by<00:02:55.700> 6<00:02:55.730> Cedar<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.770> set<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.490> 3/4<00:02:59.150> at<00:02:59.360> that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
by 6 Cedar and I set it for 3/4 at that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.740 
by 6 Cedar and I set it for 3/4 at that
end<00:03:00.190> because<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.460> have<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.820> lattice<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.570> want

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
end because I have a lattice that I want

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.770 
end because I have a lattice that I want
to<00:03:02.840> sit<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:04.090> at<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.300> end<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.750> just

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
to sit in there and at this end I just

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.110 
to sit in there and at this end I just
go<00:03:06.140> level<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.830> whatever<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.340> ends<00:03:07.520> up<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.970> be

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
go level and whatever it ends up to be

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.910 
go level and whatever it ends up to be
that's<00:03:08.420> fine<00:03:08.720> because<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.320> lots<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.680> play

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
that's fine because I have lots of play

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.520 
that's fine because I have lots of play
in<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:11.360> when<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.540> put<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:11.810> pickets<00:03:12.350> on

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
in that and when I put my pickets on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.680 
in that and when I put my pickets on
then<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.510> carry<00:03:14.510> them<00:03:14.780> down<00:03:15.550> at<00:03:16.550> 3/4<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.600> then

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
then I carry them down at 3/4 and then

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.479 
then I carry them down at 3/4 and then
that<00:03:17.900> end<00:03:18.110> one<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.530> drops<00:03:18.800> off<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.280> it's

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
that end one just drops off and it's

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.790 
that end one just drops off and it's
whatever<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:20.030> wants<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:21.550> that's<00:03:22.550> just<00:03:23.800> an

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
whatever it wants to be that's just an

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.410 
whatever it wants to be that's just an
interesting<00:03:24.980> way<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.550> building<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.090> fence

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
interesting way of building that fence

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.690 
interesting way of building that fence
so<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.110> tops<00:03:27.350> all<00:03:27.620> look<00:03:27.860> nicely<00:03:28.130> stepped

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
so that the tops all look nicely stepped

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.240 
so that the tops all look nicely stepped
up<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.080> proper<00:03:31.300> level<00:03:32.300> fashion<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
up in a proper level fashion and the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.550 
up in a proper level fashion and the
bottoms<00:03:34.610> close<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.270> gap<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:36.080> doesn't<00:03:36.380> matter

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
bottoms close the gap it doesn't matter

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.410 
bottoms close the gap it doesn't matter
where<00:03:36.800> that<00:03:36.950> bottom<00:03:37.340> one<00:03:37.370> ends<00:03:37.790> up<00:03:37.910> because

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
where that bottom one ends up because

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
where that bottom one ends up because
it's<00:03:38.650> right<00:03:39.650> at<00:03:39.830> grade<00:03:40.070> level<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:42.260> want

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
it's right at grade level and you want

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.620 
it's right at grade level and you want
it<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.860> stop<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.580> little<00:03:43.880> animals<00:03:44.360> or<00:03:44.450> plants

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
it to stop the little animals or plants

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.410 
it to stop the little animals or plants
from<00:03:44.989> creeping<00:03:45.470> under<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.820> can<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.209> doesn't

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
from creeping under so it can it doesn't

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
from creeping under so it can it doesn't
have<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.840> be<00:03:47.959> level<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.580> design<00:03:50.440> then

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
have to be level in this design then

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.380 
have to be level in this design then
afterwards<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.160> course<00:03:52.190> I'll<00:03:52.640> put<00:03:52.820> my<00:03:52.970> lattice

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
afterwards of course I'll put my lattice

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.410 
afterwards of course I'll put my lattice
in<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.590> I'll<00:03:54.709> put<00:03:54.890> another<00:03:55.010> facing<00:03:55.730> piece<00:03:56.180> on

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
in and I'll put another facing piece on

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.729 
in and I'll put another facing piece on
the<00:03:56.540> front<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.830> I'll<00:03:57.950> show<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:59.739> so

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
the front and I'll show you that so

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.310 
the front and I'll show you that so
here's<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.220> finished<00:04:01.370> fence

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
here's the finished fence

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.690 
here's the finished fence
we<00:04:03.320> put

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
we put

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.190 
we put
there's<00:04:05.510> little<00:04:05.810> tiny<00:04:06.530> caps<00:04:06.950> on<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:07.580> that

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
there's little tiny caps on here that

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.610 
there's little tiny caps on here that
hold<00:04:09.200> up<00:04:09.970> they<00:04:10.970> help<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.390> hold<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.780> post

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
hold up they help to hold the post

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.850 
hold up they help to hold the post
together<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.250> guess<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> little<00:04:13.910> bit<00:04:14.860> because

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
together I guess a little bit because

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.479 
together I guess a little bit because
they<00:04:16.130> drop<00:04:16.370> down<00:04:16.609> over<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.000> top<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.450> it

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
they drop down over the top of it

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.970 
they drop down over the top of it
that's<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.700> fence
