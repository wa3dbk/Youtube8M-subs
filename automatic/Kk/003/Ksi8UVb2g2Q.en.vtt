Assassin's<00:00:16.770> Creed<00:00:16.949> has<00:00:16.980> been<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> env3<00:00:18.300> since

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since
the<00:00:18.869> beginning<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.650> know<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> develop

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the beginning so we know how to develop

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
the beginning so we know how to develop
for<00:00:20.910> ps3<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.380> enjoying

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying
developing<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.400> ps4<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.720> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
developing for ps4 first thing that is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.089 
developing for ps4 first thing that is
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.960> change<00:00:25.019> drastically<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
going to change drastically as the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to change drastically as the
graphics<00:00:26.550> because<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> visually

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
graphics because we think that visually

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.009 
graphics because we think that visually
with<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> stronger<00:00:29.310> GPU<00:00:29.730> stronger<00:00:30.119> cpu<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> lot

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
with the stronger GPU stronger cpu a lot

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959 
with the stronger GPU stronger cpu a lot
of<00:00:31.140> ram<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.679> gonna<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:32.009> able<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> exploit<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of ram we're gonna be able to exploit a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940 
of ram we're gonna be able to exploit a
lot<00:00:33.239> discounsel<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.020> push<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> bar<00:00:34.559> visual

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
lot discounsel and push the bar visual

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.069 
lot discounsel and push the bar visual
it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:35.579> intuitive<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.570> engineers

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers
it's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.070> compute<00:00:38.730> shaders

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
it's a lot more like compute shaders

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299 
it's a lot more like compute shaders
that<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.390> add<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> ps4<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and
all<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.420> new<00:00:42.780> texts<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.230> we're<00:00:43.320> pushing

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
all these new texts that we're pushing

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.540 
all these new texts that we're pushing
are<00:00:44.010> natively<00:00:44.879> fitting<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> ps4<00:00:46.550> all

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all
little<00:00:48.149> details<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.170> cannot<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.829> now

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
little details that you cannot right now

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
little details that you cannot right now
put<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> current<00:00:51.210> generation<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
put on the current generation of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
put on the current generation of
consoles<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.949> council<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.399> being

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
consoles because the council is being

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.160 
consoles because the council is being
fully<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.539> running<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.870> hundred

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
fully like it's running a hundred

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
fully like it's running a hundred
percent<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.789> cannot<00:00:57.000> add<00:00:57.239> all

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
percent right now so you cannot add all

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
percent right now so you cannot add all
these<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:58.050> details<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
these little details that are going to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
these little details that are going to
make<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> game<00:00:59.399> even<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.730> beautiful<00:01:00.059> more

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
make the game even more beautiful more

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.529 
make the game even more beautiful more
immersive<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.829> overall<00:01:02.340> ps4<00:01:03.059> experience

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
immersive the overall ps4 experience

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
immersive the overall ps4 experience
that<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> game<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.830> much<00:01:04.979> better

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that make the game look so much better

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.910 
that make the game look so much better
on<00:01:05.489> ps4<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.960> definitely<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.680> share

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
on ps4 I think definitely the share

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380 
on ps4 I think definitely the share
button<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.430> something<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.180> cool

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
button is something really really cool

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.710 
button is something really really cool
because<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.820> allow<00:01:11.820> us<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.060> keep<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
because now it will allow us to keep the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
because now it will allow us to keep the
single-player<00:01:13.170> experience<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
single-player experience but make it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
single-player experience but make it
connected<00:01:14.909> trying<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> blend<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.619> together

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
connected trying to blend more together

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
connected trying to blend more together
like<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.369> friends<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> still<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.000> even

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
like your friends are still there even

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
like your friends are still there even
if<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:18.810> playing<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.200> single-player<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
if you're playing in single-player you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.810 
if you're playing in single-player you
don't<00:01:20.100> necessarily<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> play

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
don't necessarily want to play

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
don't necessarily want to play
multiplayer<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.540> necessarily<00:01:21.930> wanna<00:01:22.170> like

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
multiplayer don't necessarily wanna like

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
multiplayer don't necessarily wanna like
fight<00:01:22.890> against<00:01:23.280> another<00:01:23.490> player<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.229> then

we're also going to add like the
companion<00:01:26.880> gaming<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
companion gaming so it's going to be a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
companion gaming so it's going to be a
nice<00:01:28.799> evolution<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.700> terms<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> gaming

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
nice evolution in terms of the gaming

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
nice evolution in terms of the gaming
world<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.710> assassins<00:01:32.130> creed<00:01:32.280> 4<00:01:32.340> black<00:01:32.549> flag

will<00:01:33.360> merge<00:01:33.810> round<00:01:34.530> gameplay<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> naval

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
will merge round gameplay and naval

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.319 
will merge round gameplay and naval
gameplay<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.040> able<00:01:38.329> totally

seamless boarding so
right<00:01:49.539> now<00:01:49.689> you're<00:01:49.899> going<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.409> sea<00:01:50.680> you're

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
right now you're going in the sea you're

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.520 
right now you're going in the sea you're
seeing<00:01:51.700> another<00:01:51.909> ship<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.750> attack<00:01:53.079> him<00:01:53.289> and
