My name is Khaldoon Sinjab

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.190
Infected with quadriplegic since 1994

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.140
but my disability didn't
stop me from pursuing my career

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
I work now as a programmer, system administrator

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.190
web designer

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.190
for almost 20 years

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.000
and as an employee for several companies

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.000
for almost 12 years

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.150
and I work in other fields

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.040
such as programming desktop and mobile applications

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.150
and server administrator and web programing

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.020
I tried and i did translate many books

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.030
from English to Arabic

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.190
and I read many programming books translated to
Arabic and I realized how bad the translation is

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.190
therefor I have a plan and an idea
to improve the translation level

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.200
technically and literary

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.110
using a new participatory interactive website

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
anyone can access and participate in building
the best translation and evaluate it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the website mechanism

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.060
will work to select the best translation

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.050
and it will be a free service

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.240
as the website will also contain a  terminology dictionary

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.230
visitors will be involved in 
creating it participatory

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.130
the website aim is to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
create a new vacancies for translators

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.000
so they can translate easier

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.140
and with high quality

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.130
using a participatory translation
which is always updated

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.190
and allowing the normal user

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.090
to follow this translation and updating it
continuously, and commenting it

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.130
this project requires a technical
and financial support

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.170
and via bedaea website

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.020
I submit my project

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.020
to get the required support
to complete my project

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.180
as I would like to thank bedaea website
team for giving me this opportunity

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.240
