00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
now we're ready to glaze with the wooly

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.030 
now we're ready to glaze with the wooly

we're going to use the big brush and the
wooly<00:02:36.250> now<00:02:36.910> I've<00:02:37.060> applied<00:02:37.359> a<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.750> bit<00:02:37.900> of

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
wooly now I've applied a little bit of

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.840 
wooly now I've applied a little bit of
glaze<00:02:38.319> on<00:02:38.590> my<00:02:38.950> woolly

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
glaze on my woolly

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.479 
glaze on my woolly
before<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> begin<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.049> I'm<00:02:41.920> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
before I begin and I'm going to take the

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.039 
before I begin and I'm going to take the
brush<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.889> apply<00:02:44.889> a<00:02:45.340> splash<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.970> glaze<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
brush and apply a splash of glaze to the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.289 
brush and apply a splash of glaze to the
surface<00:02:47.530> from<00:02:48.280> there<00:02:48.579> I'm<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.030> take<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
surface from there I'm going to take the

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.390 
surface from there I'm going to take the
wooly<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.780> I'm<00:02:50.290> actually<00:02:50.440> going<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.829> begin<00:02:51.190> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
wooly and I'm actually going to begin a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.599 
wooly and I'm actually going to begin a
jabbing<00:02:52.030> kind<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.600> jagang<00:02:53.260> motion<00:02:53.980> to

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
jabbing kind of a jagang motion to

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.150 
jabbing kind of a jagang motion to
create<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.120> look<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.389> I'm<00:02:55.750> after<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:57.040> I'm

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
create the look that I'm after what I'm

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.990 
create the look that I'm after what I'm
doing<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.670> I'm<00:02:57.819> spreading<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.599> glaze<00:02:58.959> out<00:03:00.000> now

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
doing is I'm spreading the glaze out now

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.170 
doing is I'm spreading the glaze out now
these<00:03:01.209> edges<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.579> leave<00:03:03.760> them<00:03:03.910> kind

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
these edges here you can leave them kind

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610 
these edges here you can leave them kind
of<00:03:04.269> raw<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> think<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.440> most

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
of raw but I think that the most

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.190 
of raw but I think that the most
effective<00:03:06.069> way<00:03:06.579> is<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.940> kind<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.630> fade<00:03:07.930> them

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
effective way is to kind of fade them

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.659 
effective way is to kind of fade them
down<00:03:08.410> where<00:03:09.130> they<00:03:09.250> fade<00:03:09.609> down<00:03:09.880> into<00:03:10.480> nothing

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
down where they fade down into nothing

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:20.099 
down where they fade down into nothing
like<00:03:12.669> so<00:03:15.780> from<00:03:16.780> there<00:03:17.139> we<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:19.120> ahead<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.720> throw

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
like so from there we go ahead and throw

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.360 
like so from there we go ahead and throw
another<00:03:20.290> splotch<00:03:21.099> on<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> surface

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.930 

and<00:03:24.519> continued<00:03:25.360> glazing<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.280> jabbing

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
and continued glazing with a jabbing

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.910 
and continued glazing with a jabbing
motion<00:03:28.120> with<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.780> woolie<00:03:28.989> now<00:03:29.620> what<00:03:29.799> I'm

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
motion with the woolie now what I'm

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.710 
motion with the woolie now what I'm
gonna<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.640> I'm<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:30.940> spreading

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
gonna do here is I'm actually spreading

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.649 
gonna do here is I'm actually spreading
this<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.650> fades<00:03:32.950> over<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:34.000> area<00:03:34.330> so

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
this out so it fades over this area so

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.320 
this out so it fades over this area so
they<00:03:34.810> kind<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.140> fade<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.280> overlap<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.030> create

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
they kind of fade and overlap to create

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.509 
they kind of fade and overlap to create
a<00:03:37.390> nice<00:03:37.659> transition<00:03:38.549> like<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.730> see<00:03:40.000> here<00:03:40.360> I

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
a nice transition like you see here I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:50.190 
a nice transition like you see here I
don't<00:03:42.519> leave<00:03:42.730> any<00:03:43.000> harsh<00:03:43.420> lines<00:03:48.900> now<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.079> we

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
don't leave any harsh lines now when we

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.490 
don't leave any harsh lines now when we
get<00:03:50.379> up<00:03:50.500> next<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.890> our<00:03:50.980> edges<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.610> corners

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
get up next to our edges and corners

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.240 
get up next to our edges and corners
we'll<00:03:53.500> apply<00:03:53.739> our<00:03:53.980> glaze<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.799> like<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.099> take

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
we'll apply our glaze and I like to take

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.710 
we'll apply our glaze and I like to take
the<00:03:57.430> brush<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.670> run<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> right<00:03:58.329> along<00:03:58.390> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the brush and run it right along the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.770 
the brush and run it right along the
edge<00:03:59.879> spreading<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:01.000> glaze<00:04:01.209> into<00:04:01.599> those

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
edge spreading the glaze into those

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.309 
edge spreading the glaze into those
areas<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.129> take<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.459> woolie<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.540> I

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
areas then I take the woolie and I

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.339 
areas then I take the woolie and I
actually<00:04:05.650> push<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.129> in<00:04:06.340> those<00:04:06.579> areas<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.390> that

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
actually push it in those areas so that

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.530 
actually push it in those areas so that
we<00:04:08.620> end<00:04:08.769> up<00:04:08.980> with<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.159> nice

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
we end up with a nice

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.770 
we end up with a nice
professional-looking

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
professional-looking

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.229 
professional-looking
edge<00:04:11.049> line<00:04:12.780> jabbing<00:04:13.780> through<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:15.879> really

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
edge line jabbing through this is really

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.210 
edge line jabbing through this is really
a<00:04:16.269> remarkably<00:04:16.959> fast<00:04:17.350> technique

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220
