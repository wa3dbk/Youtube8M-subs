well I hope you get an idea of the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
well I hope you get an idea of the
different<00:02:43.150> styles<00:02:43.600> there<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> know<00:02:44.080> they<00:02:44.320> were

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
different styles there I know they were

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.070 
different styles there I know they were
all<00:02:44.470> brief<00:02:44.860> examples<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.600> think<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.960> can

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
all brief examples but I think you can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.420 
all brief examples but I think you can
listen<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> each<00:02:47.560> one<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:47.890> hear<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
listen to each one and hear the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.530 
listen to each one and hear the
difference<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> many<00:02:52.120> different<00:02:52.450> ways

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
difference it's so many different ways

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.980 
difference it's so many different ways
of<00:02:52.750> playing<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.140> same<00:02:53.350> exact<00:02:54.010> chords<00:02:54.610> and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
of playing the same exact chords and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.590 
of playing the same exact chords and
everything<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:57.030> nothing<00:02:58.030> wrong<00:02:58.150> with<00:02:58.330> any<00:02:58.480> of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
everything and nothing wrong with any of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.660 
everything and nothing wrong with any of
those<00:02:58.690> styles<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.650> all<00:02:59.770> certainly<00:03:00.160> depends<00:03:00.550> on

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
those styles it all certainly depends on

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.560 
those styles it all certainly depends on
on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:02.410> sound<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.950> want<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.570> so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
on the sound that you want and so

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.840 
on the sound that you want and so
experiment<00:03:05.110> with<00:03:05.200> those<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:06.490> would<00:03:06.640> like

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
experiment with those if you would like
