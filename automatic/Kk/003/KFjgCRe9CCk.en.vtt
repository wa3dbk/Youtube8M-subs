have some ROG flash we're gonna have

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
have some ROG flash we're gonna have
three<00:03:26.870> strands<00:03:27.440> on<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.709> one<00:03:27.889> side<00:03:28.100> three

three strands on the one side three

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.710 
three strands on the one side three
strands<00:03:29.000> I'd<00:03:29.180> rather<00:03:30.910> think<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.060> last<00:03:32.269> time<00:03:32.569> I

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
strands I'd rather think the last time I

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 
strands I'd rather think the last time I
tied<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.170> why<00:03:33.380> use<00:03:33.769> two<00:03:34.010> strands<00:03:35.000> on<00:03:35.269> each

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
tied this why use two strands on each

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:44.440 
tied this why use two strands on each
side<00:03:35.750> that's<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.170> very<00:03:36.680> scientific<00:03:43.239> cut<00:03:44.239> this

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
side that's a very scientific cut this

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.080 
side that's a very scientific cut this
about<00:03:44.660> as<00:03:45.170> long<00:03:45.380> as<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.100> total<00:03:46.370> 5<00:03:46.850> will<00:03:47.150> be

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
about as long as the total 5 will be

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.150 
about as long as the total 5 will be
type<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.299> that<00:03:50.420> on<00:03:50.540> one<00:03:50.780> side<00:03:50.810> time<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
type of that on one side time in on the

type of that on one side time in on the
other<00:03:52.250> side<00:03:53.920> now<00:03:54.920> let's<00:03:55.310> put<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> little<00:03:56.120> bit<00:03:56.450> of

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
other side now let's put a little bit of

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.640 
other side now let's put a little bit of
I<00:03:59.260> could<00:04:00.260> use<00:04:01.780> bright<00:04:02.780> car<00:04:03.200> but<00:04:03.620> I'm<00:04:03.799> going<00:04:04.250> to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
I could use bright car but I'm going to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.360 
I could use bright car but I'm going to
this<00:04:04.799> kind<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.310> uh<00:04:06.290> since<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.040> part

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
this kind of uh since this is this part

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.490 
this kind of uh since this is this part
of<00:04:08.430> PI's<00:04:08.670> can<00:04:08.939> show<00:04:09.239> I'm<00:04:09.540> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.959> look<00:04:10.110> nice

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
of PI's can show I'm going to look nice

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.960 
of PI's can show I'm going to look nice
so<00:04:12.680> I'm<00:04:13.680> gonna<00:04:13.829> use<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.189> dubbing<00:04:14.610> loop<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.669> put

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
so I'm gonna use it dubbing loop and put

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.029 
so I'm gonna use it dubbing loop and put
in<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.180> little<00:04:18.329> bit<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.660> STS<00:04:19.440> try<00:04:19.979> mobile<00:04:20.639> blend

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
in a little bit of STS try mobile blend

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.100 
in a little bit of STS try mobile blend
it's<00:04:23.039> got<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> little<00:04:23.610> purple<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.630> it's<00:04:24.930> got

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
it's got a little purple in it it's got

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.110 
it's got a little purple in it it's got
a<00:04:25.139> little<00:04:25.350> bit<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.800> black<00:04:26.070> it's<00:04:26.639> got<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.910> little

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
a little bit of black it's got a little

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.170 
a little bit of black it's got a little
bit<00:04:29.630> silver<00:04:30.630> holographic<00:04:31.110> ice<00:04:32.100> dub<00:04:35.180> things

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
bit silver holographic ice dub things

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.379 
bit silver holographic ice dub things
are<00:04:36.330> amazing<00:04:36.780> aren't<00:04:36.930> they<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.970> much<00:04:39.120> fun

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
are amazing aren't they so much fun

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.600 
are amazing aren't they so much fun
trying<00:04:39.750> these<00:04:39.930> different<00:04:40.320> things<00:04:40.440> out<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:44.430> get

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
trying these different things out to get

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.070 
trying these different things out to get
my<00:04:44.729> little<00:04:44.910> dubbing<00:04:45.330> brush<00:04:47.690> unless<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.900> left

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
my little dubbing brush unless I left

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.270 
my little dubbing brush unless I left
half<00:04:49.289> my<00:04:49.350> tools<00:04:49.770> at<00:04:49.949> home<00:04:50.100> today

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
half my tools at home today

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.439 
half my tools at home today
so<00:04:53.280> then<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.699> wind<00:04:54.449> this<00:04:54.720> around<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:57.150> idea

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
so then you wind this around the idea

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.749 
so then you wind this around the idea
here<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:58.910> fill<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.650> space<00:05:01.650> against<00:05:02.610> the

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
here is to fill that space against the

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.370 
here is to fill that space against the
Kong<00:05:03.060> head<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:05.250> want<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.729> pretty<00:05:06.090> tight

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.800 

it's<00:05:10.380> partly<00:05:10.919> for<00:05:11.310> looks<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:11.880> partly<00:05:12.449> for

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
it's partly for looks and partly for

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.230 
it's partly for looks and partly for
function<00:05:13.530> because<00:05:13.949> if<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.310> code<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.880> gonna

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
function because if that code is gonna

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.939 
function because if that code is gonna
loose<00:05:15.599> it<00:05:16.760> could<00:05:17.760> rattle<00:05:18.120> around<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.380> your

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
loose it could rattle around and your

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:30.700 
loose it could rattle around and your
thread<00:05:20.490> could

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.890 

so<00:05:31.280> here<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.580> go<00:05:31.699> so<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:34.639> just<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.180> see<00:05:35.419> me<00:05:35.479> tie

so here we go so you just you see me tie

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.020 
so here we go so you just you see me tie

eggs all over the table you know I've
just<00:06:08.030> made<00:06:08.449> tying<00:06:08.960> this<00:06:09.229> fry<00:06:10.389> three<00:06:11.389> times

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
just made tying this fry three times

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.219 
just made tying this fry three times
more<00:06:11.990> complicated<00:06:14.080> by<00:06:15.080> adding<00:06:15.530> these<00:06:15.710> beads

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
more complicated by adding these beads

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:27.540 
more complicated by adding these beads
throw<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.259> bead<00:06:18.470> on<00:06:20.530> run<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.860> first<00:06:26.050> everybody

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
throw a bead on run the first everybody

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.390 
throw a bead on run the first everybody
think<00:06:28.550> nice<00:06:28.729> thoughts<00:06:28.759> there<00:06:29.419> we<00:06:29.479> go

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
think nice thoughts there we go

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.810 
think nice thoughts there we go
but<00:06:31.400> how<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.580> beat<00:06:31.789> on<00:06:33.460> this<00:06:34.460> is<00:06:34.610> going<00:06:34.760> to

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
but how to beat on this is going to

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.460 
but how to beat on this is going to
wiggle<00:06:35.090> in<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.240> water<00:06:35.449> oh<00:06:35.750> my<00:06:36.050> goodness

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
wiggle in the water oh my goodness

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.330 
wiggle in the water oh my goodness
that's<00:06:39.470> too<00:06:39.680> long<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:40.490> shorten<00:06:40.880> up<00:06:42.250> there<00:06:43.250> we

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
that's too long you shorten up there we

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.100 
that's too long you shorten up there we
go

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
go

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.930 
go
hope<00:06:45.110> my<00:06:45.139> piece<00:06:45.530> only<00:06:45.770> tours<00:06:46.190> long<00:06:46.400> enough<00:06:46.729> to

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
hope my piece only tours long enough to

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.529 
hope my piece only tours long enough to
do<00:06:47.060> this<00:06:47.240> demonstration<00:06:52.300> they're<00:06:53.300> on<00:06:53.389> how<00:06:53.479> to

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
do this demonstration they're on how to

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.670 
do this demonstration they're on how to
be<00:06:53.720> on

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.670 

it's<00:06:59.250> actually<00:06:59.639> going<00:06:59.910> much<00:07:00.180> better<00:07:00.530> than<00:07:01.530> it

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
it's actually going much better than it

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:10.689 
it's actually going much better than it
could<00:07:02.690> here<00:07:03.690> comes<00:07:04.010> the<00:07:05.010> conehead<00:07:06.229> section

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.320 

how's<00:07:11.699> that<00:07:12.199> the<00:07:13.199> mirage<00:07:14.190> flash<00:07:14.639> abou<00:07:14.970> comes
