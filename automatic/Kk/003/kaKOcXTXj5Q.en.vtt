so very strange Martin has mastered and
how<00:00:30.530> the<00:00:31.340> art<00:00:31.610> of<00:00:31.880> freezing<00:00:32.660> images<00:00:33.200> critical

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
how the art of freezing images critical

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.220 
how the art of freezing images critical
time<00:00:34.100> it's<00:00:34.489> pretty<00:00:34.760> put<00:00:35.030> in<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.270> while<00:00:35.540> now<00:00:35.840> he

the next minute if you're within five
feet<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> table<00:00:47.000> all<00:00:47.630> Martin<00:00:48.140> has<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.380> do

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
feet of the table all Martin has to do

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.330 
feet of the table all Martin has to do
is<00:00:50.239> provide<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.020> water<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.530> some<00:00:51.920> colored

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
is provide the water and some colored

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.950 
is provide the water and some colored
lights<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.820> think<00:00:53.060> everything<00:00:53.239> that's<00:00:53.510> great<00:00:53.750> I

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
lights I think everything that's great I

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.870 
lights I think everything that's great I
like<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:54.410> I'm<00:00:55.280> going<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.460> present<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.850> your

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
like it I'm going to present you your

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.729 
like it I'm going to present you your
first<00:00:56.270> high-speed<00:00:56.660> video<00:00:57.079> drop<00:00:57.590> excellent

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
first high-speed video drop excellent

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.749 
first high-speed video drop excellent
yeah<00:01:00.739> splash<00:01:01.430> oh<00:01:01.730> yeah<00:01:03.129> I've<00:01:04.129> never<00:01:04.309> seen<00:01:04.579> this

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
yeah splash oh yeah I've never seen this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.520 
yeah splash oh yeah I've never seen this
with<00:01:04.879> my<00:01:05.030> stuff<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.630> great<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.380> we<00:01:06.500> can

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
with my stuff this is great so we can

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.530 
with my stuff this is great so we can
see<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.890> whole<00:01:07.070> process<00:01:07.430> let's<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.270> put

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
see the whole process let's just put

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.850 
see the whole process let's just put
that<00:01:08.570> right<00:01:08.840> back<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.200> beginning<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
that right back to the beginning and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.700 
that right back to the beginning and
check<00:01:10.219> it<00:01:10.340> out<00:01:10.430> again<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:11.450> droplet<00:01:11.990> digs<00:01:12.440> out

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
check it out again the droplet digs out

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.390 
check it out again the droplet digs out
a<00:01:12.920> crater<00:01:13.460> which<00:01:14.210> forms<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.690> crowd<00:01:14.960> or<00:01:15.400> coronet

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
a crater which forms a crowd or coronet

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.810 
a crater which forms a crowd or coronet
the<00:01:17.210> crater<00:01:17.510> acts<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> spring<00:01:19.100> stretching

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
the crater acts like a spring stretching

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.630 
the crater acts like a spring stretching
out<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:21.409> surface<00:01:21.950> tension<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.460> water

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
out the surface tension of the water

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.750 
out the surface tension of the water
pulls<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.390> back<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.960> upwards<00:01:24.650> into<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.310> column

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
pulls it back and upwards into a column

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.590 
pulls it back and upwards into a column
or<00:01:25.909> jet<00:01:26.950> now<00:01:27.950> Jeff<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.580> Martin<00:01:28.790> prepare<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> pan

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
or jet now Jeff and Martin prepare a pan

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.050 
or jet now Jeff and Martin prepare a pan
with<00:01:29.630> water<00:01:29.840> only<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:30.979> sixteenth<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.909> an<00:01:32.030> inch

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
with water only one sixteenth of an inch

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.899 
with water only one sixteenth of an inch
deep<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.229> would<00:01:33.350> expect<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.040> crater<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.640> jet

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
deep you would expect the crater and jet

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.460 
deep you would expect the crater and jet
to<00:01:35.090> be<00:01:35.180> smaller<00:01:35.540> because<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.110> water<00:01:36.350> is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
to be smaller because the water is

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.750 
to be smaller because the water is
shallow

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
shallow

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760 
shallow
get<00:01:39.390> Lou<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.810> Jack<00:01:40.020> coming<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:40.590> not

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
get Lou go to Jack coming up but not

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
get Lou go to Jack coming up but not
near<00:01:41.010> so<00:01:41.040> much<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> deep<00:01:42.000> pool<00:01:42.240> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
near so much to the deep pool right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.180 
near so much to the deep pool right
because<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.290> has<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.530> dig<00:01:43.980> out<00:01:44.160> a

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
because it really has to dig out a

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.610 
because it really has to dig out a
crater<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.000> build<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.480> momentum<00:01:45.620> back<00:01:46.620> up

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
crater to build up the momentum back up

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.610 
crater to build up the momentum back up
now<00:01:49.620> let's<00:01:50.070> look<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> two<00:01:50.880> droplets

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
now let's look at the two droplets

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.550 
now let's look at the two droplets
side-by-side<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.940> energy<00:01:54.480> stored<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
side-by-side the energy stored when the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.340 
side-by-side the energy stored when the
droplet<00:01:55.950> falls<00:01:56.340> into<00:01:56.730> the<00:01:56.910> deep<00:01:57.120> pan<00:01:57.450> results

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
droplet falls into the deep pan results

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.290 
droplet falls into the deep pan results
in<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.620> higher<00:01:58.650> column

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.120 

advise<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> position<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.260> been<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
advise a position has been that it's the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
advise a position has been that it's the
that<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.760> energy<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.480> explosion<00:02:07.050> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that the energy of the explosion is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.810 
that the energy of the explosion is
going<00:02:07.380> outward<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.130> surface<00:02:08.460> tension

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
going outward that the surface tension

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.090 
going outward that the surface tension
is<00:02:09.270> stopping<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.410> sort<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> running

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
is stopping it and so sort of running

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.940 
is stopping it and so sort of running
into<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.430> rim<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> holding<00:02:12.330> place

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
into this rim that's holding place

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.050 
into this rim that's holding place
watching<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.130> two<00:02:14.250> waves<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.670> mean<00:02:14.910> it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
watching up in two waves I mean it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.940 
watching up in two waves I mean it's
worth<00:02:15.240> saying<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.900> why<00:02:16.260> these<00:02:16.320> corn

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
worth saying that that's why these corn

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.680 
worth saying that that's why these corn
nuts<00:02:17.130> happened<00:02:25.040> could<00:02:26.040> two<00:02:26.310> adults<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:27.180> more

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
nuts happened could two adults have more

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.550 
nuts happened could two adults have more
fun<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> drop<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> water<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:30.690> about<00:02:31.020> more

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
fun with a drop of water how about more

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.300 
fun with a drop of water how about more
color<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.450> blue<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.770> backside

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
color so we have blue on the backside

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.140 
color so we have blue on the backside
and<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.690> red<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.170> above<00:02:37.470> any<00:02:38.280> light<00:02:38.700> or

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
and the red will be above any light or

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.780 
and the red will be above any light or
any<00:02:39.450> flat<00:02:40.140> surface<00:02:40.440> horizontal<00:02:41.310> surface<00:02:41.670> of

any flat surface horizontal surface of
the<00:02:41.850> water<00:02:42.090> will<00:02:42.300> see<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> blue<00:02:42.750> yes<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the water will see the blue yes and the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
the water will see the blue yes and the
front<00:02:44.160> side<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.640> waves<00:02:44.940> would<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.270> seeing

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
front side of the waves would be seeing

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.350 
front side of the waves would be seeing
the<00:02:45.660> red<00:02:45.810> clearly<00:02:46.739> jeff<00:02:47.220> has<00:02:47.520> met<00:02:47.790> his<00:02:47.970> soul

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

floor

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.800 

oh<00:03:06.070> look<00:03:07.070> at<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.220> red<00:03:07.610> stand<00:03:08.000> out<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:08.510> helps

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
oh look at that red stand out that helps

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.110 
oh look at that red stand out that helps
much<00:03:09.500> yes

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.699 

oh<00:03:14.709> that's<00:03:15.709> beautiful<00:03:17.379> what's<00:03:18.379> flower

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
oh that's beautiful what's flower

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.920 
oh that's beautiful what's flower
pattern<00:03:19.190> yeah<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.819> red<00:03:20.000> standing<00:03:20.480> out<00:03:20.629> so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
pattern yeah in the red standing out so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.170 
pattern yeah in the red standing out so
well<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:22.040> really<00:03:22.250> helps<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.640> get<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.819> sense<00:03:23.090> of

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
well it really helps you get a sense of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.300 
well it really helps you get a sense of
depth<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.200> didn't<00:03:24.590> have<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.769> first<00:03:25.190> shot

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
depth that we didn't have a first shot

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.550 
depth that we didn't have a first shot
yeah<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:25.970> makes<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.330> really<00:03:26.690> standard

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.590 

that<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:31.010> drop<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.400> water

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
that is one drop of water

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.020 
that is one drop of water
and<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.200> all<00:03:33.320> pulls<00:03:33.590> back<00:03:33.830> up<00:03:34.100> right<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:34.880> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
and it all pulls back up right in the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.190 
and it all pulls back up right in the

thing<00:04:30.710> I've<00:04:30.830> been<00:04:30.919> looking<00:04:31.159> after<00:04:31.280> seven

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
thing I've been looking after seven

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.629 
thing I've been looking after seven
years<00:04:31.789> which<00:04:32.539> is<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.990> collision<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.039> splash

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
years which is a collision of the splash

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.210 
years which is a collision of the splash
with<00:04:35.479> another<00:04:35.750> drop<00:04:36.050> I've<00:04:36.530> never<00:04:36.740> seen<00:04:36.889> it<00:04:37.129> in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
with another drop I've never seen it in

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.450 
with another drop I've never seen it in
video<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.819> is<00:04:38.000> why<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.240> came<00:04:38.389> here<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.830> we<00:04:40.220> are

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
video this is why I came here and we are

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.070 
video this is why I came here and we are
determined<00:04:41.060> not<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.360> let<00:04:41.720> him<00:04:41.870> walk<00:04:42.020> away

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
determined not to let him walk away

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.399 
determined not to let him walk away
disappointed<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:44.150> we<00:04:44.240> have<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.509> very<00:04:44.780> constant

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
disappointed so we have a very constant

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.520 
disappointed so we have a very constant
rate<00:04:45.620> as<00:04:45.770> we<00:04:45.919> need<00:04:46.389> about<00:04:47.389> ten<00:04:47.750> drips<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.139> second

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
rate as we need about ten drips a second

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.969 
rate as we need about ten drips a second
exactly<00:04:49.449> about<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.810> bounce<00:04:51.050> exactly<00:04:51.620> now

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
exactly about that bounce exactly now

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.790 
exactly about that bounce exactly now
here<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.669> tricky<00:04:53.300> bit<00:04:53.479> these<00:04:54.470> two

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
here is the tricky bit these two

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040 
here is the tricky bit these two
geniuses<00:04:55.190> have<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.909> time<00:04:56.180> not<00:04:56.539> only<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
geniuses have to time not only the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.370 
geniuses have to time not only the
high-speed<00:04:57.590> camera<00:04:57.979> but<00:04:58.909> stage<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.599> three-part

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
high-speed camera but stage a three-part

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.749 
high-speed camera but stage a three-part
droplet<00:05:01.039> whole<00:05:02.030> new<00:05:02.210> tank<00:05:02.479> right<00:05:02.780> yep<00:05:03.490> first<00:05:04.490> a

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
droplet whole new tank right yep first a

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.409 
droplet whole new tank right yep first a
droplet<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.870> hits<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.409> water<00:05:06.880> then<00:05:07.880> the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
droplet that hits the water then the

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.890 
droplet that hits the water then the
droplet<00:05:08.870> bouncing<00:05:09.440> up<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:10.030> then<00:05:11.030> another

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
droplet bouncing up and then another

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.459 
droplet bouncing up and then another
drop<00:05:12.349> time<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.370> hit<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.969> bouncing<00:05:14.569> one<00:05:14.780> part

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
drop time to hit the bouncing one part

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.920 
drop time to hit the bouncing one part
of<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.620> trick<00:05:15.889> is<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.400> want<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.270> get<00:05:17.419> a<00:05:17.630> steady

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
of the trick is I want to get a steady

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.990 
of the trick is I want to get a steady
stream<00:05:18.199> of<00:05:18.289> drops<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> tenth<00:05:19.819> of<00:05:19.879> a

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
stream of drops about a tenth of a

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.330 
stream of drops about a tenth of a
second<00:05:20.270> apart<00:05:20.599> and<00:05:20.810> take<00:05:21.259> a<00:05:21.319> picture<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.770> just

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
second apart and take a picture of just

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.580 
second apart and take a picture of just
the<00:05:22.520> first<00:05:22.789> two<00:05:23.090> yeah<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:24.080> seems<00:05:24.259> like<00:05:24.440> an

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
the first two yeah this seems like an

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.320 
the first two yeah this seems like an
awful<00:05:25.009> lot<00:05:25.099> of<00:05:25.250> work<00:05:25.400> for<00:05:25.430> not<00:05:25.819> very<00:05:26.000> much<00:05:26.120> but

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
awful lot of work for not very much but

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.379 
awful lot of work for not very much but
if<00:05:27.229> you're<00:05:27.380> okay<00:05:27.680> with<00:05:27.710> this<00:05:27.889> let's<00:05:28.490> a<00:05:28.699> humor

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
if you're okay with this let's a humor

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.659 
if you're okay with this let's a humor
these<00:05:29.599> guys<00:05:29.840> well<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.860> doesn't<00:05:31.099> take<00:05:31.130> much<00:05:31.430> I

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
these guys well it doesn't take much I

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.550 
these guys well it doesn't take much I
raise<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.060> up<00:05:32.120> just<00:05:32.330> ever<00:05:32.569> so<00:05:32.840> slight<00:05:33.139> sway

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
raise it up just ever so slight sway

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.850 
raise it up just ever so slight sway
it's<00:05:33.889> way<00:05:34.039> too<00:05:34.099> fast

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
it's way too fast

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.200 
it's way too fast
ok<00:05:36.520> ready<00:05:36.759> go

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.710 

the<00:05:41.449> first<00:05:41.900> drive

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
the first drive

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
the first drive
coordinating<00:05:44.720> while<00:05:45.310> falls<00:05:46.310> back<00:05:50.740> despite

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
coordinating while falls back despite

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.740 
coordinating while falls back despite
comes<00:05:55.750> Wow<00:05:56.750> they<00:05:57.290> did<00:05:58.240> every<00:05:59.240> day<00:05:59.360> billions<00:05:59.630> of

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
comes Wow they did every day billions of

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.750 
comes Wow they did every day billions of
people<00:06:00.110> depend<00:06:00.920> on<00:06:01.010> water<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.370> live<00:06:01.520> they

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
people depend on water to live they

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.730 
people depend on water to live they
interact<00:06:02.120> with<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.330> it<00:06:02.720> rains<00:06:02.990> outside<00:06:03.290> and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
interact with it it rains outside and

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.110 
interact with it it rains outside and
there's<00:06:03.890> millions<00:06:04.340> of<00:06:04.550> drops<00:06:04.790> hitting<00:06:05.060> the

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
there's millions of drops hitting the

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.780 
there's millions of drops hitting the
ground<00:06:05.590> every<00:06:06.590> single<00:06:06.800> one<00:06:06.950> of<00:06:07.070> them<00:06:07.310> is<00:06:07.460> doing

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
ground every single one of them is doing

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.129 
ground every single one of them is doing
this

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.489 

and<00:06:15.139> I<00:06:15.830> think<00:06:16.069> no<00:06:16.430> one<00:06:16.639> really<00:06:17.110> gives<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.259> the

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:18.499 
and I think no one really gives that the

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.820 
and I think no one really gives that the
attention<00:06:18.919> that<00:06:18.949> it<00:06:19.159> deserves<00:06:20.680> that<00:06:21.680> is

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
attention that it deserves that is

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:34.480 
attention that it deserves that is
unreal

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.850 

okay<00:06:35.490> we're<00:06:35.789> idiots<00:06:36.000> we<00:06:36.750> thought<00:06:37.080> this<00:06:37.560> would

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
okay we're idiots we thought this would

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.120 
okay we're idiots we thought this would
be<00:06:37.889> boring<00:06:38.400> it<00:06:38.880> is<00:06:39.570> not<00:06:39.870> it<00:06:40.800> is<00:06:40.860> part<00:06:41.789> it<00:06:42.449> is

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
be boring it is not it is part it is

00:06:43.130 --> 00:07:04.410 
be boring it is not it is part it is
science<00:06:44.479> it<00:06:45.479> is<00:06:47.150> amazing

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.480
