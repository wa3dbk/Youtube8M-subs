both methods to do the loop method I'm

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.040 
both methods to do the loop method I'm
going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> take<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.390> section<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.840> rope

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
going to take your section of rope

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.980 
going to take your section of rope
double<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.980> back<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.310> itself<00:00:26.640> creating<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.689> long

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
two strand piece if you're going to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.510 
two strand piece if you're going to
treat<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.420> piece<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> rope<00:00:31.279> I'm<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
treat as one piece of rope I'm going to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
treat as one piece of rope I'm going to
take<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> end<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.480> double<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> back

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
take the end right here double it back

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.520 
take the end right here double it back
go<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> top<00:00:36.320> wrap<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> around

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
go over the top wrap it around

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
go over the top wrap it around
underneath<00:00:39.770> go<00:00:40.770> back<00:00:40.980> through<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> loop

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
underneath go back through this loop

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.630 
underneath go back through this loop
again<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:45.289> pulling<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> tight

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
again just like that pulling it tight

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.740 
again just like that pulling it tight
look<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.850> areas<00:00:48.030> where<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> rope<00:00:48.570> has

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
look for areas where the rope has

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.029 
look for areas where the rope has
crossed<00:00:49.020> itself<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.680> no<00:00:49.770> longer

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
crossed itself and it's no longer

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.270 
crossed itself and it's no longer
parallel<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.730> itself<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.860> are<00:00:52.980> areas

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
parallel to itself and these are areas

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.380 
parallel to itself and these are areas
where<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> knots<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.239> very

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
where the knots not going to be very

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
where the knots not going to be very
strong<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> manipulate<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
strong so you want to manipulate the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
strong so you want to manipulate the
knot<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.000> such<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.840> no

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
knot in such a way that there are no

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
knot in such a way that there are no
crosses<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.219> cross<00:00:59.520> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
crosses like here we have a cross it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
crosses like here we have a cross it
should<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.750> running<00:01:00.960> parallel<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.250> we'll<00:01:02.370> just

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
should be running parallel so we'll just

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.130 
should be running parallel so we'll just
keep<00:01:02.640> working<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.300> twisting<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
keep working it out twisting the not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
keep working it out twisting the not
till<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.799> parallel<00:01:06.590> here<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> nice

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
till it's parallel here we have a nice

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.810 
till it's parallel here we have a nice
clean<00:01:08.520> figure<00:01:09.210> eight<00:01:09.360> knot<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> loop<00:01:10.820> next

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
clean figure eight knot on a loop next

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.060 
clean figure eight knot on a loop next
we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> bite<00:01:12.630> method

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
we're going to go over the bite method

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.440 
we're going to go over the bite method
you<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.490> method<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you use this method when you need the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
you use this method when you need the
loop<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.140> around<00:01:16.380> something<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
loop to go around something that you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.230 
loop to go around something that you
wouldn't<00:01:17.189> normally<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.549> able<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> attach<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
wouldn't normally be able to attach it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.410 
wouldn't normally be able to attach it
to<00:01:18.360> using<00:01:19.549> start<00:01:20.549> off<00:01:20.700> we're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> leave

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to using start off we're going to leave

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
to using start off we're going to leave
our<00:01:21.450> rope<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.170> free<00:01:22.380> we're<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.680> to

our rope nice and free we're going to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
our rope nice and free we're going to
give<00:01:22.890> ourselves<00:01:23.009> plenty<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.729> room<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.630 
end for whatever we need to wrap this
around<00:01:27.170> we'll<00:01:28.170> come<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.829> we'll<00:01:29.040> pinch<00:01:29.490> a

around we'll come back and we'll pinch a
section<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> rope<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
section of rope down we're going to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730 
section of rope down we're going to
twist<00:01:32.009> once<00:01:32.369> creating<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.000> cross<00:01:33.740> twice

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
twist once creating one cross twice

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.060 
twist once creating one cross twice
creating<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.549> crosses<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.979> we're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
creating two crosses here and then we're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
creating two crosses here and then we're
going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.430> our<00:01:38.640> section<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> rope<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going to take our section of rope that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
going to take our section of rope that
we<00:01:40.049> left<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> run<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
we left out and we're going to run it in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.950 
we left out and we're going to run it in
towards<00:01:42.390> ourselves<00:01:44.390> loosely<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.780> knot

towards ourselves loosely the knot

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.440 
towards ourselves loosely the knot
should<00:01:46.170> look<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.710> this

we're going to wrap our other end of the
rope<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.430> object<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> to
