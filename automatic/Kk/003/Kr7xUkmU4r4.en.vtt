00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.719 
movement and so forth but you know grow
up<00:01:47.380> yeah<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.409> think<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.070> first<00:01:49.250> program<00:01:49.490> is

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
up yeah I think the first program is

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.520 
up yeah I think the first program is
very<00:01:49.939> competitive<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.509> very<00:01:50.720> explosive<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
very competitive and very explosive and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.070 
very competitive and very explosive and
I<00:01:51.799> think<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.640> swishing<00:01:53.090> has<00:01:53.299> might<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.930> his

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
I think that swishing has might have his

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.289 
I think that swishing has might have his
window<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.560> opportunity<00:01:55.190> because<00:01:55.790> he<00:01:56.090> has

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
window of opportunity because he has

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.830 
window of opportunity because he has
that<00:01:56.330> power<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.049> speed<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.729> but<00:01:58.729> um<00:01:58.939> winters

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that power and speed and but um winters

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.109 
that power and speed and but um winters

cam what are you going to do differently

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.850 
cam what are you going to do differently
because<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.989> know<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.230> last<00:02:51.410> training<00:02:51.620> camp

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
because I know that last training camp

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.729 
because I know that last training camp
was<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.160> hectic<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.579> everybody<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.600> was

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
was a bit hectic for everybody it was

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.630 
was a bit hectic for everybody it was
but<00:02:54.739> these<00:02:55.040> um<00:02:55.630> will<00:02:56.709> have<00:02:57.709> some<00:02:57.950> distractions

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
but these um will have some distractions

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.849 
but these um will have some distractions
in<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.239> one<00:02:59.420> else<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.750> guess<00:02:59.900> otherwise<00:03:00.709> it

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
in this one else I guess otherwise it

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.680 
in this one else I guess otherwise it
wouldn't<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:01.070> normal<00:03:01.519> so<00:03:01.730> these<00:03:02.150> what<00:03:02.510> what

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
wouldn't be normal so these what what

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.599 
wouldn't be normal so these what what
we're<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.049> do<00:03:03.109> is<00:03:03.260> we<00:03:03.410> undo<00:03:03.680> four<00:03:04.370> weeks

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
we're going to do is we undo four weeks

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.380 
we're going to do is we undo four weeks
in<00:03:05.290> baguio<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.769> four<00:03:07.040> weeks<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.489> la<00:03:07.790> instead<00:03:08.269> of

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
in baguio in four weeks in la instead of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.130 
in baguio in four weeks in la instead of
five<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.620> three<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.730> we'll<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:11.930> time

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
five and three so we'll have more time
