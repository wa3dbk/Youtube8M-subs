00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.459
 in short about this hello if you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.030
 interested in my opinion on mitsubishi green 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:14.009
 sea ​​then i will share it a little bit now and i 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.290
 long cars and grandis 2006 honestly 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050
 speaking at the wheel the machine feels just 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.200
 really enjoy the day i'm not 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.480
 I speak there about interior decoration to passersby 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.220
 I will continue about all affairs I do not speak about 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.830
 then how is it done? 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 done quite well here 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.030
 driving is very easy as soon as 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.160
 get behind the wheel of this car 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.850
 it turns out so straight cat simply 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.519
 instantly even in spite of the dimensions 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.359
 I say this for whatever reason I myself am going to 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.579
 audi a6 you know audi a6 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.609
 sandy frontier how do you get on like this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 the feeling that I have not traveled all the time 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.719
 on audi a6 on mitsubishi grandis that is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 after a ride on the verge of 10 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.999
 I have to get used to my car 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.020
 still a mountain like this day after 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:05.230
 after feeling from this car 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.490
 what can be said about insulation 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.260
 noise insulation here is but 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
 mediocre honestly nothing 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.690
 there is nothing special about the engine 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 crawled the engine will say so go on 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.910
 the car is very easy as it is very 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.500
 what and what if you don't eat first 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.260
 once on this car in the city will 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.430
 accurate pressing the gas pedal 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.500
 dosage here is just minimal 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 the car is already trying to break off then where 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.580
 5 liters worth of engine is not some 2 and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.060
 4 sound of the motor is also very pleasant 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.190
 about 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 this particular machine but this is hers 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.880
 salonchik principle 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.340
 dashboard 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.259
 Yes, I now very much that the case with 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.750
 right front I don't know i don't 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.140
 the owner of this car I do not know what but it seems 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.710
 on the fact that some significant leverage 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.060
 but Volodya such sound gives leverage in 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.140
 principle for a hundred and fifty 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.939
 one thousand kilometers and igor and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 the owner of this car does not know this 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.379
 nothing happened to her 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.209
 what can be said about the expense of 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.220
 about the expense of consumption in this car, too 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.519
 much less than the audi a6 in the city 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.730
 It turns out about 13 meters from 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.940
 13 to 15 liters of gas I think this is very 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.730
 good expense and principle there are you 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.049
 want a family car that will 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.640
 really like and will 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.530
 be good 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 tents that is pretty sporting 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.049
 tents this mitsubishi degrees 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.599
 appointed there is a lot on what minivans 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.940
 sharan it definitely disappears volkswagen 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.819
 sharan zero is not a competitor for 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.910
 boundaries and they repeat again this is not 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.129
 about the quality of how the car did finding 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.190
 year grandee made just superb 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.870
 honestly very neat very 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.700
 little advisers about 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.799
 soundproofing and even then did not finish out 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.349
 Wheels, we absolutely have everything there because 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.530
 again the same audi a6 2 5 series 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.379
 which I accounted for which I 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.540
 traveled a lot 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.569
 made some of your dough this grandis 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.780
 tax noisier 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.060
 noisier well, well, not so much noise, he and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.310
 order to give some discomfort from 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.769
 drive this car about 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.359
 spaciousness yes this car has seven 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.879
 places 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.189
 such are the places behind her on the last 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.250
 the place is now shown on the tire 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.439
 I have long been replacing tires about 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.420
 engine power susceptibility in 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.230
 Basically here is you give the gas and on the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.359
 the prince something goes about just immediately picks up 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.129
 thinks of nothing yes it was and grandis 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.790
 who tore me up during the start 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.849
 during a test drive to start about audi 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.609
 a6 my we did not start it on the border 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.230
 I just left unreal when I go 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.500
 driving is the border me feeling too 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.790
 then there is power she does not go anywhere 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.870
 that is, audi a6 feels really weaker 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.669
 results but only when 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.879
 Spun the engine probably Virkha 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.510
 Still, audi a6 works nicer than 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.709
 grandis 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.329
 but but this is not enough to 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.329
 audi a6 could go to the machine 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.780
 basically if you want everything 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.020
 roomy good family car and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.160
 so that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.730
 pretty sporting her could 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.190
 ride 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.040
 take this car it will not regret the power 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.300
 holy fingers to 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.210
 be deleted limiter on speed 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.730
 195 km hour that is , it works for me 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.010
 the defendant not knowing how machines 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.150
 biotech co filmed he gave way to settle on 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.940
 the border of which I did worked 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.890
 that is played before 195, and from then on all 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.840
 she doesn't rise I think you're not for 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.790
 power bill due to what it costs 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.410
 misfires because it became 5 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.770
 kilogram now he plays with full 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.479
 salon with thick salon decontaminate 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.169
 principle tell me more about 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.060
 this car is nothing 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.150
 if you have any questions then 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.150
 write try to answer them 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.330
 I will tell from the car even now after 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.410
 owning audi a6 really feel somehow 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.980
 a little bit noisier and yes and manageability she 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.530
 just puts a big fat plus on everything 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.640
 minuses 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.280
 minus the principle here are such customers 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.670
 if this quality workmanship 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.900
 have the cockpit of it all like a machine 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.990
 very reliable 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.300
 thanks for being with me 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.280
 I wish everyone good luck to report 30 possible 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.530
 someday i will release a review on this 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.930
 typewriter so this is my principle 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.780
 I will insert a big opinion and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.530
 fat plus all the disadvantages of this car 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.040
 I wish you all good luck on a little counter 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.040
 thank you for being with me 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.370
 and interrogate do not forget that the machine 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.630
 principle on repairs very very not 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.240
 Cheap how to say no and what's over 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.310
 expensive but it does not apply to cheap a 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.570
 be no cheaper than an audi a6 operating 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.570
 gone beware take
