closer<00:01:12.450> than<00:01:12.930> Deptford<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.640> let's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
closer than Deptford is so let's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.499 
closer than Deptford is so let's
hopefully<00:01:15.920> find<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:18.060> stuff<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
hopefully find it and do stuff like that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
hopefully find it and do stuff like that
so<00:01:18.840> yeah<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> weird<00:01:20.400> place<00:01:21.619> let's<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.770> see

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so yeah it's a weird place let's go see

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
so yeah it's a weird place let's go see
if<00:01:23.040> there's<00:01:23.220> anything<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.939> good<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> there

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
if there's anything really good in there

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
if there's anything really good in there
I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.560> gonna<00:01:25.680> take<00:01:25.830> me<00:01:25.979> long<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I think it's gonna take me long as I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
I think it's gonna take me long as I
don't<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.060> place<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
don't know the place and this is the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.039 
don't know the place and this is the
first<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:28.799> been<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.909> it's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
first one I've been to so it's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
first one I've been to so it's
I<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.280> find<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
I don't know if I'm gonna find it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
I don't know if I'm gonna find it
actually<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.869> mean<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.649> next<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually so I mean it's right next to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually so I mean it's right next to
the<00:01:34.979> mall<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:35.909> look<00:01:36.329> at

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the mall and I was just for one look at

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.710 
the mall and I was just for one look at
the<00:01:36.540> malls<00:01:36.720> over<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.939> we<00:01:38.939> shall<00:01:39.149> see<00:01:39.390> what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the malls over there we shall see what

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.320 
the malls over there we shall see what
happens<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.759> picked<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.180> my

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
happens all right so I picked up my

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.789 
happens all right so I picked up my
white<00:01:42.540> ranger<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> first<00:01:43.560> thing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
white ranger that was the first thing

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
white ranger that was the first thing
that<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.039> had<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> pick<00:01:44.580> up<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.330> want<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> look

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that I had to pick up and I want to look

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.649 
that I had to pick up and I want to look
around<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:47.240> all<00:01:48.240> these<00:01:48.509> figures

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
around what they had all these figures

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.130 
around what they had all these figures
they<00:01:48.869> had<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.560> ultra<00:01:50.039> mode<00:01:50.250> figures

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
they had all the ultra mode figures

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
they had all the ultra mode figures
nonmetallic<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.640> regular<00:01:54.210> case

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
nonmetallic so this is the regular case

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.899 
nonmetallic so this is the regular case
the<00:01:54.869> non<00:01:55.080> Cheney<00:01:55.439> ones<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.399> they're<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.640> four
