i'm<00:00:15.070> going<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.340> use<00:00:15.490> expanders<00:00:16.299> with<00:00:17.080> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
i'm going to use expanders with the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.950 
i'm going to use expanders with the
groundbait<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:19.240> this<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.480> how<00:00:19.570> we<00:00:19.750> prepare

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
groundbait but this is how we prepare

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.439 
groundbait but this is how we prepare
the<00:00:20.170> pellets<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:21.010> expanders<00:00:21.580> they<00:00:22.090> come<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.390> a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
the pellets the expanders they come in a

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:35.130 
the pellets the expanders they come in a
dry<00:00:22.900> form<00:00:23.349> in<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.680> packet<00:00:25.770> all<00:00:26.770> you<00:00:26.919> do<00:00:34.140> I'm

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
dry form in the packet all you do I'm

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.420 
dry form in the packet all you do I'm
probably<00:00:35.260> going<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.680> fifty<00:00:35.920> three<00:00:36.160> or<00:00:36.250> four

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
probably going to fifty three or four

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.220 
probably going to fifty three or four
hours<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.790> day<00:00:36.910> I<00:00:37.059> should<00:00:37.239> be<00:00:37.480> feeding<00:00:37.719> these<00:00:38.020> as

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
hours a day I should be feeding these as

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.959 
hours a day I should be feeding these as
well<00:00:38.260> as<00:00:38.559> using<00:00:38.829> them<00:00:39.100> on<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.340> hook<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:39.730> I

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
well as using them on the hook so I

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.780 
well as using them on the hook so I
would<00:00:40.960> probably<00:00:41.140> say<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.829> I<00:00:42.040> don't<00:00:42.460> know<00:00:42.520> a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
would probably say that I don't know a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.180 
would probably say that I don't know a
pint<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.420> more<00:00:43.719> than<00:00:43.870> enough<00:00:44.170> of<00:00:46.649> expander<00:00:47.649> all

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
pint is more than enough of expander all

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.979 
pint is more than enough of expander all
all<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.760> do<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:48.940> just<00:00:49.210> simply<00:00:49.449> put<00:00:49.690> them<00:00:49.809> into

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
all you do is just simply put them into

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.290 
all you do is just simply put them into
a<00:00:50.140> into<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:52.170> pellet<00:00:53.170> pump<00:00:53.379> add<00:00:54.100> light<00:00:54.699> water<00:00:54.969> to

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
a into a pellet pump add light water to

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.029 
a into a pellet pump add light water to
it<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.800> submerge<00:00:57.730> them<00:00:58.030> into<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.420> pump<00:00:59.039> make

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
it just submerge them into the pump make

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.990 
it just submerge them into the pump make
sure<00:01:00.069> they've<00:01:00.460> all<00:01:00.609> all<00:01:01.149> submerged<00:01:06.000> simply

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
sure they've all all submerged simply

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:19.649 
sure they've all all submerged simply
add<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> lid<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> it<00:01:17.939> normally<00:01:18.939> takes<00:01:19.180> once<00:01:19.450> or

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
add the lid to it normally takes once or

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.450 
add the lid to it normally takes once or
twice<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.140> drop<00:01:20.350> them<00:01:20.590> these<00:01:20.860> are<00:01:21.040> six<00:01:21.250> mil

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
twice to drop them these are six mil

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.370 
twice to drop them these are six mil
pellets<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:21.969> they're<00:01:22.719> obviously<00:01:23.049> there's<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
pellets so they're obviously there's a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:31.069 
pellets so they're obviously there's a
lot<00:01:23.409> more<00:01:23.560> air<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.219> these<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.670> couple<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.360> times

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.560 

little<00:01:32.079> shake

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
little shake

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.860 
little shake
and<00:01:34.080> they've<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.320> gone<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
and they've all gone down now now I

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.450 
and they've all gone down now now I
leave<00:01:37.050> those<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.470> soak<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.100> their<00:01:38.280> licks

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
leave those to soak in their their licks

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
leave those to soak in their their licks
they'll<00:01:38.700> keep<00:01:38.880> expanding<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.840> won't<00:01:40.229> take<00:01:40.440> them

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
they'll keep expanding I won't take them

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
they'll keep expanding I won't take them
out<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> water<00:01:41.070> until<00:01:41.580> sort<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.940> 10<00:01:42.090> minutes

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
out the water until sort of 10 minutes

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
out the water until sort of 10 minutes
before<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.990> actually<00:01:43.620> want<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.010> use<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.460> there

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
before I actually want to use them there

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
before I actually want to use them there
there<00:01:46.140> are<00:01:46.229> six<00:01:46.440> mil<00:01:46.650> at<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> moment<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
there are six mil at the moment and I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270 
there are six mil at the moment and I
want<00:01:47.760> them<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:47.940> expand<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.500> possibly<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.100> eight

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
want them to expand to possibly an eight

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.969 
want them to expand to possibly an eight
mil<00:01:50.580> even<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:52.080> them<00:01:52.320> when

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mil even so I like to use them when

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.760 
mil even so I like to use them when
they're<00:01:53.160> them<00:01:53.460> their<00:01:53.880> maximum<00:01:54.540> size<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're them their maximum size so I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
they're them their maximum size so I
should<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.009> leave<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
should just leave them in that in that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 
should just leave them in that in that
container<00:01:57.750> until<00:01:57.990> I've<00:01:58.350> finished<00:01:58.890> preparing

the all the excess water just simply
drained<00:03:30.930> off<00:03:31.140> them

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.520 

there's<00:03:42.180> enough<00:03:42.450> water<00:03:42.719> on<00:03:42.959> these<00:03:43.139> pellets

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
there's enough water on these pellets

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.319 
there's enough water on these pellets
now<00:03:43.739> they'll<00:03:43.980> keep<00:03:44.280> absorbing<00:03:44.730> what's<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
now they'll keep absorbing what's in

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.300 
now they'll keep absorbing what's in
there<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.599> after<00:03:45.689> 10<00:03:46.049> minutes<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.099> you'll

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
there and after 10 minutes or so you'll

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.160 
there and after 10 minutes or so you'll
find<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.730> there<00:03:47.939> they'll<00:03:48.299> clog<00:03:48.599> up<00:03:48.810> slightly

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
find that there they'll clog up slightly

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.839 
find that there they'll clog up slightly
together<00:03:49.680> they'll<00:03:49.889> want<00:03:50.159> to<00:03:50.340> stick<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.760> each
