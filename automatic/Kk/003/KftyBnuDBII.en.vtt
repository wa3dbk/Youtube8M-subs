00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.860
 how does it work 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 computer irreplaceable components 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 human society 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 he handles the pictures of the sounds of the numbers 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.059
 words fortunately all the information you can 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.619
 save not to lose when 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.330
 computer shut down task hard 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 disk inside the computer save and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 issue information than fast hard 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.230
 drive amazing inventions 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.430
 computer industry he can store 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.430
 astronomical amount of information 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.750
 this miniature device records 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.370
 almost unlimited 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.370
 information I use the laws of physics and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.200
 so how does he do it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.200
 to understand you need to break 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.990
 The hard disk consists of five main 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.220
 parts 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 integrated circuit synchronizes 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.080
 the disk drive with the computer controls 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.229
 electromotor rotating by all processes 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.119
 disk approximately 7200 1 minute integral 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 circuits maintain speed constantly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.409
 now the most important part of the rocker 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 which writes and reads 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.049
 information 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.399
 rocker end divided to work 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.789
 immediately with a few low but head 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.020
 yoke never touch the disk 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 the gap between the surface of the disk and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.149
 head is 5000 times smaller than 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.740
 human hair 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.429
 the knob draws air that accelerates 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.750
 rotating disk protect yourself to 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.679
 necessary if we want to use 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.259
 this device for years and what can 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.039
 be damage to the damage of the disc it 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.619
 no metaphor such thin layers weight 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.369
 heads equal to weight 747 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.770
 aircraft and weight 747 aircraft comparable 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.140
 with a weight of 100 thousand passengers flying on 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.670
 speeds of 100 kilometers per hour deviation 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 in fractions of millimeters cry all 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.960
 friction force is also important 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.260
 when the beam starts to read 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.460
 information shifting to 60 1 second 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.780
 the engine rocker is not wedding because 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.760
 what is the electromagnetic system 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.800
 works on the interaction of two forces 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 nature of electricity and magnetism 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:42.620
 such interaction to accelerate the rocker 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.690
 q speeds light before this was about 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 components now talk about storage 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.900
 before 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.420
 data is stored in narrow tracks on 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.610
 disc surface during production at 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.190
 the disk creates more than 200 thousand such 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.180
 tracks each track is divided into 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.800
 map sectors are more expensive to sector and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.630
 allow heads to determine where 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.630
 write down or where to read information 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.459
 disk surface is smooth and shiny but 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.700
 closer look at the structure 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 turns out to be harder fer magnetic film 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.760
 remembers all the information on the surface 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.709
 head magnetizes microscopic 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.200
 area on the film setting magnetic 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.830
 the moment of such a cell is 1 state 0 or 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.620
 unit 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.550
 each such zero and one are called 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.500
 bits value corresponds to a bit 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.600
 orientation of the magnetic field plus and 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.850
 minus and don't worry 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.920
 data integrity photo good 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.190
 qualities take about 29 million 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.549
 of these cells and scattered across 12 different 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.549
 sectors 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.260
 sounds impressive but in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.000
 reality is so incredible 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.010
 the number of bits takes very 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 small area on the surface of the disk 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.340
 every square centimeter of surface 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.340
 including you 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:08.940
 31 billion bits that's what I understand 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.500
 memory hard drive writes and issues 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.690
 information at speeds which is difficult 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.430
 submit using the law of magnetism 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.799
 thin film disc can remember 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.820
 many different encyclopedias or hundreds 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.210
 thousand photos 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.860
 easy hard drive actually amazing 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.480
 or miniature recording device 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.480
 any information in the little bits 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.870
 this engineering masterpiece expands 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.870
 scope of intelligent physics bit by bit
