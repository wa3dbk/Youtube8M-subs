00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
using the battery camera constantly

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
using the battery camera constantly
taking<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.099> vacation<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.030> two

taking on vacation have one or two
charges<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> you'll<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.900> fine<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.379> then

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
charges and you'll be fine and then

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.839 
also on this lens you have a stabilizer
now<00:02:16.680> what<00:02:16.800> if<00:02:16.860> stabilizer<00:02:17.250> does<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.700> when

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
now what if stabilizer does is when

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.550 
now what if stabilizer does is when
you're<00:02:18.000> using<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.330> low<00:02:18.480> shutter<00:02:18.690> speed<00:02:19.020> it'll

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you're using a low shutter speed it'll

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.260 
you're using a low shutter speed it'll
actually<00:02:19.739> still<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> crisp<00:02:20.849> image

actually still get you a crisp image

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.720 
actually still get you a crisp image
it'll<00:02:21.450> give<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.630> about<00:02:21.750> two<00:02:22.050> stops<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.730> leeway

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it'll give you about two stops of leeway

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.580 
it'll give you about two stops of leeway
and<00:02:23.819> that'll<00:02:24.030> let<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.569> get<00:02:24.750> kind<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.050> you're

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
and that'll let you get kind of you're

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
shaking the camera getting a blurry

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.860 
shaking the camera getting a blurry
image<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.360> help<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> stabilize

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
that you can also switch it over to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.880 
that you can also switch it over to
manual<00:02:30.420> focus<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.590> other<00:02:31.680> thing<00:02:31.800> that's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
manual focus now the other thing that's

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.520 
manual focus now the other thing that's
important<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> note<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
important to note on this is that it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.650 
important to note on this is that it
takes<00:02:34.770> SD<00:02:35.040> cards<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.090> using<00:02:36.360> your<00:02:36.480> more

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660

standard meet it's not using compact
flash<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:38.610> are<00:02:38.700> more<00:02:38.790> expensive<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and the greatest they're very fast

and the greatest they're very fast
they're<00:02:55.140> very<00:02:55.470> high<00:02:55.650> capacities<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.280> you're

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
they're very high capacities and you're

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.520 
they're very high capacities and you're
going<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.580> need<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.239> an

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
going to need that because this is an

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.680 
going to need that because this is an
18-megapixel<00:02:58.580> CMOS<00:02:59.580> sensor<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> can't

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
18-megapixel CMOS sensor so you can't

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.610 
18-megapixel CMOS sensor so you can't
see<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:00.989> there<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.319> behind<00:03:01.410> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
see it in there but right behind that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.920 
see it in there but right behind that
mirror<00:03:01.799> there's<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.310> very<00:03:02.670> large<00:03:03.030> Center<00:03:03.569> in<00:03:03.660> 18

mirror there's a very large Center in 18
megapixel<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> produce<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.950> huge

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
megapixel is going to produce a huge

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
again if you don't know what raw is and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
saying you will learn is to use this but

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
the ability to shoot in raw that's going

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.259 
the ability to shoot in raw that's going
to<00:03:16.530> give<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> lot<00:03:17.069> of<00:03:17.190> latitude<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.790> posts

to give you a lot of latitude in posts

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.759 
to give you a lot of latitude in posts
when<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.450> put<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.840> your<00:03:18.870> computer<00:03:19.320> you

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
when you put this in your computer you

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.020 
when you put this in your computer you
have<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.920> lot<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.190> great<00:03:20.430> things<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.880> do

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
have a lot of great things you can do

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.460 
have a lot of great things you can do
with<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.329> another<00:03:22.140> thing<00:03:22.290> that's<00:03:22.410> really

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
with it another thing that's really

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.860 
with it another thing that's really
great<00:03:22.709> about<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:23.070> be<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.370> beyond<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
great about this be up beyond the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
great about this be up beyond the
articulating<00:03:24.870> screen<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.350> video<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
articulating screen for video is the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
articulating screen for video is the
fact<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.790> has<00:03:26.940> manual<00:03:27.329> audio<00:03:27.840> controls

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
fact that it has manual audio controls

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.630 
fact that it has manual audio controls
so<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> problem<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.160> taking<00:03:29.370> videos

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
so one of the problem is taking videos

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
so one of the problem is taking videos
on<00:03:29.730> these<00:03:29.850> before<00:03:30.180> was<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.359> they<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
on these before was that they have

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.960 
on these before was that they have
automatic<00:03:31.530> gain<00:03:31.680> control<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.190> that's<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.609> big

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
automatic gain control and that's a big

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.140 
automatic gain control and that's a big
no-no<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.810> makes<00:03:34.170> your<00:03:34.290> sound<00:03:34.650> very<00:03:35.579> noisy<00:03:36.060> and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
no-no it makes your sound very noisy and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.610 
no-no it makes your sound very noisy and
very<00:03:36.359> loud<00:03:36.540> especially<00:03:36.690> when<00:03:37.019> it's<00:03:37.109> quiet<00:03:37.260> now

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
very loud especially when it's quiet now

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.110 
very loud especially when it's quiet now
you<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:38.070> manual<00:03:38.489> levels<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> can

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
you have manual levels and you can

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.090 
you have manual levels and you can
adjust<00:03:39.239> them<00:03:39.600> independently<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.890> when<00:03:40.980> you're

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
adjust them independently so when you're

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220 
adjust them independently so when you're
shooting<00:03:41.220> full<00:03:41.489> 1080p<00:03:41.880> video<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.989> kind<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
shooting full 1080p video you kind of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.199 
shooting full 1080p video you kind of
come<00:03:43.440> over<00:03:43.709> here<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.730> plug<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.090> your

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
come over here you plug in your

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.060 
come over here you plug in your
microphone<00:03:45.720> actually<00:03:46.320> over<00:03:46.530> here<00:03:46.680> plug<00:03:46.980> in

control that level or manually control
that<00:03:52.920> level<00:03:53.160> which<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.400> actually<00:03:53.579> much<00:03:54.000> better

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
that level which is actually much better

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.420 
that level which is actually much better
