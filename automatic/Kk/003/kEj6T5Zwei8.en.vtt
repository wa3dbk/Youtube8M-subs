market right now for mobile phones which

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.630 
market right now for mobile phones which
is<00:00:12.420> iOS<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.849> webos<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.509> latest<00:00:15.900> version<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
is iOS for webos the latest version and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.700 
is iOS for webos the latest version and
android<00:00:17.640> 2.1<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.960> froyo<00:00:19.470> was

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
android 2.1 now I know that froyo was

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.130 
android 2.1 now I know that froyo was
out<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.039> unfortunately<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.869> only<00:00:21.930> be

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
out but unfortunately that can only be

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
out but unfortunately that can only be
gotten<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.090> nexus<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:25.640> unless<00:00:26.640> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
gotten through the nexus one unless you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
gotten through the nexus one unless you
root<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> phone<00:00:27.449> which<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.840> obviously<00:00:27.960> have

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
root the phone which I obviously have

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
root the phone which I obviously have
not<00:00:28.769> done<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> droid<00:00:29.369> x<00:00:29.689> since<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
not done with the droid x since it is a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.830 
not done with the droid x since it is a
test<00:00:31.289> unit<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
test unit so what I'm going to do it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
test unit so what I'm going to do it
really<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.320> instead<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> comparing<00:00:35.190> all<00:00:36.000> these

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
really is instead of comparing all these

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.560 
really is instead of comparing all these
operating<00:00:36.930> systems<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.680> every<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.129> possible

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
operating systems in every way possible

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
operating systems in every way possible
I'm<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.960> over<00:00:40.640> multitasking<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
I'm going to go over multitasking on the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'm going to go over multitasking on the
three<00:00:42.180> operating<00:00:42.660> systems<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.180> my

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
three operating systems if you want my

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.069 
three operating systems if you want my
opinion<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> best

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
opinion on which one is the best

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.090 
opinion on which one is the best
unfortunately<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> can't<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.680> give<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
unfortunately I can't really give that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
unfortunately I can't really give that
opinion<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.940> however<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.840> give<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
opinion to you however I can give you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
opinion to you however I can give you
some<00:00:52.670> characteristics<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
some characteristics and so I'm going to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.069 
some characteristics and so I'm going to
give<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.670> generalizations<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
give you generalizations of all the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.939 
give you generalizations of all the
operating<00:00:58.649> systems<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.280> terms<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.760> overall

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
operating systems in terms of overall

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
operating systems in terms of overall
what<00:01:01.949> you'd<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.309> getting<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.690> on

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
what you'd be getting from them so on

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
what you'd be getting from them so on
right<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
right now I have basically you know the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
right now I have basically you know the
three<00:01:07.200> main<00:01:07.710> devices<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.580> each<00:01:08.670> operating

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
three main devices for each operating

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.080 
three main devices for each operating
system<00:01:09.720> certainly<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> iphone<00:01:11.159> 4<00:01:11.490> palm<00:01:11.790> pre

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
system certainly the iphone 4 palm pre

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
system certainly the iphone 4 palm pre
plus<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> two<00:01:12.900> best<00:01:13.200> phones<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
plus are the two best phones for the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.149 
plus are the two best phones for the
operating<00:01:14.460> system<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.780> droid<00:01:16.080> x<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.530> arguably

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
operating system the droid x is arguably

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.740 
operating system the droid x is arguably
the<00:01:17.340> best<00:01:17.490> android<00:01:17.939> phone<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.540> now

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the best android phone right now

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.980 
the best android phone right now
although<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.070> evo<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:20.790> close<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
although the evo was very close and that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
although the evo was very close and that
can<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.380> either<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.729> point<00:01:24.000> being

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
can go either way but the point being

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050 
can go either way but the point being
that<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.720> basically<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> three<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.640> phones

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that it's basically the three top phones

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.370 
that it's basically the three top phones
for<00:01:27.570> their<00:01:27.780> operating<00:01:28.259> systems<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> let's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
for their operating systems so let's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
for their operating systems so let's
let's<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:34.549> turn<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:35.880> on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
let's go with them turn all these on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
let's go with them turn all these on
right<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:39.650> alright<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.829> let's<00:01:41.009> discuss

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
right now alright so let's discuss

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.700 
right now alright so let's discuss
really<00:01:42.350> which<00:01:43.729> operating<00:01:44.729> system<00:01:45.710> handles

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
really which operating system handles

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
really which operating system handles
multitasking<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> best<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.479> unfortunately

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
multitasking the best so unfortunately

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.139 
multitasking the best so unfortunately
i'm<00:01:51.899> trying<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.320> these<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.100> unlock<00:01:54.030> at

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
i'm trying to get these all to unlock at

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
i'm trying to get these all to unlock at
the<00:01:54.240> same<00:01:54.450> time<00:01:55.579> okay<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.640> uh<00:01:57.680> multitasking<00:01:58.680> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the same time okay so uh multitasking on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
the same time okay so uh multitasking on
webos<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.880> basically<00:02:00.329> where<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.810> open

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
webos is basically where you just open

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.069 
webos is basically where you just open
up<00:02:01.200> applications<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
up applications and then you have a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
up applications and then you have a
gesture<00:02:04.649> area<00:02:04.890> at<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> bottom<00:02:05.369> which<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
gesture area at the bottom which you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
gesture area at the bottom which you
press<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.740> open<00:02:08.429> up

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
press and then you go and open up

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390 
press and then you go and open up
another<00:02:09.599> application<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.560> home<00:02:10.800> menu<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
another application in the home menu so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.120 
another application in the home menu so
i<00:02:11.430> opened<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
i opened up the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.270 
i opened up the
browser<00:02:12.540> let's<00:02:13.540> open<00:02:13.810> up<00:02:13.900> Fandango<00:02:15.300> or

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
browser let's open up Fandango or

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.390 
browser let's open up Fandango or
whatever<00:02:18.280> application<00:02:18.490> i<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.150> opened<00:02:20.400> so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
whatever application i just opened so

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.660

interface with the deck of cards and you
can<00:03:47.650> see<00:03:47.860> everything<00:03:48.520> that's<00:03:48.820> going<00:03:49.030> at<00:03:49.780> once

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
can see everything that's going at once

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.380 
can see everything that's going at once
however<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.160> not<00:03:51.250> obtrusive<00:03:51.790> it's<00:03:52.209> not

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
however it's not obtrusive it's not

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.620 
however it's not obtrusive it's not
disruptive<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.400> very<00:03:54.730> very<00:03:55.000> cool<00:03:55.360> way<00:03:55.600> to

disruptive it's a very very cool way to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.510 
disruptive it's a very very cool way to
get<00:03:56.140> rid<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.350> applications<00:03:57.130> you'll<00:03:57.310> just

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
get rid of applications you'll just

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.390 
get rid of applications you'll just
flick<00:03:58.480> them<00:03:58.690> off<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.140> screen<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.740> you<00:04:00.280> can

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
flick them off the screen and you can

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.110 
flick them off the screen and you can
resize<00:04:00.820> them<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:02.160> think<00:04:03.160> that's<00:04:03.340> where<00:04:03.550> webos

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
resize them I think that's where webos

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.360 
resize them I think that's where webos
has<00:04:04.480> really<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.350> major<00:04:06.340> strong<00:04:06.910> point<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.980> now

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
has really a major strong point so now

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.730 
has really a major strong point so now
that<00:04:09.400> I've<00:04:09.760> covered<00:04:10.320> multitasking<00:04:11.320> last

argue with me that interfering with
Android<00:05:23.790> in<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:24.000> way<00:05:24.150> or<00:05:24.450> adding<00:05:25.320> things<00:05:25.560> to

Android in a way or adding things to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920 
Android in a way or adding things to
Android<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.580> not<00:05:26.700> necessarily<00:05:27.330> tinkering

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
Android it's not necessarily tinkering

Android it's not necessarily tinkering
with<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:29.100> they're<00:05:29.370> right<00:05:29.580> in<00:05:29.790> that<00:05:29.910> aspect

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
with it and they're right in that aspect

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.020 
with it and they're right in that aspect
but<00:05:30.810> uh<00:05:31.010> some<00:05:32.010> consumers<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.640> want<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.850> very

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
but uh some consumers just want a very

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.020 
but uh some consumers just want a very
simple<00:05:33.510> approach<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> smartphone<00:05:35.700> and

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
simple approach to a smartphone and

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.860 
simple approach to a smartphone and
that's<00:05:36.210> really<00:05:36.420> what<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.780> iphone<00:05:37.200> is<00:05:38.870> webOS

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
that's really what the iphone is webOS

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.140 
that's really what the iphone is webOS
is<00:05:40.200> almost<00:05:40.800> like<00:05:40.980> a<00:05:41.040> mix<00:05:41.370> between<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.940> two

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
is almost like a mix between the two

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.100 
is almost like a mix between the two
because<00:05:42.780> webOS<00:05:43.440> has<00:05:43.880> fantastic<00:05:45.110> multitasking

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
because webOS has fantastic multitasking

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.590 
because webOS has fantastic multitasking
is<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.320> very<00:05:46.770> powerful<00:05:47.070> operating<00:05:47.940> system<00:05:48.390> um

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
is a very powerful operating system um

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.400 
is a very powerful operating system um
you<00:05:49.590> could<00:05:49.920> possibly<00:05:50.510> customize<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:51.840> now<00:05:52.140> some

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
you could possibly customize it now some

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.500 
you could possibly customize it now some
may<00:05:52.560> argue<00:05:52.590> with<00:05:53.190> me<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.670> all<00:05:53.880> three<00:05:54.360> devices

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
may argue with me that all three devices

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.840 
may argue with me that all three devices
can<00:05:55.140> possibly<00:05:55.650> be<00:05:55.950> um<00:05:56.990> changed<00:05:58.100> now<00:05:59.100> Android

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
can possibly be um changed now Android

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.400 
can possibly be um changed now Android
that<00:06:00.120> can<00:06:00.300> be<00:06:00.360> done<00:06:00.570> through<00:06:00.600> rooting<00:06:01.260> your

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
that can be done through rooting your

that can be done through rooting your
device<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:02.610> iphone<00:06:03.030> can<00:06:03.180> be<00:06:03.270> jailbroken<00:06:03.980> and

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
device the iphone can be jailbroken and

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.090 
device the iphone can be jailbroken and
webos<00:06:05.760> can<00:06:06.270> be<00:06:06.450> changed<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.650> homebrew

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
webos can be changed to the homebrew

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.330 
webos can be changed to the homebrew
community<00:06:08.870> but<00:06:09.870> webOS<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.560> me<00:06:10.710> is<00:06:10.830> still<00:06:10.950> very

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
community but webOS to me is still very

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.070 
community but webOS to me is still very
really<00:06:12.330> really<00:06:12.630> good<00:06:12.780> platform<00:06:13.410> its<00:06:14.340> absolute

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
really really good platform its absolute

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.660 
really really good platform its absolute

two<00:06:18.320> however<00:06:19.320> it<00:06:19.800> does<00:06:20.160> have<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.400> pretty<00:06:20.790> decent
