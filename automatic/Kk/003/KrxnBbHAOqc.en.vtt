00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:15.880
 Yes I wish everyone a nice day 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:17.330
 It is eh this time I would like to introduce the app called app explosion-speed four-wheel drive of Taiwan of four wheel drive mini 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.220
 I will 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:27.430
 It's this app, but it was just released to gestures in January 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.490
 Basically it is a mini back racing simulation game 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.840
 When in is called what can be simulated up 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:41.020
 It's It is this game and what number of cases screen physics engine is piled up 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.800
 So it's really like going out of course, so it's acceleration that 's right or something else 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 It is said that it has been reproduced quite realistically 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.550
 Yeah It's First 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:56.989
 Remodeling It is still a state of game progress to this extent, but my machine is 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:03.949
 It is a place that can be remodeled A little remodeling will introduce the life 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.399
 It is a motor first It is the top left corner first You can wash the motor by yourself 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.320
 When 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:11.970
 dat 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 It is a tire or rollerless or it's a wing or something else , too. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.510
 Well one is that you can create your ideal machine in combination with it is like parts 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 Users had become One of Uri 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.050
 It's here when you want to get a new one. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.180
 You pull parts 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:34.650
 You can develop the machine of that gacha 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.620
 It is like a this have developed and are referred to as either Well do Mase what can be developed in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.550
 I'm from a machine I do not know well 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.640
 It is a little from Naa specific machine on which it was seen somewhere say you Deko 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.940
 What it is from the machine I word of this flimsy doctor 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.730
 This Cyclone Magnum I have seen when I go a little more 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.290
 And air peak spider 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.680
 It is a Neo Tri-dagger gmc I is written Te This wind is also not emc 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.100
 It looks like 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.790
 Well battering brother Let's &amp; Came out 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.350
 It's said that a brand new can be used in various ways 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.030
 Well, because it is not apart from this official app 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 I don't know summer or what it is like 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.860
 Well, though it is here a 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:28.599
 Do s consume this Kedomo I think that sleeping upper left it is or become Futami 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.970
 Well to charge doing this in I will cut off the battery in the lower left of You're value is less the way of this battery 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.989
 And that is the right side 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.430
 There is a red gauge, but this is a mechanic gauge. This is a 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.600
 I've got 2 lessons 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.450
 And it will no longer work 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.610
 Though it is a race 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.440
 Hey ! 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.700
 If I have this with the race children and guidance , I would like to take a lead action Naisin 8 this time 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.390
 But 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.270
 I hear 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.430
 To race in the course of say kana Jai and the current ones Tteyuu guess front public relations you here. 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.190
 I would like 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:08.520
 In what is what you can operate during the race 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.790
 During the race, you can adjust the rate of rotation of the machine's speed motor and after that 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.160
 Easy to receive cut rice magnum boost 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.510
 can 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.620
 At the beginning of the voice corner turn right now it is round right 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 And this speed adjustment but I think that became smaller it is balance look 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.770
 I do not like going out of course 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.910
 It is possible to adjust 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.720
 Now though I'm in the way Come on doing this Well actually this 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.250
 If you don't make speedy adjustments, you're going to concert more and more 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.250
 It is a difficult part of Sega guidance 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.110
 I'm going to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.030
 Well though I was pushing the now the left side of the button to it is press this button speed 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.720
 If you understand the booth 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.430
 So I think this is a little red now 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.879
 The red state is now in the state of speed 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.879
 Yeah Well 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.290
 After it is and the time of use of the boost the right-hand side of a 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.260
 It is time to use the engine 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.950
 While talking about the engine or making adjustments well 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.269
 It became a game to play 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.130
 It is a small child thing, but I do not have to operate the engine 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:27.360
 This time it's a little bit fun The answer is flying straight away with your opponent 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:31.439
 The engine is also operated as a child. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.960
 In this game a I mentioned earlier, but I am loaded with Buddha 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:37.370
 Because 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.360
 I'm going into a course that's kind of kinda kind of thing or something like that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.360
 It has got basically become a treat to say If you do not run their own course and glory third 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.360
 Well, if this course takes 84 laps 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.659
 Well that's great but it's fine that 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.430
 It is either a or put many within that you are Come on do this turn of opponent 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:05:03.110
 In particular, it is quite hot to say that I'm tired and tired many times in the final stage 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.289
 Because there are elements that 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.999
 Ne 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.999
 I think I can enjoy it 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.610
 It's time when it's too late to move forward 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.750
 There is a place that stops in front of uphill and it does not move, but there is 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.860
 Well I wonder if you can not do it as detailed as Japanese apps 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.490
 It is with this if you end the race I'd bought this time I race road 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.520
 The reward is the same as the room Japanese social game. 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.240
 If you come this way, sometimes you can get a coin 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.199
 If you say that it is good to be protected like a roller 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.300
 Although the time's kinda rare is the phlegm into the hand 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:44.190
 The item I got this way is this 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.960
 This is I Tan Te Agaya' in the green of a child a little When you become integrated this time from the remodeling screen 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.040
 Though 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.420
 I'll equip this guy 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.410
 Well this is a game where you remodel your machine and say and play 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.270
 By all means even though there are black and a little a Mr. does not Otose only from the Taiwan market 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.880
 Please play with everyone 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.880
 Well, thank you for watching this time.
