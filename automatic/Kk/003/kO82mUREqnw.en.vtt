on the top so you can even do it here if
you<00:01:02.219> want<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:03.379> they<00:01:04.379> left<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> top<00:01:05.100> now

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and some people did not like the idea

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
and some people did not like the idea
but<00:01:09.920> there's<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.010> reason<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:12.299> saw<00:01:12.590> what<00:01:13.590> I

but there's a reason or they saw what I
think<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> reason<00:01:14.850> why<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.210> changed

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
might accidentally swipe to a different

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.810 
might accidentally swipe to a different
tab<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.259> kadesha<00:01:34.829> Y<00:01:34.920> instead<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
tab on kadesha Y instead of so I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
tab on kadesha Y instead of so I
actually<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.350> maybe<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
actually I think this or or maybe if you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
actually I think this or or maybe if you
tuned<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.689> you're<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:39.960> swiping

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
tuned in and then if you're just swiping

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
tuned in and then if you're just swiping
and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.979> might<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.159> accidentally

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and then you might have accidentally

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.940 
and then you might have accidentally
touched<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.899> didn't<00:01:43.110> occur<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> me

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
touched it and that didn't occur to me

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.480 
touched it and that didn't occur to me
sometimes<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.680> might<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.070> reason<00:01:47.460> why

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
sometimes and that might be a reason why

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.800 
sometimes and that might be a reason why
they<00:01:47.759> changed<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:49.710> problem<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.810> with

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they changed it but a problem with with

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
they changed it but a problem with with
the<00:01:51.930> fact<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.350> moved<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the fact that they moved it here is that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
the fact that they moved it here is that
if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.810> one-handed<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.130> actually

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
if you are one-handed it's actually

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.780 
if you are one-handed it's actually
easier<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.509> swipe<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.280> side<00:01:59.490> or

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
easier to swipe through in this side or

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
easier to swipe through in this side or
that<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.119> rather<00:02:00.960> than<00:02:01.049> doing<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> top

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that side rather than doing at the top

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.639 
that side rather than doing at the top
so<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.270> tend<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> use<00:02:04.409> two

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
so you know you tend to have to use two

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.639 
so you know you tend to have to use two
hands<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.520> put<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.600> hand<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.259> an<00:02:07.350> awkward

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
hands or I put your hand in an awkward

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.919 
hands or I put your hand in an awkward
position<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.250> swipe<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> maybe<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.780> might

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
position and swipe it maybe it might

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.020 
position and swipe it maybe it might
have<00:02:10.050> been<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> better<00:02:10.530> idea

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
have been a better idea

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.690 
have been a better idea
after<00:02:12.030> URLs

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
after URLs

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.550 
after URLs

Windows 8 Internet Explorer and just I'm

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.970 
Windows 8 Internet Explorer and just I'm
just<00:02:19.900> pointing<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.680> easier<00:02:20.950> to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
just pointing out because it's easier to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.940 
just pointing out because it's easier to
use<00:02:21.160> by<00:02:21.640> hand<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> could<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.650> leave<00:02:23.920> it

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
use by hand but or I could just leave it

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.580 
use by hand but or I could just leave it
like<00:02:24.069> what<00:02:24.459> they<00:02:24.580> did<00:02:24.760> over<00:02:24.940> here<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.379> on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
like what they did over here on the on

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.059 
like what they did over here on the on
the<00:02:26.739> old<00:02:26.890> Chrome<00:02:27.430> browser<00:02:28.180> where<00:02:28.840> they<00:02:29.069> can

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
the old Chrome browser where they can

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.259 
the old Chrome browser where they can
just<00:02:30.099> swipe<00:02:30.569> through<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:32.170> sorting<00:02:32.739> anywhere

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
just swipe through just sorting anywhere

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.080 
just swipe through just sorting anywhere
but<00:02:34.269> that's<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.550> could<00:02:36.550> be<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> reason<00:02:37.060> why

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
but that's one could be a reason why

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.000 
but that's one could be a reason why
they<00:02:37.300> changed<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.319> there<00:02:38.680> are<00:02:38.799> other

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
they changed it but so there are other

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
they changed it but so there are other
swiping<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.510> added<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:40.989> so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
swiping just just that they added in so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.009 
swiping just just that they added in so
for<00:02:41.530> instance<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.330> act<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.900> see

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
for instance now you can act you can see

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.600 
for instance now you can act you can see
all<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> tabs<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.010> press<00:02:45.430> this

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
button but you can also do that by just

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.960 
button but you can also do that by just
swiping<00:02:48.819> down<00:02:49.299> from<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> URL<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.530> whoops<00:02:51.400> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
swiping down from the URL so whoops and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.880 
swiping down from the URL so whoops and
the<00:02:52.599> animation<00:02:53.140> that's<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.349> bit<00:02:53.470> different<00:02:53.860> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the animation that's a bit different so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
or shutting it down like that animation

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.550 
or shutting it down like that animation
is<00:03:00.910> different<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.480> play<00:03:01.630> around<00:03:01.750> okay<00:03:02.500> so
