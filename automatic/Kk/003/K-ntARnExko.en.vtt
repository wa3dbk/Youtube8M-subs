right so how it works is that you just
kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:50.390> handy-dandy

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
kind of take it I have a handy-dandy

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
kind of take it I have a handy-dandy
power<00:01:53.820> bar<00:01:54.030> over<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.640> all

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
can see there that the battery pack is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.450 
can see there that the battery pack is
not<00:02:49.390> yet<00:02:49.570> full<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.740> full<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
not yet full so when it is full the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.310 
not yet full so when it is full the
second<00:02:52.240> blue<00:02:52.360> light<00:02:52.540> over<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> left

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
second blue light over here to the left

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.400 
second blue light over here to the left
will<00:02:53.770> fill<00:02:54.460> up<00:02:54.490> now<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.780> does<00:02:55.990> have<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
will fill up now this does have the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.710 
will fill up now this does have the
smart<00:02:56.740> technology<00:02:58.380> where<00:02:59.380> if<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:01.150> plug<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.540> in

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
smart technology where if you plug it in

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.810 
smart technology where if you plug it in
if<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.590> plugged<00:03:02.770> in<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.160> then<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.490> plug<00:03:03.670> it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
if it's plugged in and then you plug it

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.460 
if it's plugged in and then you plug it
into<00:03:03.940> your<00:03:04.030> iPhone<00:03:04.420> it'll<00:03:04.690> charge<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.290> iphone

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
into your iPhone it'll charge the iphone

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.460 
into your iPhone it'll charge the iphone
first<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.340> then<00:03:07.060> it'll<00:03:07.450> charge<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.290> back

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
first and then it'll charge the back

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.640 
first and then it'll charge the back
backup<00:03:09.220> battery<00:03:09.580> second<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> there<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.560> go

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
backup battery second so there you go

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.050 
backup battery second so there you go
you<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:12.010> see<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.280> light<00:03:12.400> turned<00:03:12.640> off<00:03:12.790> there

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
you can see the light turned off there

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.660 
you can see the light turned off there
and<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.570> battery<00:03:13.990> came<00:03:14.020> on<00:03:14.380> here<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.520> can

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and the battery came on here so you can

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.030 
and the battery came on here so you can
it<00:03:16.570> does<00:03:16.810> charge<00:03:18.870> your<00:03:19.870> phone<00:03:20.080> first<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.470> then

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
it does charge your phone first and then

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.630 
it does charge your phone first and then
the<00:03:21.070> backup<00:03:21.490> battery<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.490> could

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
the backup battery so I think you could

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.860 
the backup battery so I think you could
just<00:03:24.760> leave<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.030> there<00:03:25.060> now<00:03:25.420> there<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.720> no

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
just leave it there now there is no

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.290 
just leave it there now there is no
brace<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:26.350> anything<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.860> keep<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.190> leveled<00:03:27.550> so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
brace or anything to keep it leveled so

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.240 
brace or anything to keep it leveled so
it<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.570> kind<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.960> delicate<00:03:29.470> around<00:03:29.920> here<00:03:30.070> so

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
it is kind of delicate around here so

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.950 
it is kind of delicate around here so
you<00:03:30.310> might<00:03:30.490> when<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.030> charging<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.810> might

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
you might when is charging you might

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.470 
you might when is charging you might
want<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.170> leave<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.590> table<00:03:32.860> or<00:03:33.480> somewhere

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
want to leave it on a table or somewhere

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480 
want to leave it on a table or somewhere
that<00:03:34.630> it's<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.230> will<00:03:35.530> be<00:03:35.710> stable<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.220> will<00:03:36.370> be

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
that it's it will be stable it will be

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.200 
that it's it will be stable it will be
secure<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.480> not<00:03:37.630> wiggling<00:03:37.870> around

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
secure so that it's not wiggling around

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.490 
secure so that it's not wiggling around
but<00:03:40.210> it's<00:03:40.330> not<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.630> battery<00:03:40.930> battery<00:03:41.260> pack

at least to charge the day so it might

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.830 
at least to charge the day so it might
not<00:03:53.440> fulfill<00:03:53.950> your<00:03:54.160> needs<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:55.510> my<00:03:55.660> needs

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it it does the job if I'm running low

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.600 
it it does the job if I'm running low
one<00:03:58.360> day<00:03:58.830> usually<00:03:59.830> I'll<00:03:59.920> charge<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.520> every

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
one day usually I'll charge it every

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.820 
one day usually I'll charge it every
other<00:04:00.790> day<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.180> sometimes<00:04:01.840> I'll<00:04:02.110> overuse<00:04:02.650> it

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
other day but sometimes I'll overuse it

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.740 
other day but sometimes I'll overuse it
one<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.250> days<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.240> I'll<00:04:04.360> need<00:04:04.510> something

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
one of the days so I'll need something

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.490
