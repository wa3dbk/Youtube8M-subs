00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 dry inside 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.420

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.070
 a bit skeptical at first then they have me 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.130
 explained the waterproof membrane e 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.009
 attached to the upper is not attached to the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 interior lining so there is no one 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.259
 space then the water just does not enter 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.270
 it slipped away was in fact we did 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.710
 not only the hours and hours of walking but 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.420

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.260
 and very pragmatic view also in 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.540
