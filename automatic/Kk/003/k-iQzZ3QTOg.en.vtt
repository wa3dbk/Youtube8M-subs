00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 so that the ball came out and l 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.080
 and we are going to present you of the one that treats the diploma for in children's diploma 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.789
 dramatic 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.499
 this one takes with children between 9 to 14 years 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.060
 i the we are teaching judge in first east endesa more with what is the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.419
 mechanical but mechanical al sme chambered scaly cameras 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.249
 what are the functions of deception 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.399
 Menem is left with the gears how the robots will be handled to what we have 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.089
 that explaining the ideal is that he will make the difference between equity is a 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.089
 rob atc and that it is a machine and of what is possible that they are learning to 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.460
 as it goes of course 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.960
 we also went to what programming 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.510
 where we told him that they were different types of commands that they understood for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 what were the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.710
 to the output 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.840
 loose link 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.230
 i palla after having given them the general explanation we started with the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.110
 initials that as we can see here explodes three decades because in the end it goes 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.150
 to see a contest 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 you can understand who they want how a robbery will be 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.070
 in the missions that they have to do is that the rome has to get to the lake 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.780
 that of demos in the center 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 i light a little 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.510
 the window to the duckling in the part of the robot's display has to appear 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.710
 a happy face 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 and after that return to the base 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.110
 in another of the ens missions as well as the ones around 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510
 the most important thing for us 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.880
 that with the theft the fiorentina catching all 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380
 deere carlos el cor the pressure of being here this elevator that we see 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 if they the elevator launched any of them 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.810
 in we are going to give you extra points and if only the Havana carlos find 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 this the base give me the points of the motion 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.780
 nor the others because here friend who side explains good I was also is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.990
 the one of traversing it ciclopista to cross it ciclopista is very simple has that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.300
 follow the trail 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.060
 this sport two shores east until you get to where they started 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 It is a difficult vision because the programming is very long 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.150
 this later they have to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.659
 and those from the auditorium 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 this one to pull out the thorn 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.559
 the audience simply have to drag the outside of the red part 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.209
 this disc in that ccaa in the mission have to return in each mission to 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.819
 parking where they started 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.859
 in each mission you have to start the program and finish the program 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.499
 means that the theft could have been running at the end of the program 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.669
 this 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.879
 he also has to measure constitution length 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 from behind the very simple containment arch 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.579
 they travel this 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.229
 from the beginning of the constitution to the end 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.739
 send a number to a variable and that variable will be heard before the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.669
 screen and the screen shows it for a certain time so that the 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.319
 user can see them 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.039
 the user the law then this one is marked the length 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.730
 this one of the robberies are not very accurate for that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.099
 but if this one 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.569
 baldassi the magnitudes of seem too much so 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.859
 children can find this certain similarities in their programs in 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.629
 how about your programming 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.139
 as soon as its programming regarding its design 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.189
 good of the cobat environment of the ability to choose things 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.629
 this is why children have to look for a design that is competent 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.430
 for that the front calipers 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.099
 that they are not too big miners towards girls but that they are two 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.159
 enough to pick up pieces from one side to another 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.879
 this 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.889
 in a simpler way 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.789
 this was to get to do complicated missions as it is to collect the 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.979
 pieces of art and move them from a DNA entrance point of the foundry park 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.079
 up to an exhibition cover 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.189
 this in this case move art pieces of crime orio 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.559
 the one in the mountain king 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:57.539
 to the art gallery what the mission is for is good the ad hoc east 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.339
 with mind in one in 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:05.809
 in the missions or in this one normal is given a score this score 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:10.869
 representatives that the ability of each team to program design make a 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.869
 good mechanics have a good team work a good presentation 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.969
 this that are coordinated that are friendly with each other 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.490
 then I'm good that's one of the very qualified during the course 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.900
 we are constantly working with each of the teams 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.009
 and reviewing their programs 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.400
 this one too 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.779
 sins that get along well that teams are compatible 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.840
 what 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.779
 that not that he does not argue before chester coordinate 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.069
 coli in what is the mechanical work with programming 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.240
 percent and in that way they are still given a certain opont age or a 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.020
 certain type of evaluation 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.389
 so that they know what their performance is in 1 normal event 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.830
 and that way they obtain by a landslide or fil this a good benefit of a temple 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.930
 child madoc 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.029
 Well, the idea is so good because it allows them to 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.830
 give little ones to children the notion of what is robotics the 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:11.699
 mechanics this one being one of them has aspirations to be an engineer in a 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.180
 future is to say the truth we are 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.059
 in this act saying that 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.360
 and so that it is compared that the rules are known and as per hundred then 

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.330
 here the ue remove the facilities to lend their services 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.960
 to such the cinema to which they learn 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.939
 Well, what better is that the two get together 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.469
 to all those who have participated with us in this framework and especially 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.469
 thank the real wedding or not after passing by giving us this opportunity 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.930
 not only for the benefit that we get but for the 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.349
 because we had a lot of fun 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.800
 opinions that bind and caleÃ±as of the apple store in the ipa is 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.389
 among all this take this forward 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.599
 implement this expert
