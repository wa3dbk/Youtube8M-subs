their<00:02:46.250> shows<00:02:46.520> immediately<00:02:47.030> following<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
their shows immediately following the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.660 
their shows immediately following the
Olympia<00:02:48.260> which<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.100> obviously<00:02:49.310> give<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.580> the
