 hi the gamers day 6 mn I hope that 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.990
 it's okay it's going nickel 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.110
 so today I'm going to do a little 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.470
 bug actually on base on by on black ops 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.540
 2 and this bug it can be feasible by 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.760
 everyone already we already 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.570
 this bug actually it is to be 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.910
 invincible so in zombies with in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 actually buying a centex and getting 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.130
 putting in a corner of lighthouse piece or 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.480
 a map corner so already masters like that 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.800
 we put five sleeves and we will launch 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.420
 so go i wanted to say thank you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 for those who watch videos because 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.740
 that well I'm soon to his bonus and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.810
 I'm pretty happy with myself and 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.229
 8 ch continues to make videos not 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 this because the state benoit me it's not 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.120
 but be careful then 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.450
 so this bug can last a very long time 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.710
 it's just to demonstrate because I 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 I want to say it just not 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.920
 difficult years so look at the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.730
 you bought the centex then 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.470
 they are there 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.590
 the prices 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
 and while I put myself in it we got it 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.230
 we are your centex you stay supported 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 on r2 and you put like this then 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.510
 you have just in time that the zombies 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510
 Vienna is normally 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.850
 2 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.430
 ilan 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 just in time 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 so accurate just time but we laugh 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.550
 but he 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.710
 so will I hope I hope my 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 you like the mans because in 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.480
 the comments you do not put your 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.710
 thing 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.990
 which is a shame 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.870
 but it does not matter it would be cool like 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.950
 I say all the time of m 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.150
 am concerned about it look at all 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.150
 all the zombies who think the most 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.700
