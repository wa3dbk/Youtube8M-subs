so<00:00:00.450> today<00:00:00.750> with<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> camera<00:00:01.410> for<00:00:01.650> e<00:00:01.680> equals<00:00:02.100> M

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so today with the camera for e equals M

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.379 
so today with the camera for e equals M
six<00:00:02.460> what<00:00:02.639> we're<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.179> shoot

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
six what we're going to do is shoot

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.999 
six what we're going to do is shoot
bullets<00:00:03.600> through<00:00:04.049> three<00:00:04.319> kinds<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.740> glass

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
bullets through three kinds of glass

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.880 
bullets through three kinds of glass
we've<00:00:05.400> got<00:00:05.580> regular<00:00:06.210> plate<00:00:06.480> glass<00:00:06.720> which<00:00:07.710> is

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
we've got regular plate glass which is

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.770 
we've got regular plate glass which is
like<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.730> window<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.269> then

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
like what you have in a window and then

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.200 
like what you have in a window and then
we've<00:00:09.990> got<00:00:10.099> tempered<00:00:11.099> glass<00:00:11.130> which<00:00:11.969> will

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
we've got tempered glass which will

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.640 
we've got tempered glass which will
break<00:00:12.389> very<00:00:12.599> differently<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> kind<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
break very differently it's the kind of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.220 
break very differently it's the kind of
stuff<00:00:13.860> sort<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.519> automobile

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
stuff sort of like in automobile

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
stuff sort of like in automobile
windshields<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.320> then<00:00:17.070> we're<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> do

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
windshields and then we're going to do

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
windshields and then we're going to do
some<00:00:18.740> bulletproof<00:00:19.740> glass<00:00:19.920> which<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
some bulletproof glass which is what you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
some bulletproof glass which is what you
have<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> bank<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.689> hopefully<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.199> won't

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
have in a bank and hopefully we won't

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:38.610 
have in a bank and hopefully we won't
see<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> bullet<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.070> through<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.460> all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:01:09.780 

one

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.870 

one<00:01:14.740> with<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> tempered<00:01:16.190> glass<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.640> such<00:01:16.759> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
one with the tempered glass is such a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.420 
one with the tempered glass is such a
totally<00:01:17.360> different<00:01:17.690> kind<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:18.020> break<00:01:18.430> where

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
totally different kind of break where

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.639 
totally different kind of break where
the<00:01:19.820> shot<00:01:20.149> gets<00:01:20.479> translated<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.259> cracks<00:01:21.500> are

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
the shot gets translated the cracks are

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:22.990 
the shot gets translated the cracks are
translated<00:01:22.130> throughout<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.490> whole<00:01:22.640> material

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
translated throughout the whole material

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.539 
translated throughout the whole material
and<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.350> destroys<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.220> very

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
and so it just destroys it very

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:26.920 
and so it just destroys it very
different<00:01:25.880> than<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.060> plate<00:01:26.360> glass<00:01:26.479> where<00:01:26.840> you

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
different than the plate glass where you

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.719 
different than the plate glass where you
can<00:01:27.080> just<00:01:27.229> poke<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.500> hole<00:01:27.619> through<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:28.009> here

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
can just poke a hole through it here

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.010 
can just poke a hole through it here
what<00:01:28.940> we'll<00:01:29.090> see<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.390> we'll<00:01:29.600> see<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.840> bullet

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
what we'll see is we'll see the bullet

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.990 
what we'll see is we'll see the bullet
coming<00:01:30.259> through<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.890> you'll<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.670> sort<00:01:31.940> of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
coming through and you'll see sort of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120 
coming through and you'll see sort of
rings<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.569> cracks<00:01:33.140> developing<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.100> then

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
rings of cracks developing and then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.980 
rings of cracks developing and then
going<00:01:34.550> quickly<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> edge<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.780> glass

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
going quickly to the edge of the glass

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:58.500 
going quickly to the edge of the glass
in<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:37.039> big<00:01:37.250> sort<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.580> spider<00:01:37.850> web<00:01:38.030> pattern

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.300 

the<00:01:59.510> energy<00:02:00.290> from<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> bullet<00:02:01.010> which<00:02:01.159> is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the energy from the bullet which is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
the energy from the bullet which is
going<00:02:01.460> all<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.030> direction<00:02:02.210> has<00:02:02.690> been

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
going all in this direction has been

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.800 
going all in this direction has been
completely<00:02:03.670> distributed<00:02:04.670> out<00:02:05.030> radially<00:02:05.450> and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
completely distributed out radially and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.990 
completely distributed out radially and
it<00:02:06.140> almost<00:02:06.290> looks<00:02:06.680> like<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.850> lead

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it almost looks like some of the lead

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:22.100 
it almost looks like some of the lead
was<00:02:08.240> boiling

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.550 

a<00:02:23.000> lot<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.150> things<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.540> are<00:02:24.660> violent<00:02:25.200> when

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
a lot of things that are violent when

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
a lot of things that are violent when
you<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.100> extreme<00:02:26.460> slow<00:02:26.670> motion<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.060> kid

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
you do it in extreme slow motion a kid

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.730 
you do it in extreme slow motion a kid
really<00:02:27.420> looks<00:02:27.720> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.960> elegant<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.560> see

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
really looks kind of elegant you see

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.290 
really looks kind of elegant you see
this<00:02:28.860> sort<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.160> unfolding<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.150> these

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
this sort of unfolding of all these

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.530 
this sort of unfolding of all these
events<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.760> complexity<00:02:33.330> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
events and and all this complexity that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
events and and all this complexity that
you<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:34.170> otherwise<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.580> be

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
you don't otherwise see in it it can be

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.090 
you don't otherwise see in it it can be
really<00:02:35.850> beautiful
