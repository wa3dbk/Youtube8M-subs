00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
this is actually I think probably the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.729 
this is actually I think probably the
low-rent<00:03:06.630> district<00:03:07.109> because<00:03:07.349> these<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.620> not

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
low-rent district because these are not

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.280 
low-rent district because these are not
beachfront<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.670> they're<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.930> swim<00:03:10.139> up

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.710 
beachfront and they're not the swim up
rooms<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.069> this<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.549> bad<00:03:11.849> huh<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
