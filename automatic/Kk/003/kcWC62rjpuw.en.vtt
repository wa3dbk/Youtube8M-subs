goes behind that question I mean you got
I've<00:00:30.820> been<00:00:31.000> racing<00:00:31.150> for<00:00:31.330> 18<00:00:31.720> years<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.289> lot

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
I've been racing for 18 years so a lot

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.319 
I've been racing for 18 years so a lot
of<00:00:32.529> preparation<00:00:33.100> there<00:00:33.280> but<00:00:33.550> once<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.150> get<00:00:34.270> to

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
of preparation there but once you get to

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.900 
of preparation there but once you get to
the<00:00:34.510> event<00:00:34.840> four<00:00:35.770> days<00:00:35.920> ago<00:00:36.160> we're<00:00:36.340> practicing

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
the event four days ago we're practicing

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.600 
the event four days ago we're practicing
running<00:00:37.240> about<00:00:37.390> 3-4<00:00:37.870> hours<00:00:38.170> straight<00:00:39.130> time<00:00:39.340> on

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
running about 3-4 hours straight time on

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.520 
running about 3-4 hours straight time on
the<00:00:39.790> track<00:00:40.000> trying<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.750> find<00:00:40.900> good<00:00:41.079> setups

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
the track trying to find good setups

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.310 
the track trying to find good setups
trying<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.130> fight<00:00:42.250> what<00:00:42.460> tires<00:00:42.700> work

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
trying to fight what tires work

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.420 
trying to fight what tires work
suspension<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.500> mean<00:00:44.770> there's<00:00:44.980> just<00:00:45.130> so<00:00:45.280> much

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
suspension I mean there's just so much

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.040 
suspension I mean there's just so much
that<00:00:45.610> goes<00:00:45.730> involved<00:00:46.120> with<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.600> timing<00:00:46.960> of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
that goes involved with it the timing of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.990 
that goes involved with it the timing of
the<00:00:47.140> jumps<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:48.310> difference<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.790> track

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
the jumps the difference in track

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.290 
the jumps the difference in track
conditions<00:00:49.450> from<00:00:49.630> one<00:00:49.870> hour<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.350> next

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
conditions from one hour to the next

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.549 
conditions from one hour to the next
just<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.390> lot<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.630> preparation<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.290> lot<00:00:53.440> of

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
just a lot of preparation a lot of

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.740 
just a lot of preparation a lot of
preparation<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.149> comes<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.450> preparation

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
preparation when it comes to preparation

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.720 
preparation when it comes to preparation
let's<00:00:56.200> talk<00:00:56.350> track<00:00:56.980> prep<00:00:57.250> here<00:00:57.399> for<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.610> little

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
let's talk track prep here for a little

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.729 
let's talk track prep here for a little
bit<00:00:57.910> we're<00:00:58.360> in<00:00:58.450> Phoenix<00:00:58.809> Arizona<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.680> about

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
bit we're in Phoenix Arizona it's about

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.340 
bit we're in Phoenix Arizona it's about
100<00:01:00.130> degrees<00:01:00.160> out<00:01:00.670> what<00:01:01.390> challenges<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.960> see

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
100 degrees out what challenges you see

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.680 
100 degrees out what challenges you see
on<00:01:02.469> the<00:01:02.500> track<00:01:02.800> because<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.340> weather<00:01:03.690> big

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
on the track because of the weather big

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.969 
on the track because of the weather big
challenge<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.260> actually<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.740> track

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
challenge is actually the track

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.560 
challenge is actually the track
temperature<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.909> amount<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.360> traction

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
temperature and the amount of traction

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.750 
temperature and the amount of traction
it<00:01:07.840> creates<00:01:08.170> right<00:01:09.010> now<00:01:09.130> we're<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.490> we're

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
it creates right now we're like we're

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.550 
it creates right now we're like we're
looking<00:01:10.000> at<00:01:10.150> like<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.330> blue<00:01:10.600> groove<00:01:10.840> situation

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
looking at like a blue groove situation

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.380 
looking at like a blue groove situation
which<00:01:12.040> means<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.400> rubber<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:12.880> actually<00:01:13.210> laid

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
which means that rubber is actually laid

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.840 
which means that rubber is actually laid
down<00:01:13.570> on<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.810> track<00:01:14.170> from<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.070> tires<00:01:15.370> wearing

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
down on the track from the tires wearing

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.940 
down on the track from the tires wearing
out<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.690> creates<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.020> really<00:01:17.080> really

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
out and it creates this really really

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.770 
out and it creates this really really
strong<00:01:18.250> attraction<00:01:18.580> what<00:01:19.360> we're<00:01:19.510> trying<00:01:19.659> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
strong attraction what we're trying to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.289 
strong attraction what we're trying to
do<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.049> actually<00:01:20.460> minimize<00:01:21.460> attraction<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.270> a

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
do is actually minimize attraction to a

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.780 
do is actually minimize attraction to a
degree<00:01:22.479> too<00:01:23.140> much<00:01:23.320> traction<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:24.280> truck<00:01:24.520> wants

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
degree too much traction the truck wants

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.969 
degree too much traction the truck wants
to<00:01:24.880> tip<00:01:25.090> over<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.630> really<00:01:26.470> become<00:01:26.590> kind<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
to tip over and really become kind of

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.830 
to tip over and really become kind of
squirming<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.549> corners<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.600> want<00:01:28.780> to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
squirming in the corners so you want to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.030 
squirming in the corners so you want to
try<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.080> free<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> up<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.590> little<00:01:29.710> bit<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.979> where

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
try and free it up a little bit to where

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.730 
try and free it up a little bit to where
it's<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.189> little<00:01:30.400> more<00:01:30.460> consistent<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:32.650> of

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
it's a little more consistent and one of

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.830 
it's a little more consistent and one of
the<00:01:32.799> main<00:01:32.920> things<00:01:32.950> we<00:01:33.220> do<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.460> do<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:34.000> kind<00:01:34.720> of

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
the main things we do to do to kind of

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.010 
the main things we do to do to kind of
counteract<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> tire<00:01:36.580> compound<00:01:37.090> today

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
counteract that is a tire compound today

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.649 
counteract that is a tire compound today
we're<00:01:38.350> using<00:01:38.530> an<00:01:38.890> ex<00:01:39.070> TR<00:01:39.369> compound<00:01:39.880> which<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.630> a

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
we're using an ex TR compound which is a
