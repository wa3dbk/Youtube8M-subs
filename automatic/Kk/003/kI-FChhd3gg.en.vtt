00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.670
 and what about 95 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.700
 scope of work associated with fine-tuning the machine 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.630
 engines were much more 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.039
 planned 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.949
 the second copy of the aircraft went to 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.419
 tests in February 55 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.539
 total power standing on it 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.890
 turboprop 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 made 48 thousand horsepower 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.829
 195 showed range 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.669
 14 thousand kilometers 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.160
 already during the test 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 and before the end was launched in a series 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.390
 it so happened that he is much 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.640
 survived in the country 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 there's more 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 and all this time due to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.560
 onboard improvement 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.480
 equipment 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360
 from weapons 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.400
 his combat potential steadily increased 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 in the 50s, the aviation forecast was 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 unexpected 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250
 but even more rapidly developed 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 rocket science 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.420
 on intercontinental 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.259
 ballistic missiles but still 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:18.940
 worse 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 but there were others 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.110
 or how they were then called the plane 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.160
 will deliver 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.070
 really 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.909
 with chronic failing them 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.020
 first generation bombers to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.250
 desired flight range application 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.080
 increasing means 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.870
 the combat radius turned out 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.300
 way out 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.910
 but also 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.030
 appearance of the enemy supersonic 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.480
 interceptors and anti-aircraft progress 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.150
 funds left less and less a chance 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.740
 car break into the center 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 for the answers that the plane could not 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 go into protected on pick-up launches 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.380
 mechanism 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 but how to place rockets on 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.220
 bomber 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.170
 the fact is that the first aircraft shells were 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.180
 rather cumbersome oooh bombers 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.190
 have Russian fuselage to lower 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.220
 resistance constructors like 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.329
 may already in may of its cross section 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.309
 so you could only hang them 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.339
 outside 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.079
 cold about a different position under 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.049
 fuselage 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.519
 either on the fenders pylons 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.180
 it created additional 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.459
 of events 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.450
 still the same total range 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.380
 actions of such a combat system 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.630
 was more than just 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.630
 bombers 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.120
 for strategic bombers was 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.719
 created the plane was standing 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.089
 as carrier 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.319
 for him the most suitable 095 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.669
 received in rocket-carrying rents 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.729
 designations 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.729
 95 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.899
 separated from the carrier and to 20 dialed 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.970
 height of 15 thousand meters 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.780
 he faces up to more than five hundred 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.810
 kilometers 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 double speed 7 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.640
 before the appearance of that 160 strategic niche in 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.019
 defense ranked up to 90 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.290
 and despite the fact that its modernization was 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.419
 constantly truly second wind 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.859
 bomber opened with an appearance 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.969
 qualitatively new modification 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.339
 that 95 m with 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.779
 he looks like his first parents 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.089
 but the capabilities of the aircraft are significant 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.229
 increased 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.649
 new radioelectronic 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:31.079
 rub 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.599
 onboard computers 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.729
 most powerful means of electronic 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.559
 countermeasures are able to knock off 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.569
 sense the smartest guidance system 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.259
 enemy missiles 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.049
 in the arsenal of this strategic 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.609
 missile carrier to sixteen winged 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.609
 55 hart missiles 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.619
 but the most amazing 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.239
 with all these global 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.289
 by car equipped toilet for members 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.149
 crew 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.709
 for the first time since that 4 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.859
 on cars that have been created so far with 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.669
 flight activities up to tens of hours 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.579
 yes I do not think such little things
