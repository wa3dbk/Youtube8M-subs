00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.590
 God's friends are with you from 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.110
 infiniti today I bring you something somewhat 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.180
 a weird one this Easter egg 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.700
 this dlc that as many of you already know 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.120
 we are playing this pack of horde 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.650
 I think good things first before 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.290
 nothing of course you have already seen 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.180
 spoiler for those who like those 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.930
 small details I do not want to decipher 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.610
 more without anyone saying so I wanted to know 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.960
 by myself good because it is in 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.810
 Downloading content as it is 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 evident already you know previous payment and in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.229
 confrontation in the clouds first thing 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.570
 what we have to do is finish the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.820
 four maps there are already users that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 they had warned of the tÃ©rek and good not 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.420
 nothing happens because it is not that it is a 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.630
 easter egg very transcendent i of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.230
 done I think they had planned it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.600
 let's say for 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.860
 and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.840
 Well, to be quiet is that already 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.330
 We all know what will be in rapture 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.990
 once key of columbia and rap tour by 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 the characters but the rap turn and good 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.580
 I suppose because of the criticism of the people 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.979
 I was a little angry and tired 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.390
 and such because in the end they have had to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.549
 say what was the future of 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.799
 s &amp; p good as you see I'm missing so alone 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.990
 a medal that incidentally were attached 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.479
 as soon as I finish this challenge that is the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.810
 number 13 of the map 4 bone I will found how 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.150
 perform all the challenges because 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.970
 they are a tedious little 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.709
 all the last ones but as you can see, it has 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.900
 pretty well worth it then once 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.050
 we finished the four maps means 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.200
 we finished round 15 we finished it 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.209
 they do not kill us if we do not finish and they give us 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 our statistics you can see if 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.650
 you have finished it here you know 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.510
 exposes a number 15 and tells you what 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.510
 Well, you have completed the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.480
 the hordes have nothing to do with 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.300
 the challenges means you can 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.150
 have 15 medals 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.340
 forgive eight medals but really 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.440
 have completed the 15 hours 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.110
 that's all you have to do 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 to get this easter egg 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.430
 it's very fast so lend the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.620
 attention because it is very fast and as I have 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.010
 Well, well, I think that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.730
 course it talks about latent rapture 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.730
 to the police 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.830
 but also that does not last like that 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.320
 you said and this is something easter 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.840
 to yes man the grace of all this is 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.230
 what 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.420
 I repeat, I think they had saved it 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.900
 so that only those who had the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.140
 will play this DLCI know a little what 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.150
 could come but good as small 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.519
 I'm going to make programs fast in case 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.650
 perhaps someone has not realized that 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.660
 let not shoot or anything to 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.580
 that you give a little but basically 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.610
 for those who do not know bioshock 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 classic the original because it is one of the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.590
 of the thugs 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.349
 they make life miserable for a sprinter 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.450
 of those behind us 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.400
 continuously along the map voucher 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.470
 well you know you are in the museum 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 and from time to time 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.209
 it's that short and it's a shame it's a 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 pity could last longer than chasing 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.760
 or something but it's like that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.440
 however, despite it being an egg of 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.500
 very short easter that has been done 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.799
 Illusion see this splitter and how good 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.120
 Well, we'll see you soon on that map that 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.560
 we are of course in addition to the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.260
 milk futures which as you 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.540
 confirm I will upload them of course 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.100
 comrades see you until the next 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.840
 He asked for cortito that you then tell me not to 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.840
 I make video is short I'll see you
