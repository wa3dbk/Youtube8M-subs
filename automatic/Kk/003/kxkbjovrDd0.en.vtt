technological artifacts as you see when
we<00:00:15.900> put<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> toast<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.890> er<00:00:17.039> goes<00:00:17.910> down

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
any lever to be pushed down to say at

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580 
any lever to be pushed down to say at
the<00:00:23.340> timer<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> course<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.960> fires<00:00:25.380> up

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the timer and of course it fires up

the timer and of course it fires up
inside<00:00:25.920> no<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> t20<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> tell

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
inside no this is a t20 see you can tell

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
inside no this is a t20 see you can tell
by<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> design<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> side<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.150> there's<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
by the design on the side and there's a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
by the design on the side and there's a
t20<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.199> underneath<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.669> made

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
t20 see underneath this was made

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.959 
t20 see underneath this was made
probably<00:00:33.899> around<00:00:34.260> 1958<00:00:35.070> which<00:00:35.460> means<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
probably around 1958 which means that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.190 
probably around 1958 which means that
it's<00:00:36.090> almost<00:00:36.450> 55<00:00:37.140> years<00:00:37.469> old<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.690> yet<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
it's almost 55 years old and yet the you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
it's almost 55 years old and yet the you
know<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> high<00:00:40.800> quality<00:00:41.100> toaster<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
know was a high quality toaster of that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
know was a high quality toaster of that
era<00:00:42.920> um<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.320> barmaid<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.129> until

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
era um so the the barmaid right up until

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880 
era um so the the barmaid right up until
in<00:00:47.690> 1997<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.079> haven't<00:00:49.350> been<00:00:49.500> made<00:00:49.710> for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
in 1997 so they haven't been made for

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.060 
in 1997 so they haven't been made for
like<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.610> 15<00:00:51.239> years<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.840> guess<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> main

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
like you know 15 years I guess the main

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
like you know 15 years I guess the main
problem<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.940> were<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.390> expensive

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
problem was these were very expensive

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
problem was these were very expensive
they<00:00:55.350> were<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.620> $80<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.730> guess<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> end

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
they were like $80 I guess at the end

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.260 
they were like $80 I guess at the end
and<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.579> hard<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> compete<00:01:00.210> with

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and you know that's hard to compete with

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
and you know that's hard to compete with
a<00:01:00.449> $10<00:01:01.289> toaster<00:01:01.859> over<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> Kmart<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a $10 toaster over at a Kmart but you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440 
a $10 toaster over at a Kmart but you
know<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.650> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.830> cool<00:01:05.129> design<00:01:05.430> um

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
know this is a kind of a cool design um

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289 
know this is a kind of a cool design um
Oh<00:01:06.600> while<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.409> waiting<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Oh while we're waiting we also have this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
Oh while we're waiting we also have this
cool<00:01:10.080> gizmo<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.439> 2003<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> think

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cool gizmo here now back in 2003 I think

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.060 
cool gizmo here now back in 2003 I think
I<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.610> working<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.450> intern<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> summer<00:01:16.770> job

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I was working as an intern a summer job

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
I was working as an intern a summer job
at<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> place<00:01:17.790> called<00:01:17.820> Auto<00:01:18.479> controls<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.320> one

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
at a place called Auto controls and one

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530 
at a place called Auto controls and one
of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> things<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.130> were<00:01:20.280> developing<00:01:21.030> was

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of the things we were developing was

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.609 
of the things we were developing was
this<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.130> uni<00:01:23.130> directional<00:01:24.229> plug<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this a uni directional plug that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.359 
this a uni directional plug that
basically<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:27.110> put<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.369> milk

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
basically you would put put your milk

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.140 
basically you would put put your milk
jugs<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.930> table<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.640> they<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.790> sit<00:01:33.000> at

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
jugs on the table and they could sit at

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
jugs on the table and they could sit at
any<00:01:33.299> angle<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> remember<00:01:34.530> testing<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
any angle I remember testing this for a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.920 
any angle I remember testing this for a
great<00:01:35.490> many<00:01:35.700> years<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
great many years and here know the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.490 
great many years and here know the
toasters<00:01:37.350> ready<00:01:37.560> unlike<00:01:38.159> those<00:01:38.729> crass

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
toasters ready unlike those crass

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.130 
toasters ready unlike those crass
low-tech<00:01:40.500> cheapo<00:01:41.189> toasters<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.479> toast<00:01:42.780> comes

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
low-tech cheapo toasters the toast comes

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.830 
low-tech cheapo toasters the toast comes
up<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.979> great<00:01:45.439> grease<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.600> that's<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
up with great grease and that's one of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.859 
up with great grease and that's one of
the<00:01:48.930> reasons<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.360> totally

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the reasons I like it it's a totally

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
the reasons I like it it's a totally
automatic<00:01:52.680> toaster<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> has<00:01:53.640> no<00:01:53.850> computer

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
or anything it's entirely a mechanical

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.130 
or anything it's entirely a mechanical
system<00:01:57.299> based<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.430> solenoids
