00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
she had two diet cokes I only had one

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
she had two diet cokes I only had one
her<00:00:55.980> meal<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.520> dollar<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:56.940> than<00:00:57.000> mine

her meal was one dollar more than mine

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
her meal was one dollar more than mine
so<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:57.809> split<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so let's split it up that way that just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.830 
so let's split it up that way that just
lets<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.850> type<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> person<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.570> are

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
lets me know what type of person you are

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
lets me know what type of person you are
and<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.379> tip<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:01.980> likely<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and your tip is more likely to be

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.310 
and your tip is more likely to be
smaller<00:01:02.879> than<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.329> lizard<00:01:03.480> man<00:01:03.840> partners

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
smaller than your lizard man partners

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
smaller than your lizard man partners
lizard<00:01:05.040> people<00:01:05.430> tend<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> tip<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> best

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
lizard people tend to tip the best

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
lizard people tend to tip the best
another<00:01:07.020> annoying<00:01:07.439> thing<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> split

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
another annoying thing is if you split

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
another annoying thing is if you split
your<00:01:08.670> check<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> both<00:01:09.630> pay<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
your check and then you both pay with

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.100 
your check and then you both pay with
cash<00:01:10.409> come<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.850> being<00:01:12.119> lazy<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cash come on that's just being lazy you
