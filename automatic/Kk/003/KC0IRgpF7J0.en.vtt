and wanting to play with us so they here
it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.100> screen<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it is on your screen in the right now I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
it is on your screen in the right now I
may<00:00:49.170> look<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.469> bit<00:00:49.739> daunting<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> little

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
may look a little bit daunting a little

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
may look a little bit daunting a little
bit<00:00:50.700> complicated<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.600> basically<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
bit complicated but basically I have

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.750 
bit complicated but basically I have
designed<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> best<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> can

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
designed it the best way that I can

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
designed it the best way that I can
manually<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.590> sure<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
manually to make sure that we get the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.020 
manually to make sure that we get the
fairest<00:00:56.969> amount<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:58.309> or<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> fairest<00:00:59.850> way

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
fairest amount of or the fairest way

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
fairest amount of or the fairest way
possible<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:02.539> for<00:01:03.539> most<00:01:03.780> players<00:01:04.019> at

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
possible to actually for most players at

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.310 
possible to actually for most players at
least<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.360> stands<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
least the way it stands now is that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
least the way it stands now is that
there<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.280> players<00:01:08.760> who<00:01:09.450> will

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
there will be some players who will

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
there will be some players who will
either<00:01:09.810> play<00:01:10.290> six<00:01:11.010> matches<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
either play six matches to get to the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
either play six matches to get to the
final<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:12.990> they're<00:01:13.350> obese<00:01:13.619> players<00:01:13.920> who<00:01:14.250> have

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
final and they're obese players who have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.730 
final and they're obese players who have
to<00:01:14.760> play<00:01:14.970> five<00:01:15.390> matches<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> final

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to play five matches to get to the final

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
to play five matches to get to the final
and<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> case<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:19.350> just

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and this is actually the case not just

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
and this is actually the case not just
for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> winner's<00:01:20.040> bracket<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.909> also<00:01:21.030> for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
for the winner's bracket but also for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
for the winner's bracket but also for
the<00:01:21.479> loser<00:01:21.750> bracket<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:22.950> made<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the loser bracket so I've made it so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
the loser bracket so I've made it so
that<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:23.970> much<00:01:24.150> identical<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.990> if

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that it's pretty much identical so if

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.899 
that it's pretty much identical so if
you<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.470> lose<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.979> literally<00:01:26.430> getting<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you do lose you're literally getting a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
you do lose you're literally getting a
second<00:01:27.299> chance<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> exact<00:01:29.159> same

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
second chance and the exact same

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
second chance and the exact same
condition<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:30.659> playing<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.320> who

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
condition but you're playing people who

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469 
condition but you're playing people who
lost<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:32.159> opposed<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> playing<00:01:32.850> people<00:01:33.270> who

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
lost as opposed to playing people who

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
lost as opposed to playing people who
won<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.810> yeah<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
won but yeah this is all I have for this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
won but yeah this is all I have for this
video<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.659> short<00:01:40.079> but

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
video I know it's a little short but

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670 
video I know it's a little short but
