00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
another video doing a little test here

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
another video doing a little test here
going<00:00:28.529> through<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:29.160> set<00:00:29.759> up<00:00:29.880> six<00:00:30.179> sheets<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
going through I set up six sheets of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.620 
going through I set up six sheets of
half-inch<00:00:31.439> plywood<00:00:32.000> spaced<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.210> six

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
half-inch plywood spaced about six

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
half-inch plywood spaced about six
inches<00:00:33.840> apart<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.789> to<00:00:38.940> attempt

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
inches apart and I was going to attempt

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
inches apart and I was going to attempt
to<00:00:39.600> shoot<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.050> golf<00:00:40.379> ball<00:00:40.649> through<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.190> many<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to shoot a golf ball through as many as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.689 
to shoot a golf ball through as many as
I<00:00:41.699> could<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.460> size

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
I could but I don't have the right size

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.180 
I could but I don't have the right size
barrel<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> golf<00:00:45.600> ball<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.680> Saturday

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
barrel for a golf ball and it's Saturday

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.680 
barrel for a golf ball and it's Saturday
and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> try<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:49.949> out<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and I really want to try this out so the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
and I really want to try this out so the
only<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.140> could<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.969> was<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:55.219> potato

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
only thing I could think of was a potato

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.840 
only thing I could think of was a potato
of<00:00:56.670> course<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:58.489> frozen<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.579> know<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.730> not

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of course but frozen so I know it's not

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.780 
of course but frozen so I know it's not
going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> exactly<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.719> same<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
going to be exactly the same and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.999 
going to be exactly the same and
eventually<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.330> size<00:01:06.570> pipe

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
eventually I'll get the right size pipe

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.630 
eventually I'll get the right size pipe
to<00:01:08.009> shoot<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> golf<00:01:08.700> ball<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.640> I'm

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
also got a little bored and we're going

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.319 
also got a little bored and we're going
to<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.960> sucker<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.409> shot<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
to get this sucker a shot it's a one and

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.770 
to get this sucker a shot it's a one and
one<00:01:21.509> eighth<00:01:21.689> inch<00:01:22.310> sk<00:01:23.310> socket<00:01:23.869> with<00:01:24.869> 1018<00:01:25.860> nut

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
one eighth inch sk socket with 1018 nut

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
one eighth inch sk socket with 1018 nut
inside<00:01:27.829> with<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> rubber<00:01:29.100> gasket<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:30.329> about

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
inside with a rubber gasket is about

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
inside with a rubber gasket is about
probably<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> half<00:01:31.290> pound<00:01:31.610> just

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
probably about a half pound just

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.840 
probably about a half pound just
guesstimating<00:01:32.970> again<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> we'll<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.759> what

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
guesstimating again but we'll see what

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
guesstimating again but we'll see what
she<00:01:35.909> does<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.810> should<00:01:36.960> probably<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
she does that one should probably have a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
she does that one should probably have a
little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.829> damage<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.090> going

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little bit more damage but we're going

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.139 
little bit more damage but we're going
to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:40.640> first<00:01:41.640> shot<00:01:41.899> at<00:01:44.119> well<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:45.479> compressor

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
to do a first shot at well my compressor

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.200 
to do a first shot at well my compressor
you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> only<00:01:48.719> goes<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.229> about

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210

someday I'll get my big compressor going

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.410 
someday I'll get my big compressor going
again<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.920> we'll<00:02:01.920> try<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.369> 150<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.270> for

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
hole on the sixth board which was the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.479 
hole on the sixth board which was the
first<00:03:40.799> but<00:03:41.219> I<00:03:41.310> flipped<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.639> around<00:03:43.189> but<00:03:44.189> I<00:03:44.220> have
