Pleiades minute all right it's just like

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.830 
Pleiades minute all right it's just like
it's<00:02:18.520> like<00:02:18.640> based<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> corner<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.630> kind

of hard to know if you're there yeah
it's<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.870> stupid<00:02:23.290> stage<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.680> Marvel

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it's like that stupid stage and Marvel

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's like that stupid stage and Marvel
with<00:02:24.070> all<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> lasers<00:02:24.780> okay<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.190> van<00:02:27.190> fleet

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
with all the lasers okay just van fleet

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430 
with all the lasers okay just van fleet
drops<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.820> combo<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.290> that's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
drops a combo I don't know if that's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.170 
drops a combo I don't know if that's
even<00:02:29.560> possible<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.310> think<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.640> he<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.030> kind

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
even possible I think it is he just kind

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
even possible I think it is he just kind
of<00:02:31.209> drop<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.540> oh<00:02:31.720> he<00:02:32.140> does<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> five<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> pickup

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
of drop it oh he does the five a pickup

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
of drop it oh he does the five a pickup
i<00:02:33.370> think<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> 5p<00:02:34.000> pickup<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.360> easily<00:02:34.630> better

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
i think the 5p pickup is easily better

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.840 
i think the 5p pickup is easily better
but<00:02:34.989> whatever<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.920> safer<00:02:36.190> he<00:02:36.370> has<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.610> get<00:02:36.700> this

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
but whatever is safer he has to get this

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.410 
but whatever is safer he has to get this
