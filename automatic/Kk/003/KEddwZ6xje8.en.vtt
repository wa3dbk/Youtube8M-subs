because we had one fabricated a a couple

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.080 
because we had one fabricated a a couple
years<00:00:29.939> ago<00:00:30.349> for<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> hydra-matic<00:00:32.040> skid<00:00:32.790> steer

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
years ago for a hydra-matic skid steer

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.350 
years ago for a hydra-matic skid steer
and<00:00:33.269> they<00:00:33.330> don't<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:34.699> well<00:00:35.699> actually<00:00:35.970> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and they don't have the well actually it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.810 
and they don't have the well actually it
was<00:00:36.449> for<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> forks<00:00:37.280> because<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> Forks<00:00:38.640> just

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
was for the forks because it Forks just

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.799 
was for the forks because it Forks just
slide<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.650> then<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:41.549> spear<00:00:42.479> that<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.690> had

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
slide off and then the spear that we had

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
slide off and then the spear that we had
made<00:00:43.049> was<00:00:43.769> actually<00:00:44.159> to<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.430> slide<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.659> where

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
made was actually to go slide on where

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.619 
made was actually to go slide on where
the<00:00:45.960> forks<00:00:46.290> go<00:00:46.850> they<00:00:47.850> kicked<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.180> corks<00:00:48.449> off

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the forks go they kicked the corks off

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.460 
the forks go they kicked the corks off
and<00:00:48.869> then<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.049> slide<00:00:49.290> this<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:51.350> pick<00:00:52.350> up

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
and then you slide this on and pick up

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.000 
and then you slide this on and pick up
bales<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.170> basically<00:00:55.170> instead<00:00:55.409> of<00:00:55.680> buying<00:00:55.830> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
bales so basically instead of buying a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
bales so basically instead of buying a
new<00:00:56.159> bail<00:00:56.430> spear<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.750> sleeve<00:00:58.110> which<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.619> not

exactly<00:00:59.159> sure<00:00:59.369> but<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:00:59.909> it's<00:01:00.260> 70<00:01:01.260> 80

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:01.439

about 50 bucks so I'll slide it on for

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:32.920 
about 50 bucks so I'll slide it on for
you<00:01:12.330> guys<00:01:12.360> here

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.840 

that's<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.230> here

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
that's pretty much it now we're here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.220

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
spear is basically all it is is a plate

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
spear is basically all it is is a plate
then<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.410> have<00:01:46.650> an<00:01:46.770> angle<00:01:47.100> iron<00:01:47.250> welded<00:01:47.970> on

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
then you have an angle iron welded on

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.610 
then you have an angle iron welded on
the<00:01:48.180> top<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:50.870> down<00:01:51.870> here<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> same<00:01:52.560> thing

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the top and down here is the same thing

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.260 
the top and down here is the same thing
your<00:01:55.620> plate<00:01:56.160> comes<00:01:56.430> down<00:01:56.700> here

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
your plate comes down here

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620 
your plate comes down here
and<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.870> have<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.110> angle<00:01:58.470> underneath<00:01:59.630> with

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and you have your angle underneath with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
and you have your angle underneath with
these<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.260> actually<00:02:01.500> cement<00:02:01.800> steaks<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
these are actually cement steaks that we

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.610 
these are actually cement steaks that we
have<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.290> why<00:02:04.470> they

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
have we had there so that's why they

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.090 
have we had there so that's why they
have<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.830> holes<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.220> them<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.690> then<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
have the holes in them and then this is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.490 
have the holes in them and then this is
your<00:02:08.250> spear<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> sleeve

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
your spear then you have the sleeve

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.520 
your spear then you have the sleeve
welded<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.310> top<00:02:11.520> angle<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:12.810> braces<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
welded on the top angle with braces and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
welded on the top angle with braces and
then<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.740> whole<00:02:13.950> top<00:02:14.250> angle<00:02:14.910> iron<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.540> top

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
then this whole top angle iron up on top

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.490 
then this whole top angle iron up on top
that's<00:02:16.740> four<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.400> braces<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.200> cannot

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that's four little braces so that cannot

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.540 
that's four little braces so that cannot
twist<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.080> rip<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> whole<00:02:22.770> angle<00:02:23.190> iron<00:02:23.340> off

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
twist and rip the whole angle iron off

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.000 
twist and rip the whole angle iron off
because<00:02:23.850> there<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.470> decent<00:02:25.470> amount<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
because there is a decent amount of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.030 
because there is a decent amount of
stress<00:02:26.400> there<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.010> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
stress there and then this is what I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.380 
stress there and then this is what I
made<00:02:29.430> right<00:02:29.880> here<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.239> grey<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.100> see

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
made right here the grey and you can see

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.240 
made right here the grey and you can see
there's<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.600> bottom<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.320> quarter-inch

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
there's the bottom just quarter-inch

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.280 
there's the bottom just quarter-inch
plates<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.420> two<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:37.019> two<00:02:37.370> steel<00:02:39.290> tubing

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
plates this is two by two steel tubing

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.009 
plates this is two by two steel tubing
and<00:02:40.560> there's<00:02:41.250> angle<00:02:41.700> iron<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.180> then<00:02:42.840> this

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and there's angle iron and then this

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.680 
and there's angle iron and then this
angle<00:02:43.260> iron<00:02:43.560> sticks<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> can

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
angle iron sticks out so that it can

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.660 
angle iron sticks out so that it can
slide<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.519> then<00:02:47.760> wear<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> top<00:02:49.670> three

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
slide on and then wear the top three

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.610 
slide on and then wear the top three
point<00:02:50.940> goes<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.870> actually<00:02:52.019> angle<00:02:52.470> iron

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
point goes in it's actually angle iron

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.830 
point goes in it's actually angle iron
to<00:02:52.890> there's<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> little<00:02:53.489> England<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.330> there

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
to there's a little England in there

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.009 
to there's a little England in there
just<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.200> strength<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.720> stop<00:02:57.720> sit<00:02:57.900> down

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
just for strength and stop sit down

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.710 
just for strength and stop sit down
there<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.850> would<00:02:59.910> only<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.269> welded<00:03:00.630> on

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
there if not it would only be welded on

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
there if not it would only be welded on
the<00:03:00.840> inside<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.290> outside<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.310> gives<00:03:02.550> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the inside and outside and that gives it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.259 
the inside and outside and that gives it
the<00:03:03.450> weld<00:03:03.660> up<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.050> weld<00:03:04.230> down<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the weld up here and weld down here and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.390 
the weld up here and weld down here and
on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> back<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.920> has<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> little

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
on the back and then it has a little

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.580 
on the back and then it has a little
three<00:03:09.300> inch<00:03:09.480> by<00:03:09.660> three<00:03:09.900> inch<00:03:09.930> quarter<00:03:10.440> inch

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
three inch by three inch quarter inch

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.940 
three inch by three inch quarter inch
braces<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.970> actually<00:03:12.300> works<00:03:12.450> pretty<00:03:12.660> nice

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
braces and it actually works pretty nice

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.000 
braces and it actually works pretty nice
for<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.130> we<00:03:14.280> need<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.769> since<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.860> did

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
for what we need it for and since I did

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.410 
for what we need it for and since I did
it<00:03:17.040> myself<00:03:17.570> then<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.640> lot<00:03:20.820> cheaper<00:03:20.850> than

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
it myself then it's a lot cheaper than

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.740 
it myself then it's a lot cheaper than
having<00:03:21.690> someone<00:03:21.989> else<00:03:22.200> paint<00:03:22.500> make<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.820> it

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
having someone else paint make it and it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.479 
having someone else paint make it and it
works<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.200> not<00:03:25.320> exactly<00:03:25.739> perfect<00:03:25.980> there's

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
works it's not exactly perfect there's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.110 
works it's not exactly perfect there's
some<00:03:26.610> flaws<00:03:27.290> like<00:03:28.290> where<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.940> bottom<00:03:29.940> three

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
some flaws like where the bottom three

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.180 
some flaws like where the bottom three
points<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.570> tell<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.590> angles<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.160> I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
points you can tell it angles back I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.990 
points you can tell it angles back I
didn't<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.700> any

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
didn't have any

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.650 
didn't have any
a<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.840> 2x2<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:35.700> stick<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.090> there<00:03:36.240> when<00:03:36.360> i<00:03:36.390> weld

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
a more 2x2 to stick in there when i weld

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.170 
a more 2x2 to stick in there when i weld
it<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.140> wouldn't<00:03:37.350> bend<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.310> that's<00:03:39.000> just

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
it so it wouldn't bend in that's just

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.610 
it so it wouldn't bend in that's just
from<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.360> heat<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.840> welding<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
from the heat of the welding and the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220 
from the heat of the welding and the
holes<00:03:43.860> up<00:03:44.130> here<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.670> exactly<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.570> mean<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.050> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
holes up here on exactly I mean this is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.660 
holes up here on exactly I mean this is
starting<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> get<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.040> tell<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
starting to get you can tell it's a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.660 
starting to get you can tell it's a
little<00:03:48.450> bit<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> angle<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:49.950> as<00:03:50.490> long

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
little bit of a angle to it but as long

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.590 
little bit of a angle to it but as long
as<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.850> can<00:03:50.970> get<00:03:51.030> your<00:03:51.150> pin<00:03:51.390> through<00:03:51.570> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
as you can get your pin through the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.390 
as you can get your pin through the
holes<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:54.690> end<00:03:55.100> antler<00:03:56.100> there<00:03:56.280> I'll

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
holes a little end antler there I'll

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.290 
holes a little end antler there I'll
make<00:03:56.580> up<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:56.790> it

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
make up for it

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.930 
make up for it
guy<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.690> used<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.290> Lincoln<00:03:58.620> MIG<00:03:58.800> welder<00:03:59.160> -<00:03:59.490> 20<00:03:59.760> min

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
guy I used a Lincoln MIG welder - 20 min

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.699 
guy I used a Lincoln MIG welder - 20 min
welder<00:04:00.270> at<00:04:00.390> school<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:04.590> can

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
welder at school for this and you can

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.130 
welder at school for this and you can
see<00:04:04.890> they're<00:04:05.160> not<00:04:05.310> too<00:04:05.520> bad<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.780> mean<00:04:07.020> this

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
see they're not too bad just I mean this

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.750 
see they're not too bad just I mean this
isn't<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.760> best<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.459> see<00:04:11.640> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
isn't the best but you can see the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.060 
isn't the best but you can see the
little<00:04:11.930> little<00:04:12.930> hooky<00:04:13.170> DS<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:15.690> yeah<00:04:16.620> that's

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
little little hooky DS and yeah that's

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.210 
little little hooky DS and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:17.250> much<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.489> for<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.910> thing<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:20.070> you

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
guys want to want to know the design for

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.830 
guys want to want to know the design for
this<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:24.140> can<00:04:25.730> message<00:04:26.730> me<00:04:26.910> or<00:04:27.060> whatever<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.780> I

this I can message me or whatever and I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.120 
this I can message me or whatever and I
can<00:04:28.020> get<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:29.360> actual<00:04:30.800> dimensions<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.980> it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
can get you the actual dimensions of it

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.350 
can get you the actual dimensions of it
and<00:04:32.250> everything<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:32.640> I'm<00:04:32.910> not<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.270> go

and everything but I'm not going to go
through<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.690> because<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> take

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
through that because it's going to take

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
through that because it's going to take
forever<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.490> don't<00:04:35.850> really<00:04:36.150> know<00:04:36.330> I'm<00:04:36.450> on
