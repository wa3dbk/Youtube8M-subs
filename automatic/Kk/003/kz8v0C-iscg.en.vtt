00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.549
 and what happened is worth today I want to bring you 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.740
 the champion's faith guide that just 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.260
 leave today and well I have to tell you that 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.300
 you give a kind of heel of agreement not 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.400
 that does not have a CC, it only has a small 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.010
 slow but has many more resources than 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.930
 Heel win when you know that 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.030
 he also has a closer with a silence 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.590
 this one does not have it but it is true that 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.440
 have a plan with which we can release 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.660
 all the bus we have and then leave 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.039
 since good and I tell you the champion is a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.289
 Authentic madness does not become invisible 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.739
 but with the shadows it has a lot 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.600
 game you already know what is needed 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.890
 goal to jump he does not need 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 be able to jump any kind of world 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.390
 both to attack and to defend 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 I already tell you in mid I do not see it because 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.090
 It has stc so good but in jungle it's 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.860
 an authentic beast with the w and the e us 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.809
 let's put the umbrella and change the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.880
 aee that has a very low lung we are going to 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.480
 clean the jungle super fast and over 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.489
 We will take rune if there are masters more 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.150
 oriented to the bench that makes the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.980
 own jungle yes 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.540
 but I'm doing great 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.010
 which fewer deaths are issued 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.020
 15 that's how good the champion is 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.250
 really cool or he left it up to the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.750
 right a video explaining 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.790
 each and every one of the skills of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.100
 set but good basically that's it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.410
 dedicate to play with the shadow to throw it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 shuriken to stick to turn on itself 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.880
 same master's degree we are going to take a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.290
 2109 trying to catch all the theft of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 life we â€‹â€‹can and the armor that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.490
 we can even though we go to jungle are what 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.290
 essential is to be all the time of the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.970
 lines trying to pulse the trying 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 create superiorities for that instead of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.510
 bring the masters oriented to the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.360
 defense we are going to take them oriented to the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.850
 attack of runes we are going to take the red ones 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 of armor penetration the yellow 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.650
 of armor and the blue of resistance 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 magic and we are going to take the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.250
 quintessence of life flat because 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.570
 because it was already done that we concentrate to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 be more time in the lines themselves 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.080
 that in the jungle they are creating 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.970
 superiority therefore we need 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.650
 runes that help us a lot to endure 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.660
 well a gun that can keep retiring 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.240
 before doing the jungle fast because 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.860
 already with the w makes the jungle 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.220
 very very fast and clean it without losing 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.380
 a lot of life 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.850
 starting with Jungle Cesc we are going to 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 start with a cross armor and three 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.010
 portions and we're going to improve the cross to a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.630
 lantern and some xavi boots for 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.610
 to be able to do all the damage that we can 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.800
 without it hurting us much later already 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.500
 you know as a heel a brutal and ferocious and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.230
 a bloodthirsty then we're going to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.910
 Buy activity to maximize the damage 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.650
 and after that we're going to buy last 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.690
 words remember that we are a glass 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.940
 canon is worth knowing the cris we do not have 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.560
 resistance practically and we 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.300
 we based on the great damage we have 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 after that we are going to buy a 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.350
 defensive to our choice the one that most 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.640
 we like it already be a quiksilver sas 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.100
 if a sash of mercury if they have many 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.690
 cc a guardian angel if we see that the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.209
 departure is going well so that they do not kill us and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.790
 continue to give great support to the team 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.410
 when we can fall we are accused in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.000
 truth of death for me is my 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.800
 favorite because we to remove a cc 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 Manna gives us life to be true that we do not 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.570
 let's use but between the life that we 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.459
 gives the magical assistance that he gives us and the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.290
 passive by hand really for me is the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.819
 optimal object some game that goes to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.790
 relatively balanced 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.439
 and good to finish I tell you purchases 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.819
 do I get pissed off when the 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.200
 champion believed that it was a kind of 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.730
 sack well done but good do not have 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.969
 nothing to do with sack is a kind of 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 heel oriented to the gun that today to putear 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.170
 alumnio to me I liked me 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.909
 I'm going to buy I still do not have it but 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.219
 Well sincerely the champion is a 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.019
 authentic barbarity and swells become 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.980
 blocks and sales because nothing I hope that you 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.980
 have liked and until next time
