hi this is Brad Linder from Lulu heating
and<00:00:02.340> today<00:00:02.820> I'm<00:00:03.060> unboxing<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.840> net<00:00:04.500> top<00:00:04.740> with

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
and today I'm unboxing a net top with

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.089 
and today I'm unboxing a net top with
Nvidia<00:00:06.029> ion<00:00:06.270> graphics<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.519> natok<00:00:08.519> from

asrock and was sent to me by the folks
at<00:00:13.950> Nvidia<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.330> could<00:00:15.480> test<00:00:15.630> out<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
at Nvidia so I could test out the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.890

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.730 
that it can have a full 1080p blu-ray
content<00:01:47.680> it's<00:01:48.250> got<00:01:48.399> instant<00:01:48.850> boot<00:01:49.740> it's

described<00:01:51.070> as<00:01:51.220> silent<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.740> yeah<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.070> let's<00:01:54.220> go

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
described as silent and yeah so let's go

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.050 
described as silent and yeah so let's go
ahead<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.550> open<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.940> up<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.950> box<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:01.030> been

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
ahead and open it up this box have been

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.150 
ahead and open it up this box have been
opened<00:02:01.660> before<00:02:01.780> looks<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.649> it's<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.830> review

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
opened before looks like it's a review

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.050 
opened before looks like it's a review
unit<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:04.570> example<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.729> power<00:02:06.729> cables

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
unit so for example the power cables

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.310 
unit so for example the power cables
just<00:02:07.149> hanging<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.630> top<00:02:07.750> there<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.019> might

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
just hanging out on top there so might

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.530 
just hanging out on top there so might
not<00:02:08.440> look<00:02:08.560> exactly<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:09.130> what<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:10.239> would<00:02:10.390> get

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
not look exactly like what you would get

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.980 
not look exactly like what you would get
in<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.720> store

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.360 

these<00:02:18.990> are<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> items<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.650> find<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.190> box

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
these are the items we find in the box

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:31.960 
these are the items we find in the box
so<00:02:22.010> first<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> past<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> software<00:02:31.709> is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
so first off is past the software is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.520 
so first off is past the software is

typical<00:03:55.410> netbook<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.420> haven't<00:03:57.420> waited<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:57.870> I

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
typical netbook I haven't waited so I

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.410 
typical netbook I haven't waited so I
can't<00:03:58.079> say<00:03:58.170> exactly<00:03:58.260> how<00:03:58.739> heavy<00:03:59.069> but<00:03:59.310> but<00:04:00.299> it

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
can't say exactly how heavy but but it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.610 
can't say exactly how heavy but but it
is<00:04:00.540> really<00:04:00.930> small<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.870> packs<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.290> lot<00:04:04.440> in

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
is really small and it packs a lot in

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.150 
is really small and it packs a lot in
you've<00:04:04.890> got<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> VGA<00:04:05.430> port<00:04:05.810> HDMI<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:07.590> two<00:04:07.799> three

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
you've got a VGA port HDMI one two three

on<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.799> front<00:04:18.560> basically<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.769> power

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
on the front basically just a power

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.420 
on the front basically just a power
button<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:21.470> DVD<00:04:22.470> drive

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430

and<00:04:26.520> while<00:04:27.520> we're<00:04:27.790> here<00:04:28.300> before<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:30.509> powered

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
and while we're here before we powered

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.150 
and while we're here before we powered
up<00:04:31.660> raising<00:04:31.960> let's<00:04:32.380> take<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.530> look<00:04:32.740> at<00:04:33.009> the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
up raising let's take a look at the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:53.189 
up raising let's take a look at the
inside<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.860> so<00:04:51.630> here<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.720> can<00:04:52.810> sort<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.080> see

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
inside and so here you can sort of see

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.770 
inside and so here you can sort of see
what's<00:04:53.350> going<00:04:53.410> on<00:04:53.650> on<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> inside<00:04:54.449> there<00:04:55.449> is

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
what's going on on the inside there is

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.020 
what's going on on the inside there is
there<00:04:56.380> are<00:04:56.410> two<00:04:56.530> RAM<00:04:57.370> slots<00:04:57.729> they're<00:04:57.910> both

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
there are two RAM slots they're both

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.140 
there are two RAM slots they're both
occupied<00:04:58.419> at<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.660> moment<00:04:59.910> looks<00:05:00.910> like<00:05:01.030> you'll

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
occupied at the moment looks like you'll

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.969 
occupied at the moment looks like you'll
probably<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.630> remove<00:05:01.960> some<00:05:02.320> more<00:05:02.650> parts

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
probably have to remove some more parts

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.860 
probably have to remove some more parts
if<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.160> want<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.400> actually<00:05:03.550> get<00:05:04.419> at<00:05:04.630> them

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
if you want to actually get at them

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.240 
if you want to actually get at them
nothing<00:05:05.229> here<00:05:05.440> just<00:05:05.470> slides<00:05:05.830> out<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.160> way

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
nothing here just slides out of the way

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.710 
nothing here just slides out of the way
so<00:05:06.310> replacing<00:05:06.970> or<00:05:07.090> upgrading<00:05:07.120> around<00:05:07.630> is

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
so replacing or upgrading around is

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.980 
so replacing or upgrading around is
going<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.960> take<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.620> little<00:05:08.830> bit<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:09.070> work<00:05:09.220> um

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
going to take a little bit of work um

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.320 
going to take a little bit of work um
there<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.260> fan<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> even<00:05:13.090> though<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
there is a fan so even though the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.790 
there is a fan so even though the
operation<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.780> described<00:05:14.110> as<00:05:14.289> silent<00:05:14.740> you

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
operation is described as silent you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.469 
operation is described as silent you
might<00:05:14.949> hear<00:05:15.160> something

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
might hear something

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.689 
might hear something
but<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.199> know<00:05:17.289> with<00:05:17.410> Nvidia<00:05:17.800> ion<00:05:18.010> graphics<00:05:18.610> I

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
but you know with Nvidia ion graphics I

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.339 
but you know with Nvidia ion graphics I
would<00:05:18.789> imagine<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.120> would<00:05:19.240> be<00:05:19.449> helpful<00:05:20.260> to

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
would imagine that would be helpful to

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.279 
would imagine that would be helpful to
have<00:05:20.470> a<00:05:20.919> fan<00:05:21.490> over<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.180> CPU<00:05:22.479> itself<00:05:22.630> is<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.169> a

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
have a fan over the CPU itself is just a

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.500 
have a fan over the CPU itself is just a
heatsink<00:05:23.889> it<00:05:24.070> looks<00:05:24.250> like<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:28.270> that's<00:05:28.419> pretty

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
heatsink it looks like and that's pretty

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.480 
heatsink it looks like and that's pretty
much<00:05:28.599> it<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.229> DVD<00:05:29.800> drive<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.190> hanging<00:05:30.430> out

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
much it the DVD drive is hanging out

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.159 
much it the DVD drive is hanging out
here<00:05:30.729> on<00:05:30.820> top<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.240> it's<00:05:31.330> kind<00:05:31.539> of<00:05:31.570> blocking<00:05:31.990> our

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
here on top so it's kind of blocking our

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.620 
here on top so it's kind of blocking our
view<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.590> what's<00:05:32.830> further<00:05:33.370> down<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.849> at<00:05:34.510> this

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
view of what's further down and at this

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.370 
view of what's further down and at this
point<00:05:34.840> I<00:05:34.930> don't<00:05:35.110> feel<00:05:35.260> like<00:05:35.440> taking<00:05:36.220> that<00:05:36.550> out

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
point I don't feel like taking that out

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
point I don't feel like taking that out
but<00:05:38.380> underneath<00:05:38.650> there<00:05:38.979> should<00:05:39.070> be<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.160> hard

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
but underneath there should be a hard

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.710 
but underneath there should be a hard
drive<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:41.220> your<00:05:42.220> Wi-Fi<00:05:42.610> components<00:05:43.330> wait

does<00:05:43.840> this<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:44.080> Wi-Fi<00:05:44.409> and<00:05:44.770> get<00:05:44.889> as<00:05:45.010> Wi-Fi

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
does this have Wi-Fi and get as Wi-Fi

does this have Wi-Fi and get as Wi-Fi
your<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.330> Box<00:05:46.510> ago<00:05:46.720> actually<00:05:47.710> read<00:05:47.830> the

your the Box ago actually read the
