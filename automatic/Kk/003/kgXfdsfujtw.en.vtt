00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
of thick
it<00:01:50.759> wasn't<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.479> bad<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.869> couldn't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it wasn't like so bad that I couldn't

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
it wasn't like so bad that I couldn't
work<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
work with it but you know it was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030 
work with it but you know it was
definitely<00:01:54.210> more<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> thick<00:01:54.869> side<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
definitely more on the thick side and it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490 
definitely more on the thick side and it
was<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.399> shiny<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:57.270> itself<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
was very shiny by itself I think that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.399 
was very shiny by itself I think that
this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.420> regular<00:02:00.420> nail<00:02:01.170> polish

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this is like a regular nail polish

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.319 
this is like a regular nail polish
honestly<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.460> nothing<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.180> my

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
honestly there was nothing in all my

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.480 
honestly there was nothing in all my
testing<00:02:03.899> there's<00:02:04.590> nothing<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
testing there's nothing that I have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
testing there's nothing that I have
found<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.329> suggest<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
found that would suggest that this is

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.160 
found that would suggest that this is
different<00:02:07.530> than<00:02:07.890> any<00:02:08.190> other<00:02:08.340> nail<00:02:08.729> polish

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
different than any other nail polish

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
different than any other nail polish

okay<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.490> set<00:02:44.700> comes<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.600> primer<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
okay so the set comes with a primer the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.010 
okay so the set comes with a primer the
the<00:02:48.090> color<00:02:48.330> which<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> buy

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the color which you have to buy

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870 
the color which you have to buy
separately<00:02:49.350> which<00:02:49.620> kind<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> sucks

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
separately which kind of sucks

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.340 
separately which kind of sucks
and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.690> glaze<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:54.030> primer<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.840> dries

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and then the glaze the primer it dries

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.930 
and then the glaze the primer it dries
really<00:02:55.740> really<00:02:56.010> fast<00:02:56.220> which<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.580> really<00:02:56.790> nice

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
really really fast which is really nice

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.480 
really really fast which is really nice
but<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> was<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.980> watery

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
but it was like really really watery

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.390 
but it was like really really watery
thin<00:03:00.120> texture<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.959> I'm<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.350> sure<00:03:01.650> what

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
thin texture so I'm not really sure what

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.250 
thin texture so I'm not really sure what
it's<00:03:02.550> supposed<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> do<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.390> no<00:03:03.630> claims

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it's supposed to do there is no claims

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.130 
it's supposed to do there is no claims
anywhere<00:03:04.740> on<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> box<00:03:05.220> about<00:03:06.120> what<00:03:06.390> exactly

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
anywhere on the box about what exactly

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.320 
anywhere on the box about what exactly
the<00:03:07.440> primer<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.950> supposed<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.340> do<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.850> think

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the primer is supposed to do I think

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.480 
the primer is supposed to do I think
it's<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.959> regular<00:03:10.320> base<00:03:10.500> coat<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.040> really

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
it's just a regular base coat I really

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
it's just a regular base coat I really
really<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.709> don't<00:03:13.709> know<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.510> this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510

whole<00:03:15.750> time<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.410> had<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> very<00:03:16.980> hard<00:03:17.310> time

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
whole time I have had a very hard time

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.660 
whole time I have had a very hard time
figuring<00:03:17.820> out<00:03:18.830> why<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.130> supposed<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> be

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
figuring out why this is supposed to be

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.520 
figuring out why this is supposed to be
special<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.360> don't<00:03:22.230> know

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
