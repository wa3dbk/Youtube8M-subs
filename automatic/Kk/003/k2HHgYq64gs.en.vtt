00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 and I am what is the purpose of my life 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.480
 of my life on this planet 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 many go through life unsatisfied 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.110
 without a goal looking for a canvas in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.330
 white is waiting for us to paint 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.910
 a drawing in our purpose what 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 it means all this once it was said 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 that there was a great void in all 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.300
 we look for many things to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.340
 fill us friends fads falsehoods 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 fornication and the facade of the drug and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.890
 your fantasies but follow me follow me up 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.019
 the edge of an abyss where very inside and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.659
 very deeply we all know that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.580
 something is missing from the moment that God 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.650
 brought man into existence he did 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.879
 with his own hands and his own image 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.119
 his plan was for him and the man 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.119
 they were one 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.030
 the creator and his creation living together 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.540
 together in a beautiful harmony sounds 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.530
 perfect is not like that then what happened the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.200
 sin sin confused us sin 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.330
 opened this emptiness the sin away from us 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.780
 our friends sin led us away from 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.090
 he and for many centuries we the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.980
 human beings we have tried to make a 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.200
 bridge in this growing gap with 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.030
 philosophies and religions often 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.740
 we look for more solutions but the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 divisions were made many and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.450
 they installed so much in us that god 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.740
 we shook and it seems that humanity 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.660
 was condemned until one day a 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.330
 child was born in the city ​​of bell in 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.910
 our savior Jesus Christ our 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.660
 sir and you will find the child wrapped in 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.660
 diapers lying in a manger but this 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.210
 he was not an ordinary child he became a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.369
 boy then a man and then a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.890
 preacher and led a crowd of 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.259
 people with really radical teachings 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.100
 and extraordinary as he loves your 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.660
 Enemies loves those who curse you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.340
 presents them had another cheek is the most 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.259
 great teacher that has existed he was not 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.090
 an ordinary preacher as you see the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.920
 the price of sin is death but the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.600
 God's gift is eternal life through 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.150
 of Jesus Christ who paid for our 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.280
 sins he had to pay the price 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.490
 they put nails in their related and 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.340
 denied they hung it high and nailed it in 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.430
 a cross for you and for me more than two 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.950
 a thousand years denied the son to the son of god 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.530
 our lamb murdered before we 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 the world began to die and came from the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.030
 more agonizing physical deaths than a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.400
 person may suffer they put it in the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 grave of a friend for three days and his 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.570
 mother 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.970
 and for three days his disciples ran 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.710
 but thanks to the high is not like that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.530
 the story ends because three 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.920
 glorious days after jesus got up 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.590
 from the dead but this was not a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.570
 ordinary sacrifice because he gets 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.060
 turned the truth and the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.030
 life and now we have a way to father 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 through it through the cross now 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.770
 we can cross like a bridge 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.170
 that abyss caused by sin that we 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.500
 separates from him is calling us but 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.810
 we choose to go he has given us everything 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.300
 love so much loved God to the world that 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.160
 sent his only son if we just 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.900
 we believe that Jesus Christ paid this 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.600
 price jesus said the truth will be 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.209
 revealed there will be no more separation no more 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.230
 fear of death no more empty in 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.700
 our hearts now we can have 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.670
 eternal life 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.260
 God gave man a choice 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.260
 in the accept or reject it
