00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 to also take two circles one that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.960
 is going to be the face and two little ones that are going 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.570
 to be the ears we take them that remain 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.910
 more or less then we extend our 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.719
 mass and we cut the peak in the circle 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.640
 big we cut a circle now that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.730
 circle we take it to the tray of the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.730
 oven 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.230
 well we also cut two more circles 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.830
 small ones we had chosen and in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.720
 those circles with the big cutter 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.600
 We cut two circles with the cutter 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.070
 small and now with the big cutter 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.500
 what we do is cut a corner 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.500
 that's where we're going to fit it well 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.980
 Well now we're going to hit it with a little 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.840
 of water to our cookie and see how it goes 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 to stay then we hit it with a tad of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.820
 water and this we will put in the oven if 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.190
 You see that your face has stayed very 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.620
 round because directly here stretches is 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.870
 a tad down then let's do 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.270
 a few good ones, we have already taken 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.270
 from the oven our cookies with ears 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.420
 that is, still stuck to the ear what 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.730
 we had said with a little bit of water 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.430
 strike then a quick way to 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.130
 doing them is only anoint up here 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 of chocolate does not need to make faces 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.010
 or anything we put together 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.010
 that sinks in the ears 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 and this is going to be our cookie 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.480
 we hold on like this a bit until it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 dry 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.900
 if we support the blonda then they stay 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 there a little marked 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.440
 if we make a fondant bow and what 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:51.470
 we put some mini and other mickey 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.720
 good to do these little things what 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.540
 we do is instead of putting them before with 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.160
 cookies we put a dragee 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.860
 chocolate you have to be careful that you 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.200
 stick well 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.020
 Well, we've stuck two dragees 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.570
 of chocolate to a normal cookie and the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.929
 we bathe just like the previous ones once 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.180
 dry bathes that the chocolate is not 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.850
 very hot because if you do not dragee it 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.070
 we will go retire then bathe and already 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.070
 it's easier still 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.000
 Well, we have done to the whole family 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 we can also see in this we have 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.320
 made to put it a little more round already 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.750
 make a piquito and make it look more mic and 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.050
 well this is the result are very 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.060
 easy to make and give are phenomenal 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.060
 I think it's worth a try
