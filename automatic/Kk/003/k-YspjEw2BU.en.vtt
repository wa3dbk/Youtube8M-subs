00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.809
 Let's go back to it with temporary thanks 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:13.519
 The rising trend is what you are continuing in business now 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:20.270
 Selling pressure is becoming stronger 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:24.390
 It and go looking for a buying and selling point of it is this kind of flow next and previous Daily 21 days 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.860
 The moving average line gold first meeting one of the points of the king card 2 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.960
 There is one 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.390
 Another strategy is this 10330 yen level 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.360
 Well it is Kitara beyond the here 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:46.300
 It is thought that the sale is changing because it is in a quite high place now 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.700
 So this time, I think it might be good to make a long at the second break 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 You make a loan by judgment 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.440
 Soon down 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.280
 Break long scale because it will be surveying and we will go to the high place now 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.719
 is not it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.039
 This kind of want to go Nde color in the strategy, such as going to immediately jerk After a little disconnect 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.740
 We think Fu 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:11.979
 I'm out of the top once again 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.119
 If you adjust it after aiming it, the rising trend will continue and this rising line 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:20.450
 In the vicinity 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:24.950
 I put the sea, so I'm going to put a name below this It is this high and low price 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.020
 It seems to be about 1/3 waist or so and now it may be good because it is quite 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 Because you are coming to a high place 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.710
 Also you can see that that depicts a rising wave in the handicap also nails eyeing 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:44.850
 The players are here I wish I could go with this point trend line , but around here 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.880
 I also saw here but in consultation 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 We bought in this neighborhood 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:58.350
 In I was a little deep it is as a stop loss but in this area 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.090
 In this, if I make a little more adjustment, I'm going to aim out a little more Mashisu 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.050
 It was entered here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 a 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.210
 Shi those reaction of this high man was the trail who said ran away once it is and so 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.270
 I bought it here and said that I ran around here 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:17.550
 It is also voluntary but was trade 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.040
 Cordlessly bought at such a point like this 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.689
 And of the most recent wild put more is it more the number was 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.150
 You say back to me Somehow I'm not a guy Well how about returning to half price 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:33.340
 I want to aim 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.730
 Well, if you said that it was a little crumbling 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 here
