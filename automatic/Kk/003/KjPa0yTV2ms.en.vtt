about this figure as you're going around

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.900 
about this figure as you're going around
there's<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.340> one<00:02:57.610> particular

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
moment where your net momentum is going

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.400 
moment where your net momentum is going
to<00:03:00.670> change<00:03:00.820> completely<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.550> meant<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
to change completely and you meant to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.440 
to change completely and you meant to
both<00:03:05.410> be<00:03:05.620> where<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.860> reverse<00:03:06.100> directions<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
both be where to reverse directions the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.449 
both be where to reverse directions the
guy<00:03:07.600> can<00:03:07.870> lead<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> plant

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
guy can lead that just going to plant

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.320 
guy can lead that just going to plant
your<00:03:09.580> right<00:03:09.790> foot<00:03:10.150> once<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.670> ball<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.150> going

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
your right foot once the ball is going

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.120 
your right foot once the ball is going
to<00:03:13.420> be<00:03:13.480> pulled<00:03:13.810> along<00:03:13.930> by<00:03:14.110> your<00:03:14.860> hand<00:03:15.040> behind

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
so just be aware as a practicing it that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.570 
so just be aware as a practicing it that
there's<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.870> there's<00:03:22.870> moving<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.650> way<00:03:23.680> stop

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
there's the there's moving one way stop

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.870 
there's the there's moving one way stop
move<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.600> other<00:03:25.690> way<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.520> want<00:03:27.670> those

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
move the other way and you want those

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.740 
move the other way and you want those
motions<00:03:28.270> to<00:03:28.540> flow<00:03:29.500> into<00:03:29.710> each<00:03:29.890> others<00:03:30.160> as

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
motions to flow into each others as

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.490 
motions to flow into each others as
easily<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.870> naturally<00:03:31.960> as<00:03:32.290> possible<00:03:33.420> anyway

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
easily and naturally as possible anyway

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.990 
easily and naturally as possible anyway
once<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.620> get<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:35.770> chance<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.070> get<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.280> working

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
once you get a chance to get it working

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.930 
once you get a chance to get it working
right<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:38.020> looks<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:48.580> has<00:03:48.640> been
