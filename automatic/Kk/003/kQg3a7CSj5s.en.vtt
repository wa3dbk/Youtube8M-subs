 choose one of the servers you can have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.480

 terminate the accelerator download 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.590
 site is important to do this 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 because the case of the site keeps in the air 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.859
 After a few seconds, open the button. 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.329

 I melt the pilot 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.970
 This part is very simple so I will not 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.450
 hit a lot on top of that ok you go 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 need two problems a rare one and the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 another is the virtual drive with it's cousin 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 game in the case was the storage drive 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
