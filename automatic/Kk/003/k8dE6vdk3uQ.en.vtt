servers

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.400 
servers

who<00:02:16.720> made<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.110> will<00:02:18.099> we<00:02:18.250> said<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.330> he<00:02:19.510> plans

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
who made this will we said that he plans

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.720 
who made this will we said that he plans
on<00:02:19.989> coding<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.800> while<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:21.580> not

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
on coding it for a while so it's not

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.210 
on coding it for a while so it's not
like<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> perfect<00:02:22.480> gist<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.410> will<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:24.010> go

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
like a perfect gist that will just go

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.509 
like a perfect gist that will just go
away<00:02:24.400> once<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.180> 1.2<00:02:25.720> update<00:02:25.870> comes<00:02:26.349> out<00:02:26.530> so

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
away once the 1.2 update comes out so

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.790 
away once the 1.2 update comes out so
that's<00:02:27.670> basically<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:28.840> how<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> hone

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
that's basically it that's how to hone

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.680 
that's basically it that's how to hone
in<00:02:29.950> your<00:02:30.099> server<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.640> think<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.269> went<00:02:31.480> wrong

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
in your server I think what went wrong

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.170 
in your server I think what went wrong
was<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.290> didn't<00:02:32.650> register<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.670> register

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
was I didn't register like the register

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.280 
was I didn't register like the register
it<00:02:34.480> didn't<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.830> bottom<00:02:36.310> document<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
it didn't do this the bottom document so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.839 
it didn't do this the bottom document so
just<00:02:38.290> let<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.650> run<00:02:38.920> click<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> register

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
just let that run click the register

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.059 
just let that run click the register
button<00:02:39.879> let<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.390> run<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.590> should<00:02:41.799> be<00:02:41.920> it

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
button let it run and that should be it

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.410 
button let it run and that should be it
