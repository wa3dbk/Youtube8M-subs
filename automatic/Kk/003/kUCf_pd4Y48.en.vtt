you<00:00:41.610> work<00:00:42.000> together<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.590> apparently<00:00:43.590> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you work together because apparently in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
you work together because apparently in
some<00:00:43.920> countries<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.730> can't<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> cuz<00:00:45.660> i

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
some countries you can't get this cuz i

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.029 
some countries you can't get this cuz i
heard<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> murphy<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> can't<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
heard in a murphy you can't get this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
heard in a murphy you can't get this
either<00:00:50.090> then<00:00:51.090> obviously<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.110> zombrex

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
either then obviously is the zombrex

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
either then obviously is the zombrex
well<00:00:53.850> dead<00:00:54.059> rising<00:00:54.420> case<00:00:54.660> which<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.500> quite

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
well dead rising case which is quite

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
well dead rising case which is quite
nice<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.070> nice<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:57.300> feels<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.020> bit

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
nice it's nice now it feels a bit

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.010 
nice it's nice now it feels a bit
cheaper<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.760> other<00:01:00.120> dead<00:01:00.270> rising<00:01:00.600> case<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
cheaper to the other dead rising case of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.490 
cheaper to the other dead rising case of
rocks<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.739> dead<00:01:01.949> rising<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:03.320> which<00:01:04.320> i'll

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
rocks about dead rising one which i'll

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
rocks about dead rising one which i'll
probably<00:01:04.890> chart<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.640> paris<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> end

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
probably chart in paris on at the end

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.870 
probably chart in paris on at the end
this<00:01:06.390> video<00:01:06.689> yeah<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.340> I've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.640> days

of<00:01:38.850> I've<00:01:39.750> watch<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> list<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.650> got<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
of I've watch the list it's got the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.499 
of I've watch the list it's got the
making<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.670> pretty<00:01:41.909> good<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.240> only

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
making of it's pretty good it's only

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.319 
making of it's pretty good it's only
about<00:01:42.750> 40<00:01:43.409> minutes<00:01:43.590> long<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:45.149> too

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
about 40 minutes long not not too

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.950 
about 40 minutes long not not too
brilliant<00:01:46.759> nothing<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> disc<00:01:48.540> come

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
brilliant nothing is that the disc come

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
brilliant nothing is that the disc come
out<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:49.350> easier<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:50.040> most<00:01:50.490> other

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
out a lot easier than all most other

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.069 
out a lot easier than all most other
metal<00:01:51.090> cases<00:01:53.270> yeah<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.659> let's<00:01:54.810> put<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
metal cases yeah so let's put that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.289 
metal cases yeah so let's put that
they're<00:01:57.770> dead<00:01:58.770> rise<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> turn<00:01:59.369> itself<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.570> me

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
they're dead rise and turn itself is me

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
they're dead rise and turn itself is me
yeah<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.600> good<00:02:04.079> game<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:04.860> say<00:02:05.070> it's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
yeah it's a good game I would say it's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.779 
yeah it's a good game I would say it's
probably<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.890> more<00:02:08.009> enjoyable<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
probably a bit more enjoyable was the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
probably a bit more enjoyable was the
first<00:02:09.030> when<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> was<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> big<00:02:09.629> fan<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.080> first

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
first when I was a big fan of the first

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.420 
first when I was a big fan of the first
one<00:02:10.560> but

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
one but

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.179 
one but
other<00:02:12.209> line<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.989> pretty<00:02:13.230> good<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:16.500> gameplay

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
other line it's pretty good in gameplay

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.839 
other line it's pretty good in gameplay
wise<00:02:17.670> co-op<00:02:18.299> is<00:02:18.510> brilliant<00:02:19.019> but<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:20.459> could<00:02:20.700> be

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
wise co-op is brilliant but it could be

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.179 
wise co-op is brilliant but it could be
improved<00:02:21.150> especially<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.260> online<00:02:22.409> sometimes

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
improved especially be online sometimes

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.770 
improved especially be online sometimes
