00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
pattern around the edges now I really

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.800 
pattern around the edges now I really
like<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.690> fact<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.770> gold<00:02:57.310> pops<00:02:58.120> off<00:02:58.570> of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
like the fact that the gold pops off of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.720 
like the fact that the gold pops off of
the<00:02:58.870> blue<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.950> doesn't<00:03:00.220> look<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the blue it doesn't look like it on the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.460 
the blue it doesn't look like it on the
red<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.750> would<00:03:01.930> definitely<00:03:02.080> recommend

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
red but I would definitely recommend

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.400 
red but I would definitely recommend
getting<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.760> blue<00:03:04.000> over<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.630> red<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.230> had

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
getting the blue over the red if you had

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.270 
getting the blue over the red if you had
to<00:03:05.560> choose<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.130> got<00:03:07.090> both<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.170> if<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:09.040> had<00:03:09.160> to

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
to choose I got both but if you had to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
to choose I got both but if you had to
choose<00:03:09.520> go<00:03:10.300> for<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.570> blue<00:03:10.780> definitely<00:03:13.320> so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
choose go for the blue definitely so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.070 
choose go for the blue definitely so
this<00:03:14.950> deck<00:03:15.220> handles<00:03:15.940> very<00:03:16.210> nicely<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.870> does

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
this deck handles very nicely it does

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.040 
this deck handles very nicely it does
clump<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.710> after<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> while<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:19.060> does<00:03:19.390> seem

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
clump and after a while it does seem

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.520 
clump and after a while it does seem
like<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.680> deck<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.550> losing<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.660> finish<00:03:22.990> but

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
like the deck as losing is finish but

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.260 
like the deck as losing is finish but
after<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.890> let<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.130> sit<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.430> about<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.820> day<00:03:25.060> as

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
after you let it sit for about a day as

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.420 
after you let it sit for about a day as
good<00:03:25.720> as<00:03:25.950> new<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.310> next<00:03:27.670> day<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.220> fact

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
good as new the next day I like the fact

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.710 
good as new the next day I like the fact
that<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.750> deck<00:03:31.990> has<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.820> gold<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:34.390> I've<00:03:34.690> said

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that the deck has the gold as I've said

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.580 
that the deck has the gold as I've said
before<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.640> overall<00:03:36.820> deck<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.720> cards<00:03:38.470> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
before so the overall deck of cards I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.410 
before so the overall deck of cards I
would<00:03:39.040> give<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.460> 3<00:03:40.000> out<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.709> 5<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:43.150> deck<00:03:43.390> is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
would give a 3 out of 5 this deck is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.260 
would give a 3 out of 5 this deck is
very<00:03:43.840> nice<00:03:44.110> looking<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.280> basically<00:03:46.150> a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
very nice looking but it's basically a

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.510 
very nice looking but it's basically a
standard<00:03:46.990> deck<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.170> cards<00:03:47.740> except<00:03:48.220> for<00:03:48.430> the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
standard deck of cards except for the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.780 
standard deck of cards except for the
fact<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.600> backs<00:03:49.959> are<00:03:50.380> Cupid<00:03:51.100> backs<00:03:51.490> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
fact that the backs are Cupid backs and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.330 
fact that the backs are Cupid backs and
they<00:03:52.060> look<00:03:52.300> very<00:03:52.500> snazzy<00:03:53.500> if<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.010> say<00:03:54.310> so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
they look very snazzy if I do say so

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.120 
they look very snazzy if I do say so
myself<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.020> thickness<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.530> feeling<00:03:56.980> of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
myself now the thickness and feeling of

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.740 
myself now the thickness and feeling of
the<00:03:57.250> cards<00:03:57.550> these<00:03:57.730> cars<00:03:57.970> are<00:03:58.090> actually<00:03:58.510> really

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the cards these cars are actually really

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.230 
the cards these cars are actually really
thin<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> air-cushion<00:04:00.250> finish<00:04:00.820> has<00:04:01.209> a

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
thin but the air-cushion finish has a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.650 
thin but the air-cushion finish has a
very<00:04:01.780> nice<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.950> grips<00:04:03.700> very<00:04:04.060> nicely<00:04:04.300> with

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
very nice it it grips very nicely with

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.650 
very nice it it grips very nicely with
these<00:04:04.810> cards<00:04:05.110> but<00:04:06.100> they<00:04:06.340> are<00:04:06.490> thin<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
these cards but they are thin so the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.120 
these cards but they are thin so the
thickness<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.140> secure<00:04:08.440> pneus<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.740> cards<00:04:09.040> I

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
thickness and secure pneus of cards I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.930 
thickness and secure pneus of cards I
don't<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.490> give<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.850> two<00:04:10.120> out<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.010> five<00:04:12.010> now

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
don't have to give a two out of five now

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.640 
don't have to give a two out of five now
the<00:04:13.000> overall<00:04:13.450> look<00:04:13.600> at<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:13.870> deck<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.290> think

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the overall look at this deck I think

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.170 
the overall look at this deck I think
they<00:04:14.860> hit<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.100> out<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.459> ballpark<00:04:15.640> with<00:04:16.090> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
they hit it out of the ballpark with the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.880 
they hit it out of the ballpark with the
blue<00:04:16.330> ones<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.959> red<00:04:17.109> ones<00:04:17.320> they<00:04:17.560> don't<00:04:17.739> look

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
blue ones the red ones they don't look

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.150 
blue ones the red ones they don't look
as<00:04:18.040> good<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.140> overall<00:04:20.260> look<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.770> this<00:04:20.919> deck

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
as good so the overall look of this deck

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.910 
as good so the overall look of this deck
I<00:04:21.340> would<00:04:21.820> give<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:23.430> 4.7<00:04:24.430> out<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.790> 5<00:04:25.060> I

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
I would give it a 4.7 out of 5 I

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.040 
I would give it a 4.7 out of 5 I
