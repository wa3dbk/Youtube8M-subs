00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello and welcome by the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 self inspirations in this video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.670
 i want to show you how to do this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.190
 Boxing makes outage paper 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.009
 they are folded out of squares for the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 I have small squares in this size 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.800
 used 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 They are about 4.5 x 45 cm and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.390
 for the big one I used 20 with 20 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.170
 you can, for example, to take off clips 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 take of jewelry or sweets 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.560
 I decorated the whole thing 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 stamp a bit 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.750
 you may still know mine 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.129
 home video because I just have the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 stems a little bit on top of that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 always here on the pages you from 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 from the side looks good and the whole 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 is quite easy to do your needs 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 three leaves for it and I'll show you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 all of you halve the whole thing once 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 long ago so once diagonally so here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.500
 then you should have a triangle 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.860
 corner down the tips here 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.860
 the corner 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 so 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.899
 and the other one too 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.140
 then you open the whole thing up and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.729
 Now fold the corner from below 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 upstairs and that's what you do again 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.940
 so you have the basis ever 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.399
 folded those are the pages that will be 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.659
 the ground and I put only times away 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:56.160
 and do the same with the others 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:02:04.009
 to fold both of them upside down 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.009
 corner down the tips 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:19.970
 and from the bottom up and fold too 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.680
 put that under the third page one 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.500
 could also take the same colors or 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.500
 patterned paper just as you want 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.020
 turn around 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.020
 keep the corners down 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.620
 open up and fall from the bottom up 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.640
 and reopen when you get the whole thing 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.610
 Decorated then you want to stamp 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.970
 here these pages the one or the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.380
 others you can choose 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.550
 I'll show it to you now without how 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.950
 it with the stamp in assisi the here 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:15.710
 and I take the brown side now 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:19.220
 infect the here at the pee the 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.640
 completely cover up so that looks 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.320
 whole from the inside then I take that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:34.490
 third part and put the pink in the 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:37.940
 pink right here shows where i am right 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:47.630
 just plug in here in between 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:52.930
 then I turn it all together and 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.930
 The brown also comes in the pink 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.550
 and the whole thing feels like that 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.910
 from the top you have the triangle 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.480
 find purely then looks at the pages and 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.720
 the whole thing looks like this from behind me 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.970
 I always do that so that I can 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.510
 Variation purely give the lower sides 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.019
 that's six that overlap him 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.230
 is a pink then a brown is then 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.410
 a pink again a pink desserts pink 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:34.720
 then brown pink then pink again brown 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.330
 pink if you fill that then keeps that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.650
 Whole with the ground if you 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.410
 you want the whole course 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 also stick with it a bit 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.580
 stick or you take and small 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.680
 tesafilm strips and sticks it just 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.850
 here under it 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.200
 I do not have that with the two 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.830
 You can do that as you can 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.950
 want 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.230
 and then the whole thing is super stable 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.880
 Is it as I said you can in all 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.250
 make sizes you just need 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.660
 square paper for that you can do that 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.250
 Decorate as you like her can you 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.330
 for example , take logitech 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.520
 and do that 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.900
 You can also use it as a basis for a 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.870
 take gift wrap 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.460
 or you put in flowers so still 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 a small flower pot or something 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.970
 you just love flowers rheingans 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.680
 Beer wants so that you can 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.890
 really nice things but do 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.360
 So take as storage and yes me 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.919
 Hope the instructions and the idea has 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.060

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.860
 let me thumb up 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.450
