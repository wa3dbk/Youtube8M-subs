00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.389
 we are on my own that I will do to you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.550
 take embo surfer your ea e sandro 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.380
 October 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.380
 then let's go to pokémon robinho mega 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:45.350
 we suspect but oh well I was introduction 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 then you must first have the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.870
 mind there is an internet connection 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.059
 then turn the wireless on 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.920
 nintendo and go on a secret gift later 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.760
 went on the gift followed 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.910
 go on says you gift you want to have 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.110
 make wireless connection you are on 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.020
 went on via serial code ci 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.119
 click on caution if they sing it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.460
 and turns off while 16 sell through a 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 evening code you will no longer be able to use 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.149
 the same serial code to receive a 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.790
 another gift against the level of charge 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.649
 of the console battery 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.750
 you want to receive the gift of life of 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:33.050
 serial code you have to wait 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.729
 because my quoted line makes a 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.590
 little shit 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:49.250
 so we'll have to wait a while 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:51.880
 also be sure not to fall quickly 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 dick 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:16.000
 ok enter the serial code make yours 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 and then enter the serial code below 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:41.460
 here he writes the pokémon pokémon 500 che 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:52.150
 this code will be humble 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:58.380
 instead that of seals that one sides 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 first 500 pokemon 500 is the apple one 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:16.750
 instead this of 497 and the surfers ur e 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.260
 then to the one bit with 503 and St. 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.810
 rocco 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.390
 I can not show you why already there 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.640
 I made these codes so I didn't 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.400
 in fact I can do as you see how I have 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.170
 said before it will not be possible to put it back 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.680
 same coach and that I already put 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.770
 at the beginning, however, I think we can't 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.770
 do 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.360
 you have already received this woman to you 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360
 succeed 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:04:03.830
 what are you waiting for? 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:07.410
 found 500 succeed written I found 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.060
 and moore and you do it up then you are 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:16.140
 you will receive amber of level 50 then of 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.640
 surfer york is 470 is the code 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.310
 pokemon 479 and that will always succeed the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.120
 same thing and it will be the same level as 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.800
 amber and also san rocco the same thing 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.870
