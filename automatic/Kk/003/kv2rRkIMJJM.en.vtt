00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
can you know it max outwits right now

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.720 
can you know it max outwits right now
you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.470> whether<00:02:06.620> it's<00:02:06.830> your<00:02:07.250> fibers<00:02:07.610> your

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
you know whether it's your fibers your

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.609 
you know whether it's your fibers your
tube<00:02:07.850> online<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.209> whatnot<00:02:08.450> but<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.200> reality

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
tube online and whatnot but the reality

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.069 
tube online and whatnot but the reality
is<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.399> moment<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.789> get<00:02:10.970> above<00:02:11.329> 5<00:02:11.689> megabits

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
is the moment you get above 5 megabits

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.170 
is the moment you get above 5 megabits
our<00:02:12.620> streaming<00:02:13.040> becomes<00:02:13.310> very<00:02:13.579> smooth<00:02:13.909> and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
our streaming becomes very smooth and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.430 
our streaming becomes very smooth and
you<00:02:14.329> look<00:02:14.480> at<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.629> resolution

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
you look at the resolution

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.780 
you look at the resolution
and<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:16.010> band<00:02:16.190> which<00:02:16.370> will<00:02:16.490> just<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and and the band which will just you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.280 
and and the band which will just you
know<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> package<00:02:17.330> will<00:02:17.450> come<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.720> nicely<00:02:17.930> so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
know the package will come in nicely so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.780 
know the package will come in nicely so
the<00:02:18.710> whole<00:02:18.830> point<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.130> just<00:02:19.310> make<00:02:19.460> sure<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the whole point is just make sure that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.130 
the whole point is just make sure that
you're<00:02:19.910> above<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.990> can

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
you're above that and so that you can

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.560 
you're above that and so that you can
get<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.530> basically<00:02:22.160> seamless<00:02:22.550> experience<00:02:22.640> now

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
get a basically seamless experience now

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.690 
get a basically seamless experience now
how<00:02:23.750> does<00:02:23.810> multiplayer<00:02:24.470> work<00:02:24.740> because<00:02:25.220> my

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
how does multiplayer work because my

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340 
how does multiplayer work because my
thing<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.210> was<00:02:26.300> like<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.990> streaming

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
thing is I was like in a streaming

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.970 
thing is I was like in a streaming
service<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:28.220> must<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:29.090> even<00:02:29.300> harder<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:30.230> try<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
service it must be even harder to try to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.440 
service it must be even harder to try to
pull<00:02:31.190> off<00:02:31.310> multiplayer<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.090> lot<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.360> these

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
pull off multiplayer in a lot of these

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030 
pull off multiplayer in a lot of these
games<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:32.930> war<00:02:33.320> session<00:02:33.650> has

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
games like that war session has

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.250 
games like that war session has
multiplayer<00:02:34.400> like<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.330> possible<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
multiplayer like is it possible that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.960 
multiplayer like is it possible that
multiplayer<00:02:36.830> with<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.130> streaming<00:02:37.370> service<00:02:37.520> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
multiplayer with a streaming service and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.600 
multiplayer with a streaming service and
so<00:02:38.180> how<00:02:38.360> does<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.630> work<00:02:38.840> well<00:02:39.740> yes<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.460> does

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
so how does that work well yes it does

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.760 
so how does that work well yes it does
multiplier<00:02:41.480> does<00:02:41.690> work<00:02:41.930> oh<00:02:42.140> yeah<00:02:42.380> what's<00:02:42.590> my

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
multiplier does work oh yeah what's my

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.520 
multiplier does work oh yeah what's my

you're looking at extreme technology and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.740 
you're looking at extreme technology and
it's<00:02:58.280> about<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.580> inputs<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.270> outputs<00:02:59.720> that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
it's about the inputs and outputs that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
because to me I mean everybody always

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.740 
because to me I mean everybody always
say<00:03:34.459> where<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.090> get<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.270> whole<00:03:35.540> library

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
say where we get the whole library

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.140 
say where we get the whole library
that's<00:03:36.410> what<00:03:36.560> everybody<00:03:36.890> always<00:03:37.010> X<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.910> what

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
that's what everybody always X so what

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.120

does<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.420> take<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.959> game<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.920> run

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
does it take to get a game just to run

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.880
