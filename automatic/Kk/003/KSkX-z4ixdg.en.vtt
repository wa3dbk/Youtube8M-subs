great<00:01:08.980> in<00:01:09.700> terms<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.060> reusable<00:01:10.600> ones<00:01:10.750> I

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
great in terms of the reusable ones I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.660 
great in terms of the reusable ones I
really<00:01:11.200> like<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.500> idea<00:01:11.530> behind<00:01:11.950> them<00:01:12.220> but<00:01:12.460> I

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
really like the idea behind them but I

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.030 
really like the idea behind them but I
go<00:01:13.000> through<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> lot<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.720> these<00:01:13.870> and<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.320> just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
go through a lot of these and I just

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.950 
go through a lot of these and I just
don't<00:01:15.190> find<00:01:15.310> them<00:01:15.370> as<00:01:15.520> practical<00:01:16.060> because<00:01:16.360> you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
don't find them as practical because you

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.210 
don't find them as practical because you
have<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.140> wash<00:01:17.290> them<00:01:17.530> all<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.740> time<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.160> you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
have to wash them all the time and you

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.160 
have to wash them all the time and you
need<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> whole<00:01:18.790> lot<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.150> them<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.780> really

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
need a whole lot of them so I really

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.810 
need a whole lot of them so I really
