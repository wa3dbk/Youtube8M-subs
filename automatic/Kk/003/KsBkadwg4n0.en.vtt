giving you my first impressions of this

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.360 
giving you my first impressions of this
game<00:00:09.960> now<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.260> game<00:00:10.679> player<00:00:10.889> watching<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
game now the game player watching in the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.890 
game now the game player watching in the
background<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.880> actually<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> first<00:00:12.480> ever

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
background is actually the first ever

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.740 
background is actually the first ever
time<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.710> went<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.549> game<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.360> was<00:00:15.540> not

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
time I went on this game so I was not

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.620 
time I went on this game so I was not
very<00:00:15.870> good<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.240> bit<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> crazy

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
very good and it was a bit of a crazy

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.960 
very good and it was a bit of a crazy
time<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.590> no<00:00:19.920> idea<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.820> was<00:00:20.910> doing

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
time because I no idea what I was doing

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
time because I no idea what I was doing
and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.900> also<00:00:22.109> started<00:00:22.529> off<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.220> 6th<00:00:23.550> gear

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
and I also started off this in 6th gear

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300 
and I also started off this in 6th gear
and<00:00:24.029> didn't<00:00:24.660> realize<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.109> manual<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and didn't realize in manual and just

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.759 
and didn't realize in manual and just
went<00:00:26.490> flying<00:00:26.910> into<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.420> gravel<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.529> first

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
went flying into the gravel on my first

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.450 
went flying into the gravel on my first
corner<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.849> try<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> f1<00:00:30.840> 2013<00:00:31.460> but

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
corner on my first try of f1 2013 but

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
corner on my first try of f1 2013 but
you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.329> still<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.630> 6th<00:00:33.989> gear<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you can see here I'm still in 6th gear I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
you can see here I'm still in 6th gear I
haven't<00:00:34.530> realized<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.190> yet<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.210> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
haven't realized it yet but I'm gonna be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.959 
haven't realized it yet but I'm gonna be
trundling<00:00:37.020> around<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.469> 6th<00:00:37.890> gear<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.760> another

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
trundling around in 6th gear for another

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
trundling around in 6th gear for another
couple<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.510> corners<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.320> gonna<00:00:40.440> finally

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
couple of corners then I'm gonna finally

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
couple of corners then I'm gonna finally
realize<00:00:41.219> oh<00:00:41.430> yeah<00:00:42.149> Tim<00:00:42.450> annual<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.350> been

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
realize oh yeah Tim annual have been

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
realize oh yeah Tim annual have been
anyway<00:00:43.800> let's<00:00:44.460> talk<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
anyway let's talk about some of the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
anyway let's talk about some of the
things<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:46.020> I've<00:00:46.200> noticed<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.550> all

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
things that I've noticed first of all

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
things that I've noticed first of all
with<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.090> first<00:00:48.300> impressions<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> game

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with my first impressions of this game

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
with my first impressions of this game
and<00:00:49.789> first<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> overall<00:00:51.660> physics<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and first off the overall physics of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
and first off the overall physics of
this<00:00:52.320> game<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.879> good<00:00:54.030> they

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this game are really really good they

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.010 
this game are really really good they
improved<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.670> 2012's<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.210> 2012<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
improved on 2012's and I think 2012 a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
improved on 2012's and I think 2012 a
big<00:00:58.199> step<00:00:58.440> forward<00:00:58.710> personally<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> wasn't<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
big step forward personally I wasn't a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900 
big step forward personally I wasn't a
big<00:01:00.059> fan<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> 2011<00:01:01.379> physics<00:01:02.100> /<00:01:02.309> 2012

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
big fan of the 2011 physics / 2012

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
big fan of the 2011 physics / 2012
physics<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.570> were<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> now

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
physics I think were really good and now

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
physics I think were really good and now
2013<00:01:05.519> physics<00:01:06.210> including<00:01:06.450> classic<00:01:07.170> cars<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
2013 physics including classic cars and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.070 
2013 physics including classic cars and
obviously<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> modern<00:01:08.490> cars<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.210> pretty

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
obviously the modern cars are pretty

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
obviously the modern cars are pretty
much<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.380> improvement<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.130> 2012<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.150> we're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
much an improvement on 2012 so we're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
much an improvement on 2012 so we're
pretty<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.320> getting<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> rounded

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
pretty much getting that the rounded

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.830 
pretty much getting that the rounded
package<00:01:14.939> we're<00:01:15.150> getting<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> round<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
package we're getting the round a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
package we're getting the round a
package<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.409> four<00:01:16.920> years<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.369> hard<00:01:17.580> work<00:01:17.670> from

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
package of four years of hard work from

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
package of four years of hard work from
codemasters<00:01:18.810> obviously<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.590> des<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.159> fourth

official game of you exclude f1 2009 and

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
official game of you exclude f1 2009 and
this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> big<00:01:25.439> time<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.100> going

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
this is the big time that they're going

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
this is the big time that they're going
to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.340> showing<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.509> do

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to be showing this is what we can do

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749 
to be showing this is what we can do
we've<00:01:28.140> had<00:01:28.320> four<00:01:28.590> years<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
we've had four years on this and this is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
we've had four years on this and this is
the<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.570> wanted<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> create<00:01:31.140> all

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the game that we wanted to create all

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
the game that we wanted to create all
along<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.189> personally<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
along and I personally think this is the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
along and I personally think this is the
best<00:01:34.350> game<00:01:34.619> certified<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.820> by<00:01:36.030> far<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
best game certified I think by far is

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
best game certified I think by far is
the<00:01:36.509> best<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.110> far<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> addition

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the best game so far with the addition

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
the best game so far with the addition
of<00:01:38.280> classic<00:01:38.820> cars<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.900> sort<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of classic cars and all that sort of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
of classic cars and all that sort of
stuff<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.770> overruled<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.670> physics<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
stuff and overruled the physics and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.910 
stuff and overruled the physics and
everything<00:01:42.840> feeling<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.350> nice<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.829> makes

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
everything feeling a lot nice it makes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.230 
everything feeling a lot nice it makes

find something like a little glitch on
the<00:02:11.430> first<00:02:11.670> couple<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.940> days<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.569> sure<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the first couple of days be sure to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
the first couple of days be sure to
report<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.440> to

report it to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.630 
report it to
because<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.219> the<00:02:14.280> sort<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.549> things

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
because these are the sort of things

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640 
because these are the sort of things
they<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.390> want<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.900> improve<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
they really want to improve and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.839 
they really want to improve and
obviously<00:02:17.129> they've<00:02:17.310> read<00:02:17.519> all<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> articles

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
obviously they've read all the articles

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.929 
obviously they've read all the articles
and<00:02:18.359> everything<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.459> personally

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
and everything and I don't personally

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.030 
and everything and I don't personally
know<00:02:21.000> why<00:02:21.299> was<00:02:21.480> using<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.140> chase<00:02:22.409> camera<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
know why was using the chase camera I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
know why was using the chase camera I
think<00:02:23.430> I'd<00:02:23.549> found<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:24.000> lot<00:02:24.180> easier<00:02:24.450> whilst

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
think I'd found out a lot easier whilst

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.569 
think I'd found out a lot easier whilst
using<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.319> manual<00:02:25.530> gears<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.069> used<00:02:26.219> to<00:02:26.340> chase

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
using the manual gears to used to chase

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.270 
using the manual gears to used to chase
camera<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.659> quite<00:02:28.170> nice<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.739> see<00:02:29.159> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
camera but it's quite nice to see this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.580 
camera but it's quite nice to see this
all<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.700> model<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> classic<00:02:31.349> car<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
all the model of the the classic car I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.110 
all the model of the the classic car I
think<00:02:31.889> that's<00:02:32.310> something<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.670> they've

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
think that's something that they've

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.970 
think that's something that they've
improved<00:02:33.450> quite<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> lot<00:02:34.079> as<00:02:34.200> well<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.530> models

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
improved quite a lot as well be models

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
improved quite a lot as well be models
of<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.219> the<00:02:36.120> classic<00:02:36.510> cars<00:02:36.719> and<00:02:37.019> obviously

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
of the the classic cars and obviously

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.690 
of the the classic cars and obviously
the<00:02:37.379> modern<00:02:37.500> cars<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:38.040> been<00:02:38.189> vastly

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the modern cars have been vastly

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.459 
the modern cars have been vastly
improved<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.810> you're<00:02:39.930> going<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.139> really<00:02:40.260> like

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
improved so you're going to really like

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.640 
improved so you're going to really like
them<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.950> also<00:02:41.340> sort<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.450> realism<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
them and also sort of that realism is a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
them and also sort of that realism is a
you<00:02:44.340> know<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> little<00:02:44.670> bit<00:02:44.819> more<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.299> there<00:02:45.510> now

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you know a little bit more up there now

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
you know a little bit more up there now
because<00:02:46.079> obviously<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.889> you<00:02:47.010> come<00:02:47.159> at<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
because obviously when you come at the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.580 
because obviously when you come at the
corner<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.939> i<00:02:48.599> think<00:02:48.900> i<00:02:48.989> was<00:02:49.079> on<00:02:49.169> medium

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
corner and i think i was on medium

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
corner and i think i was on medium
traction<00:02:49.950> control<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.540> come<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
traction control but you come out the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.379 
traction control but you come out the
corner<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> car<00:02:52.560> sliding<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> little

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
corner the car sliding just put a little

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.149 
corner the car sliding just put a little
bit<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.870> throttle<00:02:55.139> down<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.829> get<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
bit of throttle down and you get the

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.119 
bit of throttle down and you get the
back<00:02:56.310> end<00:02:56.579> get<00:02:56.760> sideways<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.950> yeah<00:02:58.950> that's

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
back end get sideways and yeah that's

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.699 
back end get sideways and yeah that's
obviously<00:02:59.459> very<00:02:59.730> iconic<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.719> the<00:03:00.810> cars<00:03:01.019> back

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
obviously very iconic of the cars back

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.550 
obviously very iconic of the cars back
then<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.150> actually<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.659> 92

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
then and this is actually the 92

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.319 
then and this is actually the 92
williams<00:03:05.069> i<00:03:05.219> think<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.879> correct<00:03:06.180> me<00:03:06.269> if

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
williams i think you can correct me if

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.750 
williams i think you can correct me if
i'm<00:03:06.419> wrong<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:06.659> i<00:03:06.980> think<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.219> 92

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
i'm wrong but i think this is the 92

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.979 
i'm wrong but i think this is the 92

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
of the iconic cars in the game not just

corner and if you've noticed guys
because<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.829> took<00:04:02.009> me<00:04:02.069> quite<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.340> long<00:04:02.549> time

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
because this took me quite a long time

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.879 
because this took me quite a long time
to<00:04:02.909> realize<00:04:03.090> myself<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.530> has<00:04:04.680> got<00:04:04.859> a

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
to realize myself is that this has got a

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.460 
to realize myself is that this has got a
different<00:04:05.040> HUD<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.479> 80s<00:04:06.840> cars<00:04:07.139> and

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
different HUD to the the 80s cars and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.920 
different HUD to the the 80s cars and
also<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.669> modern<00:04:09.000> cars<00:04:09.269> this<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.659> good<00:04:09.840> i've

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
also the modern cars this is good i've

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.879 
also the modern cars this is good i've
got<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.349> black<00:04:11.069> box<00:04:11.489> or<00:04:11.989> harder<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.169> I<00:04:13.590> think

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
got the black box or harder and I think

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.939 
got the black box or harder and I think
that's<00:04:14.159> all<00:04:14.340> resembles<00:04:15.180> what<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> TV<00:04:16.349> sort<00:04:16.889> of

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
that's all resembles what the TV sort of

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.890 
that's all resembles what the TV sort of
style<00:04:17.099> was<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.579> back<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.329> sort<00:04:18.599> of<00:04:18.659> time

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
style was like back in that sort of time

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.990 
style was like back in that sort of time
in<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.109> era<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> 80s<00:04:20.639> you've<00:04:20.849> got

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
in that era and with the 80s you've got

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
in that era and with the 80s you've got
quite<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.209> lot<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.509> CP<00:04:21.959> ER<00:04:22.019> on<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.320> screen<00:04:22.620> and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
quite a lot of CP ER on the screen and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.209 
quite a lot of CP ER on the screen and
that's<00:04:23.219> a<00:04:23.310> big<00:04:23.580> thing<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:24.120> didn't<00:04:24.510> notice<00:04:24.990> until

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.219 
that's a big thing I didn't notice until

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.580 
that's a big thing I didn't notice until
he<00:04:26.219> pointed<00:04:26.789> it<00:04:26.909> out

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
he pointed it out

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.280 
he pointed it out
and<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.910> know<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.419> don't<00:04:29.600> really<00:04:29.780> pick<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.139> on

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
and you know you don't really pick up on

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.510 
and you know you don't really pick up on
those<00:04:30.410> things<00:04:30.650> unless<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.010> play<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.340> game<00:04:31.460> a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
those things unless you play the game a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.030 
those things unless you play the game a
lot<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:31.940> now<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:32.990> was<00:04:33.139> really<00:04:33.440> cool<00:04:33.590> i<00:04:33.650> think

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
lot and now that was really cool i think

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.010 
lot and now that was really cool i think
that<00:04:34.190> they<00:04:34.310> spent<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.639> lot<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.850> time<00:04:34.970> making<00:04:35.720> it

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
that they spent a lot of time making it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.990 
that they spent a lot of time making it
feel<00:04:36.169> like<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.500> are<00:04:36.710> racing<00:04:37.190> in<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.460> era<00:04:37.699> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
feel like you are racing in that era and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.240 
feel like you are racing in that era and

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
you might not realize them like the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.159 
you might not realize them like the
until<00:05:05.120> you've<00:05:05.240> played<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.570> game<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:05.900> quite<00:05:06.139> a

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
until you've played the game for quite a

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.580 
until you've played the game for quite a
bit<00:05:06.470> but<00:05:07.100> one<00:05:07.550> last<00:05:07.729> thing<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.750> sound<00:05:09.260> is

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
bit but one last thing the the sound is

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.100 
bit but one last thing the the sound is
vastly<00:05:10.160> improved<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:10.760> think<00:05:11.030> especially<00:05:11.450> on

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
vastly improved I think especially on

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.960 
vastly improved I think especially on
the<00:05:12.470> classic<00:05:12.770> cause<00:05:13.130> they're<00:05:13.370> classic<00:05:13.760> cars

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
the classic cause they're classic cars

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.420 
the classic cause they're classic cars
have<00:05:14.180> awesome<00:05:14.660> sound<00:05:14.960> sadly<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.800> can't<00:05:16.160> give

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
you any sound of these because it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.240
