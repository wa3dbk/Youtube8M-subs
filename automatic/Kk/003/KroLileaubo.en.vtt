00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.060
 hello everyone and welcome you to the videos of 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.660
 photo art 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.670
 yes you saw or smile at 32 teeth 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.820
 today there is a ninety piece up front here 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.460
 it is a silvestri camera in 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.890
 especially the t 30 this is one 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 very special machine a car 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.690
 if we are thinking about the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.270
 pure professionalism because it has 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.300
 technical features and a cost that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.129
 it is not approachable by everyone but yes 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.370
 does it to repay to the last penny 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.250
 for its constructive qualities of benches 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.420
 optical folding not folding machines by 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.409
 quality of maybe more or less 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.050
 I have had advanced features 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.420
 so many of my life now finally one 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.269
 with whom I worked for almost everything 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.309
 the course of the slabs over the years I speak 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.110
 of commercial photography 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.630
 it was this yes best because 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.670
 first of all it is very compact and very e 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.990
 very manageable even from the point of 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.420
 view of operations 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.630
 not that you shoot freehand but 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.509
 be careful with a back 6 for 12 is a lot 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.560
 beautiful to use even freehand 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.509
 They are those things that we say inspire 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.850
 which maybe you launch in some 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.310
 street project done in panoramic 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 this machine has features 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.990
 I'm going to present them now why 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.210
 even on the net there is not much to 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 arrangement and worth knowing about it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.829
 a little in all its parts 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.710
 the comeback on the stand for simplicity 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.950
 then first let's say made one 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 machine that is composed of a body 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.229
 mobile that serves to decentralize the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.450
 decentralization occurs by moving like 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.869
 see this ring then doing 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.939
 go up the lens of course already 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.229
 otherwise the lens can decentralize 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.700
 downward 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.789
 in this regard, I invite you to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 consider in the case of a purchase of 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.410
 choose this device that you 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.840
 call week reverse this way 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.240
 see putting it on the easel enough 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.330
 he takes 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.180
 in the car turn it like this if you don't have it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.860
 this becomes much more problematic 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480
 because you will have to move the plate 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.010
 reassemble it, etc. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.710
 instead in this way it really is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.930
 issue of a second to make the release 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.850
 and the hang-up in the world where you want 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.040
 precisely to report this 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 condition 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.750
 another characteristic element is the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.750
 assembly of coid lines and this one in 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.300
 particular a lens and a 47 mm 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.950
 super corner of the schneider an xl from 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.020
 120 degrees 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.940
 one of the most beautiful lenses in the home 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.790
 schneider undoubtedly one of the most 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.560
 also used because it goes very well 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 with digital backs therefore he has 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.590
 continued its existence also 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.500
 in the digital age diaphragms 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.770
 shutter shutter speeds are perfect 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.140
 because this machine is really like 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.760
 all the optical bench machines are 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.430
 have been employed little by any 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 professional as not only 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 we have a variety of tools with i 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.150
 which ones to work but not every day yes 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.890
 take pictures with flat films or with gods 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720
 digital backs 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.420
 another feature I told you and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.660
 this lever that unlocking allows us 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.690
 to turn the back 360 degrees 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.090
 this is an extremely useful function 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.190
 because it allows us to move from 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.010
 that vertical frame 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.710
 horizontal in a moment and above all 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.870
 to dial in to have a 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.400
 immediacy rather than turning 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.740
 disassemble and reassemble 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.540
 I have to tell the truth the practicality and the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.520
 speed of this machine beyond doubt 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.340
 is that it is very interesting 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.210
 obviously the back hooks to leave 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.940
 place at a digital back as well as yes 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.810
 also unlocks the lens 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.330
 I wanted to show you through this 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.130
 release button the lens I go to 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.900
 to close temporarily for 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.380
 show you what the body really is 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.209
 machine is only this piece with the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.799
 decentralization 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.520
 that's why sylvans 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.470
 has devised all the modularity of these 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.259
 machines therefore of the rings they serve 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 to space the plane of the film 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.690
 to increase the draft of the lenses 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.349
 therefore we can mount up to 100 120 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.039
 mm on these machines in particular here 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:44.129
 you can see a back 4 x 5 to 10 12 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.139
 It is of type bears man then the chassis is 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.060
 put it in here or even the back 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.889
 if they lose 17 sets you have a 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.020
 layout 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.569
 vice versa if it is not a backstroke 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.639
 field is disassembled by the glass 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.879
 frosted and goes to fit the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.699
 our back with these two levers that it 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.719
 they block cars like stupid 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.449
 still one thing to say 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.389
 certainly it is provided with bubbles for the 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.120
 machine leveling are 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.949
 grafted into the frame is one 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.560
 feature concerning this 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.020
 car in particular is what it is 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.370
 been developed directly together 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.770
 to the engineer silvestri 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.449
 I went to him for some time 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.050
 during 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.650
 two of the 2000s to see to have 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.069
 a car that could serve not 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.719
 only in the medium format where they are designed 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.979
 essentially these machines here but 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.490
 even on large format 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:49.719
 that's why this machine brings the 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.539
 serial number 000 because we have it 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.580
 developed taking into account needs that 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.699
 I had very particular therefore to have 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.830
 a full format also with a 47 mm e 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.900
 so there are shapes on the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.120
 frame so to the main one that 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.330
 secondary than just this machine 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.830
 therefore not only for the professional 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.180
 but also the passionate collector 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.789
 can do us a little thought because a 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.580
 really very particular object 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.649
 returning instead to its nature 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.620
 photographic this appliance in 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:25.509
 particular represents a composed kit 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.249
 from the frame 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.409
 here it is from the camera body 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:32.469
 with frosted glass that can house 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:36.159
 any type of back film holder 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:39.969
 type of bear hand means and a 47 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:42.099
 mm schneider xl super corner mounted 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.889
 on the rich and original schneider 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.520
 so with the perfect calibration because 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.469
 they are made right by the parent company 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.129
 the lens as I told you is in condition 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.969
 perfect 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.979
 this kit may interest many vi 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.199
 I invite you to read the technical specifications 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.240
 in the pages of the site 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.949
 thank you for having seen of fotoarte 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.419
 and gives him an appointment to the next 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.419
 hello video everyone
