good thing about the titanium rig is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.840 
good thing about the titanium rig is
that<00:00:45.410> whenever<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.769> give<00:00:46.039> your<00:00:46.160> rod<00:00:46.399> just<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
that whenever you give your rod just a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.119 
that whenever you give your rod just a
little<00:00:47.089> bit<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.359> pump<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.989> just<00:00:48.859> kind<00:00:49.070> of

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
little bit of a pump it just kind of

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.950 
little bit of a pump it just kind of
pulsates<00:00:49.699> out<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.269> then<00:00:50.359> you<00:00:50.480> can<00:00:50.660> pick

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
pulsates out there and then you can pick

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.229 
pulsates out there and then you can pick
back<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:51.199> on<00:00:51.559> your<00:00:51.589> retrieve<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.429> that's<00:00:52.969> just

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
back up on your retrieve so that's just

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.759 
back up on your retrieve so that's just
going<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.480> act<00:00:53.659> as<00:00:53.899> just<00:00:54.109> an<00:00:54.230> extra<00:00:54.620> little

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
going to act as just an extra little

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.040 
going to act as just an extra little
pulsation<00:00:55.640> out<00:00:55.820> there<00:00:56.059> especially<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
pulsation out there especially when the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.899 
pulsation out there especially when the
water<00:00:57.260> is<00:00:57.350> cold<00:00:57.589> like<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.159> or<00:00:58.460> whenever<00:00:58.640> you

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
squadron heads the design of the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.840 
squadron heads the design of the
squadron<00:01:36.890> head<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.310> have<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.460> little<00:01:37.700> bit

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
squadron head you have a little bit

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.359 
squadron head you have a little bit
bulkier<00:01:38.329> head<00:01:38.689> style<00:01:39.380> up<00:01:39.619> at<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.860> front<00:01:40.009> and

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
bulkier head style up at the front and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.310 
bulkier head style up at the front and
then<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.579> comes<00:01:40.759> back<00:01:40.909> down<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.719> all<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:41.990> your

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
then it comes back down so all of your

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.440 
then it comes back down so all of your
plastics<00:01:42.979> will<00:01:43.399> fall<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.909> line<00:01:44.119> right

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
plastics will fall in line right

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.179 
plastics will fall in line right
underneath<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:45.049> because<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.530> lead<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
underneath it because the lead of the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.859 
underneath it because the lead of the
squadron<00:01:46.490> head<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.000> kind<00:01:47.149> of<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.359> to<00:01:47.479> going

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
squadron head is kind of going to going

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.510 
squadron head is kind of going to going
to<00:01:47.930> kind<00:01:48.079> of<00:01:48.109> cover<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.619> up<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.009> make<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:49.219> look

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
this head design is going to go through

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.160 
this head design is going to go through
rock<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.910> ledge<00:02:37.090> rock<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.690> things<00:02:37.960> like<00:02:38.110> that

rock and ledge rock and things like that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.470 
rock and ledge rock and things like that
really<00:02:38.650> well<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.460> it's<00:02:39.580> also<00:02:39.820> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.240> serve

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
really well but it's also going to serve

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.900 
really well but it's also going to serve
as<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:41.170> good<00:02:41.410> hook<00:02:41.770> which<00:02:42.640> will<00:02:42.820> go

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
as a really good hook which will go

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.700 
as a really good hook which will go
through<00:02:43.150> cover<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.750> flip<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.230> hook<00:02:44.530> you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
through cover you can flip this hook you

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.280 
through cover you can flip this hook you
can<00:02:44.860> cast<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.880> fish<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.330> ledges<00:02:46.870> so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
can cast it you can fish it on ledges so

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.870 
can cast it you can fish it on ledges so
it's<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> really<00:02:47.980> versatile<00:02:48.610> jig

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
it's going to be a really versatile jig

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's going to be a really versatile jig
now<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:50.050> will<00:02:50.200> probably<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.740> only<00:02:50.920> jig<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
now this will probably the only jig that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.430 
now this will probably the only jig that
I<00:02:51.670> have<00:02:51.850> tied<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.300> my<00:02:52.450> rod<00:02:52.660> because<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.200> such

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
I have tied on my rod because it's such

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.620 
I have tied on my rod because it's such
a<00:02:53.470> well-rounded<00:02:54.070> jig<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:54.970> got<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.210> zero

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
a well-rounded jig it's got a zero

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330 
a well-rounded jig it's got a zero
degree<00:02:55.990> line<00:02:56.200> tie<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:56.920> which<00:02:57.070> comes

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
degree line tie on it which comes

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
degree line tie on it which comes
straight<00:02:57.700> out<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:59.080> got<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
straight out like that it's got the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.740 
straight out like that it's got the

perfect tension on the weed guard and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.620 
perfect tension on the weed guard and
put<00:03:01.960> a<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.320> good<00:03:02.590> owner<00:03:03.250> hook<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.360> there

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
put a really good owner hook on there
