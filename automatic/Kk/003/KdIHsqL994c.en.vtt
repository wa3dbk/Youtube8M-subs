00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
channel you you kind of start doing it

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.539 
channel you you kind of start doing it
for<00:03:57.980> different<00:03:58.190> reasons<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.389> it's<00:03:59.989> not<00:04:00.230> like

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
put copyrighted songs and videos so um I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.150 
put copyrighted songs and videos so um I
had<00:04:46.760> like<00:04:46.940> 15<00:04:47.450> copyrighted<00:04:48.050> videos<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.890> I'm

had like 15 copyrighted videos and I'm

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.590 
had like 15 copyrighted videos and I'm
surprised<00:04:49.520> I<00:04:49.640> haven't<00:04:49.730> gotten<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.120> strike<00:04:50.420> yet

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
surprised I haven't gotten a strike yet

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.410 
surprised I haven't gotten a strike yet
but<00:04:50.780> i<00:04:50.810> deleted<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.320> lot<00:04:51.890> of<00:04:52.040> them<00:04:52.250> in<00:04:53.060> fear<00:04:53.300> that

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
but i deleted a lot of them in fear that

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.480 
but i deleted a lot of them in fear that
i<00:04:53.480> might<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> copyright<00:04:54.230> strike<00:04:54.350> in<00:04:54.860> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
i might get a copyright strike in the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.010 
i might get a copyright strike in the
future<00:04:55.820> because<00:04:55.970> they<00:04:56.120> can<00:04:56.270> still<00:04:56.480> turn<00:04:56.690> into

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
future because they can still turn into

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.080 
future because they can still turn into
strikes<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.770> few<00:04:58.130> of<00:04:58.220> my<00:04:58.370> left<00:04:58.610> up<00:04:58.790> because<00:04:59.030> i

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
strikes a few of my left up because i

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.030 
strikes a few of my left up because i
just<00:04:59.120> didn't<00:04:59.900> have<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.230> me<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.560> delete<00:05:00.800> them

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
just didn't have it in me to delete them

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.210 
just didn't have it in me to delete them
because<00:05:01.400> i<00:05:02.150> really<00:05:02.930> liked<00:05:03.110> those<00:05:03.410> videos<00:05:03.800> but

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
because i really liked those videos but

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.310 
because i really liked those videos but
i<00:05:04.550> deleted<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:05.000> few<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.270> them<00:05:05.390> and<00:05:05.690> technically

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
i deleted a few of them and technically

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.040 
i deleted a few of them and technically
I<00:05:06.710> guess<00:05:06.920> it<00:05:07.490> says<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.120> this<00:05:08.210> is<00:05:08.360> my<00:05:08.510> 300th

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
I guess it says that this is my 300th

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.290 
I guess it says that this is my 300th
video<00:05:09.320> now<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> added<00:05:09.980> those<00:05:10.250> ones<00:05:10.520> back

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
video now that I added those ones back

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.760 
video now that I added those ones back
but<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.570> did<00:05:11.780> delete<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.110> few<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.590> those

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
but I did delete a few of those

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.220 
but I did delete a few of those
copyrighted<00:05:13.460> once<00:05:13.670> so<00:05:14.000> um<00:05:14.540> technically<00:05:15.020> it's

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
copyrighted once so um technically it's

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.170 
copyrighted once so um technically it's
not<00:05:15.320> 300th<00:05:16.130> it's<00:05:16.340> probably<00:05:16.790> like<00:05:16.940> three

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
not 300th it's probably like three

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.820 
not 300th it's probably like three
hundred<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.570> five<00:05:18.050> or<00:05:18.290> something<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.650> don't

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
hundred and five or something I don't

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.470 
hundred and five or something I don't
