good<00:00:00.179> morning<00:00:00.480> everyone<00:00:00.659> thank<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.530> for<00:00:01.800> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
good morning everyone thank you for the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.700 
good morning everyone thank you for the
presentation<00:00:02.570> we<00:00:03.570> know<00:00:03.780> that<00:00:03.810> cancer<00:00:04.410> stem

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
presentation we know that cancer stem

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.590 
presentation we know that cancer stem
cell<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.040> responsible<00:00:05.700> for<00:00:05.730> sustaining<00:00:06.420> two

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
cell are responsible for sustaining two

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.410 
cell are responsible for sustaining two
more<00:00:06.779> grow<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.200> model<00:00:07.529> system<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.610> then<00:00:09.000> we

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
more grow in model system and then we

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.089 
more grow in model system and then we
know<00:00:09.599> also<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.550> tumor<00:00:11.550> are<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:13.259> abnormal

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
know also that tumor are are abnormal

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.810 
know also that tumor are are abnormal
tissue<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.820> hierarchical

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
tissue so they they have a hierarchical

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420 
tissue so they they have a hierarchical
organization<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.289> effects<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.890> disorder

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
organization and the effects of disorder

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
organization and the effects of disorder
did<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.850> year<00:00:21.270> are<00:00:21.420> key<00:00:21.600> there<00:00:22.170> are<00:00:22.320> cancer

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
did this year are key there are cancer

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120 
did this year are key there are cancer
stem<00:00:23.850> cell<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.810> today<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
stem cell so today we know that the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.920 
stem cell so today we know that the
cancer<00:00:26.699> stem<00:00:26.760> cell<00:00:27.060> exist<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.779> different

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
cancer stem cell exist in different

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.669 
cancer stem cell exist in different
human<00:00:28.529> being<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.730> related<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> long<00:00:30.900> list<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
human being is related in a long list of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.540 
human being is related in a long list of
solid<00:00:32.430> humor<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.860> matter<00:00:35.100> logical

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
solid humor and and the matter logical

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.080 
solid humor and and the matter logical
dizzy<00:00:35.930> emmitt<00:00:36.930> illogical<00:00:37.410> disease<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.219> we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
dizzy emmitt illogical disease and we

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
dizzy emmitt illogical disease and we
know<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.719> sustain<00:00:39.899> seller<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.559> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
know that can sustain seller of an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040 
know that can sustain seller of an
increased<00:00:41.550> ability<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.239> repay<00:00:42.540> our<00:00:42.570> DNA

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
increased ability to repay our DNA

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
increased ability to repay our DNA
damage<00:00:43.500> when<00:00:43.680> probably<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.700> disease

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
damage when probably this is the disease

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
damage when probably this is the disease
responsible<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> eris<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
responsible for the eris is the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.840 
responsible for the eris is the
resistance<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.940> chemotherapy<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.850> radiation

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.200 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation
so<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.420> need<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> new<00:00:52.100> drugs<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.460> targeting

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so we need the new drugs to targeting

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.160 
so we need the new drugs to targeting
cancer<00:00:54.809> stem<00:00:55.230> cell<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:57.719> reach<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cancer stem cell and to to reach a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.470 
cancer stem cell and to to reach a
long-term<00:00:58.770> remission<00:01:00.320> probably<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> drug

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
long-term remission probably this drug

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.649 
long-term remission probably this drug
would<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> direct<00:01:04.589> effect<00:01:05.450> on<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
would not have a direct effect on the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
would not have a direct effect on the
sides<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> tumor<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.369> tumor<00:01:10.430> losing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
sides of the tumor but tumor losing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
sides of the tumor but tumor losing
consistent<00:01:12.000> seller<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.380> ability

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
consistent seller was also the ability

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.520 
consistent seller was also the ability
to<00:01:13.860> generate<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.909> New<00:01:15.090> Zealand<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to generate the New Zealand because we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.310 
to generate the New Zealand because we
know<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> activating<00:01:17.580> Kara's<00:01:18.140> mutation<00:01:19.140> are

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
know that activating Kara's mutation are

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.070 
know that activating Kara's mutation are
present<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:21.270> pancreatic<00:01:21.930> adenocarcinoma

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
present in all pancreatic adenocarcinoma

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
present in all pancreatic adenocarcinoma
would<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.400> interesting<00:01:24.060> trying<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
would be very interesting trying to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.429 
would be very interesting trying to
modulate<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.340> chaos<00:01:26.790> activity<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:28.080> which

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
modulate the chaos activity with which

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.899 
modulate the chaos activity with which
of<00:01:28.710> chaos<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.780> tumor<00:01:31.430> after<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> few

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
of chaos in in this tumor after a few

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.649 
of chaos in in this tumor after a few
weeks<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:34.140> tumor<00:01:34.560> undergo<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:36.530> an<00:01:37.530> amazing

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
weeks the tumor undergo a an amazing

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.859 
weeks the tumor undergo a an amazing
reduction<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.810> volume<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.970> total<00:01:41.970> regression

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
reduction in volume a total regression

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
reduction in volume a total regression
and<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.189> end<00:01:44.689> they<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.290> scars<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and at the end they are just scars and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.790 
and at the end they are just scars and
with<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.810> few<00:01:49.170> epithelial<00:01:49.799> cell<00:01:50.270> in

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
with with few epithelial cell in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.640 
with with few epithelial cell in
the<00:01:52.420> destroy<00:01:53.420> but<00:01:54.230> if<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.210> reactivate<00:01:56.650> Kara's

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
the destroy but if we reactivate Kara's

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.870 
the destroy but if we reactivate Kara's
in<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.130> tumor<00:01:58.610> even<00:01:59.270> in<00:02:00.250> months<00:02:01.250> after<00:02:01.730> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
in this tumor even in months after the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.600 
in this tumor even in months after the
regression<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:03.350> tumor<00:02:03.680> relapse<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.430> means

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
regression the tumor relapse so it means

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.210 
regression the tumor relapse so it means
that<00:02:05.020> inside<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:09.170> tumor<00:02:09.800> this

regressive humor there are active

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.900 
regressive humor there are active
tumorigenic<00:02:14.690> cell<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.800> try<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.190> study<00:02:16.610> this

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
tumorigenic cell so I try to study this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.280 
tumorigenic cell so I try to study this
model<00:02:17.480> from<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.920> stencil<00:02:19.670> point<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.210> view<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.780> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
model from a stencil point of view and I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.250 
model from a stencil point of view and I
try<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.900> see<00:02:23.900> if<00:02:24.790> seller<00:02:25.790> from<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.390> tumor<00:02:26.840> are

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
try to see if seller from this tumor are

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.500 
try to see if seller from this tumor are
able<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.860> form<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.610> sphere<00:02:28.910> sphere<00:02:29.150> as<00:02:29.480> a

able to form a sphere sphere as a
cancerous<00:02:30.020> tumor<00:02:30.490> spheres<00:02:31.490> are<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:33.370> well-known

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
cancerous tumor spheres are a well-known

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.780 
cancerous tumor spheres are a well-known
surrogate<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.470> cancer<00:02:36.890> stem<00:02:37.070> cell<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.520> I've

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
surrogate of cancer stem cell and I've

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.110 
surrogate of cancer stem cell and I've
done<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.890> simple<00:02:39.890> experiment<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.970> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.800

reactivate chaos and the possible

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.620 
reactivate chaos and the possible

a karate extinction but kay rasa seems

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.509 
a karate extinction but kay rasa seems
to<00:03:50.510> exert<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.200> different<00:03:51.739> function<00:03:52.010> in

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
to exert a different function in

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.640 
to exert a different function in
different<00:03:52.550> cell<00:03:53.330> inside<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.930> sphere<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.530> our

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
different cell inside the sphere so our

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.979 
different cell inside the sphere so our
