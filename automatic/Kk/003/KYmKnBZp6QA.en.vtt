interesting
what<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.480> it

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
what is it

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.540 
what is it
every<00:03:25.970> thought<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.180> time<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.780> don't<00:03:26.930> miss<00:03:27.290> you

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.440 

wouldn't<00:03:31.550> make<00:03:31.640> my<00:03:31.790> sense<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.330> number

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
wouldn't make my sense of that number

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:45.380 
wouldn't make my sense of that number
but<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.590> fruit<00:03:33.830> apart

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:59.200 

when<00:03:46.390> this<00:03:46.540> ralpherz

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.000 

so<00:04:00.210> that's<00:04:00.450> give<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.140> new<00:04:01.320> dimension<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
so that's give a new dimension to the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.430 
so that's give a new dimension to the
