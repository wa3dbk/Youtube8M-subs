00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
several differences between this and the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.279 
several differences between this and the
BFI<00:00:47.460> set<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> star<00:00:48.390> even<00:00:48.600> dwarfs<00:00:48.960> started

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
BFI set for a star even dwarfs started

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.630 
BFI set for a star even dwarfs started
small<00:00:49.469> land<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> silence<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> darkness

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
small land of silence and darkness

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
small land of silence and darkness
aren't<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.390> set<00:00:51.980> neither<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.280> bow

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
aren't on that set neither is bow

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
aren't on that set neither is bow
there's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.120> soldier<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.629> where<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there's a little soldier and where the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.119 
there's a little soldier and where the
green<00:00:55.050> ants<00:00:55.579> dream<00:00:56.660> or<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.770> think<00:00:58.770> less<00:00:58.949> there's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
green ants dream or I think less there's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.439

a<00:00:59.190> darkness<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> little<00:00:59.760> diesel<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> fly

a darkness and little diesel need to fly

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
a darkness and little diesel need to fly
as<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.230> best<00:01:01.469> feeling<00:01:01.770> anyway<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.370> are

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
as well my best feeling anyway there are

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
as well my best feeling anyway there are
substantial<00:01:02.879> differences<00:01:03.270> between<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> two

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
substantial differences between the two

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.160 
substantial differences between the two
sets<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sets so this is really it really is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.399 
sets so this is really it really is
absolutely<00:01:07.619> beautiful<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.049> very<00:01:10.049> it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
absolutely beautiful it's a a very it's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
absolutely beautiful it's a a very it's
compact<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.460> weighty<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.210> substantial

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
compact but it's weighty and substantial

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.130 
compact but it's weighty and substantial
so<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.799> quite<00:01:14.280> gonna<00:01:14.670> fit<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.689> terms

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so it's not quite gonna fit and in terms

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
so it's not quite gonna fit and in terms
of<00:01:16.350> height<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:16.860> fit<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
of height it will fit in with your

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
of height it will fit in with your
collection<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.119> stick<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
collection but it will stick out a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
collection but it will stick out a
little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.380> compared<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little bit more compared to see that the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.350 
little bit more compared to see that the
BFI<00:01:21.330> set<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:21.780> fits<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.170> perfectly<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.270> we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
BFI set which fits in perfectly so if we

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
BFI set which fits in perfectly so if we
have<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> look<00:01:24.659> inside<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.130> just

space like so many people do have a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.460 
space like so many people do have a
problem<00:02:21.820> with<00:02:22.000> us<00:02:22.290> assuming<00:02:23.290> the

problem with us assuming the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.570 
problem with us assuming the

fiend and that that's the boob it is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.330 
fiend and that that's the boob it is
compact<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.380> sort<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.770> good<00:03:17.920> for<00:03:18.100> space

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
compact but so sort of a good for space

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.740 
compact but so sort of a good for space
but<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.730> also<00:03:18.940> sticks<00:03:19.270> out<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> little<00:03:19.450> bit<00:03:19.720> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
but that also sticks out a little bit so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.210

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
as I said but I really really can't

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.280

stress<00:03:24.370> her<00:03:25.120> tried<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.540> fit<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.170> do<00:03:26.260> a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
stress her tried to fit we just do a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.650 
stress her tried to fit we just do a
quick<00:03:26.560> compare<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.160> contrast<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.090> BFI

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
quick compare and contrast to the BFI

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.010 
quick compare and contrast to the BFI
sir<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.790> here<00:03:31.060> we<00:03:31.180> are<00:03:31.209> we<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.600> see<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
sir so here we are we can see the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.650 
sir so here we are we can see the
difference<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.500> size<00:03:32.709> right<00:03:33.280> there

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
difference in size right there

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.840 
difference in size right there
obviously<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.930> BFI<00:03:35.380> set<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.890> your<00:03:36.370> standard

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
obviously the BFI set is your standard

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.120 
obviously the BFI set is your standard
kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.600> blurry<00:03:37.870> height<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:41.620> all<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.040> way

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
kind of blurry height and it all the way

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.130 
kind of blurry height and it all the way
is<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.520> thicker<00:03:42.700> obviously<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.989> will

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
is a little thicker obviously it will

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.780 
is a little thicker obviously it will
fit<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.590> perfectly<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.010> your<00:03:45.250> collection

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
fit in perfectly with your collection

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.210
