00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
was having a new desk made and as part

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
was having a new desk made and as part
of<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.080> three<00:00:31.349> monitors<00:00:31.679> along<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> top

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
of that the three monitors along the top

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.760 
of that the three monitors along the top
of<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.969> six<00:00:33.239> displays<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> actually

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
of my six displays I'm going to actually

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
of my six displays I'm going to actually
change<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.640> three<00:00:35.880> new<00:00:36.120> monitors<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> didn't

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
change for three new monitors I didn't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
change for three new monitors I didn't
want<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.710> three<00:00:38.070> cinema<00:00:38.489> displays

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
want to get three cinema displays

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
want to get three cinema displays
because<00:00:39.149> ie<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> resolution<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.980> too

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because ie the resolution is a bit too

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.220 
because ie the resolution is a bit too
much<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:42.059> three<00:00:42.300> monitors<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.899> text

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
much for the top three monitors the text

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.600 
much for the top three monitors the text
gets<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.800> small<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.340> really

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
gets a little bit small you don't really

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
gets a little bit small you don't really
utilize<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.329> plus<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.930> don't<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
utilize it plus I don't really need it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
utilize it plus I don't really need it
for<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> top<00:00:47.100> three<00:00:47.370> monitors<00:00:47.789> because

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
for the top three monitors because

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
for the top three monitors because
that's<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.480> only<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that's really only for kind of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
that's really only for kind of
monitoring<00:00:49.980> things<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.780> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
display this is only a 1080p display but

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
display this is only a 1080p display but
as<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> reflections

as you can see from all the reflections

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
as you can see from all the reflections
this<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.380> literally<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.189> edge<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.850> edge<00:01:18.030> glass

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this is literally a edge to edge glass

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200 
this is literally a edge to edge glass
display<00:01:19.140> full<00:01:19.740> gloss<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> therefore<00:01:20.970> look

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
display full gloss and therefore look

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
display full gloss and therefore look
pretty<00:01:21.630> much<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> same<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.490> Apple<00:01:23.970> Cinema

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
pretty much the same as the Apple Cinema

pretty much the same as the Apple Cinema
displays

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
displays

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570

so<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.500> I've<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.890> six<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> them

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so when I've got all six of them

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
so when I've got all six of them
together<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.720> measured

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
together and I have actually measured

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
together and I have actually measured
the<00:01:28.220> dimensions<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.610> should<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.270> complete

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the dimensions it should be a complete

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.760 
the dimensions it should be a complete
sheet<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.470> glass<00:01:32.369> looking<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.619> very

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
sheet of glass looking so very very

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.170 
sheet of glass looking so very very

itself I wish that the actual power was
built<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> display<00:02:24.120> rather<00:02:24.450> than<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
built into the display rather than it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
built into the display rather than it
being<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.080> separate<00:02:25.410> unit<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.040> that's<00:02:26.640> how

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
being a separate unit but that's how

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.170 
being a separate unit but that's how
this<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.180> comes<00:02:27.500> now<00:02:28.500> next<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.550> also<00:02:29.790> get

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
see it's about a fingers width in terms

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.450 
see it's about a fingers width in terms
of<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.540> depth<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.960> the<00:03:49.080> monitor<00:03:49.470> around<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
of the depth of the monitor around the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.340 
of the depth of the monitor around the
back<00:03:50.670> we've<00:03:50.880> got<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.210> little<00:03:51.510> angle<00:03:51.960> here<00:03:52.230> that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
back we've got a little angle here that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.510 
back we've got a little angle here that
we<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.590> actually<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:53.040> swivel<00:03:53.280> with<00:03:53.460> a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
we can actually just swivel with a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.850 
we can actually just swivel with a
monitor<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.840> very<00:03:55.110> much<00:03:55.290> movement<00:03:55.590> in

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
monitor on not very much movement in

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.070 
monitor on not very much movement in
there<00:03:56.010> at<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.610> in<00:03:57.090> fact<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> stands

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
there at all and in fact in the stands

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
there at all and in fact in the stands
there's<00:03:58.260> absolutely<00:03:58.950> zero<00:03:59.340> height

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
there's absolutely zero height

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.930 
there's absolutely zero height
adjustment<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.200> these<00:04:01.350> are<00:04:01.500> dead<00:04:01.710> fixed<00:04:02.280> part

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
adjustment so these are dead fixed part

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.630 
adjustment so these are dead fixed part
from<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.600> actual<00:04:03.930> tilt<00:04:04.230> angle<00:04:04.620> itself<00:04:05.010> you

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
from the actual tilt angle itself you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.310 
from the actual tilt angle itself you
can't<00:04:05.880> go<00:04:05.970> up<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.270> down<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.810> also<00:04:06.930> can't
