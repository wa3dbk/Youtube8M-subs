first shield that I did like this and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
first shield that I did like this and
then<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> made<00:00:56.460> many<00:00:56.699> variations<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.539> show<00:00:57.750> how

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
then I made many variations to show how

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.130 
then I made many variations to show how
it<00:00:58.050> could<00:00:58.199> react<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> effects<00:00:59.870> we<00:01:00.870> grabbed

it could react to effects we grabbed

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.709 
it could react to effects we grabbed
many<00:01:01.379> feature<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.039> after<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.300> create

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
many feature and after that we create

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
many feature and after that we create

biggest challenges was to create an open

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.590 
biggest challenges was to create an open
world<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.490> we<00:05:35.640> can<00:05:35.790> see<00:05:36.030> in<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.270> Navajo

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.750 
world that we can see in the Navajo
sequence<00:05:37.140> the<00:05:37.590> scenery<00:05:37.950> represents<00:05:38.580> about

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
sequence the scenery represents about

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.090 
sequence the scenery represents about
two<00:05:39.030> square<00:05:39.300> kilometers<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:40.560> been<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.770> joint

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
two square kilometers it's been a joint

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.040 
two square kilometers it's been a joint
effort<00:05:41.220> between<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:42.000> vision<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.330> David<00:05:42.750> the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
effort between the vision of David the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.780 
effort between the vision of David the
technical<00:05:43.530> restrictions<00:05:43.680> and<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.460> artistic

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
technical restrictions and the artistic

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.630 
technical restrictions and the artistic
vision<00:05:45.650> another<00:05:46.650> challenge<00:05:47.100> was<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.340> build<00:05:47.370> a

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
vision another challenge was to build a

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.280 
vision another challenge was to build a
section<00:05:48.060> of<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.210> city<00:05:48.480> we<00:05:48.900> did<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.080> lot<00:05:49.260> of

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
section of a city we did a lot of

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.020 
section of a city we did a lot of
research<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:49.890> homeless<00:05:50.250> people<00:05:50.550> lived<00:05:50.760> in<00:05:50.910> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
research on homeless people lived in the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.120 
research on homeless people lived in the
United<00:05:51.420> States<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.320> we<00:05:52.440> work<00:05:52.590> together<00:05:52.770> to

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
United States and so we work together to

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.800 
United States and so we work together to
characterize<00:05:53.640> each<00:05:53.880> nook<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:54.330> cranny<00:05:54.570> I

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
characterize each nook and cranny I

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.020 
characterize each nook and cranny I
guess<00:05:55.530> we<00:05:55.680> pushed<00:05:55.950> on<00:05:56.100> both<00:05:56.310> our<00:05:56.460> engine<00:05:56.880> and

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
guess we pushed on both our engine and

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.890 
guess we pushed on both our engine and
the<00:05:57.300> capabilities<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:58.140> ps3<00:05:59.240> we<00:06:00.240> also<00:06:00.480> make

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
the capabilities of the ps3 we also make

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.260 
the capabilities of the ps3 we also make
the<00:06:01.080> sequence<00:06:01.500> changing<00:06:02.310> according<00:06:02.940> to<00:06:02.970> the

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
about our connection with an entity it

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.350 
about our connection with an entity it
was<00:07:01.409> a<00:07:01.439> real<00:07:01.740> challenge<00:07:01.770> for<00:07:02.310> us<00:07:02.490> when<00:07:03.060> we<00:07:03.180> go

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
was a real challenge for us when we go

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.510 
was a real challenge for us when we go
through<00:07:03.629> an<00:07:03.750> object<00:07:04.169> we<00:07:04.439> have<00:07:04.590> to<00:07:04.800> foresee<00:07:05.370> the

interior<00:07:06.000> of<00:07:06.180> this<00:07:06.719> object<00:07:08.539> so<00:07:09.539> we<00:07:09.719> had<00:07:09.840> a<00:07:09.870> lot

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
interior of this object so we had a lot

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.499 
interior of this object so we had a lot
of<00:07:10.379> detail<00:07:10.770> to<00:07:11.129> let<00:07:11.490> the<00:07:11.669> game<00:07:11.939> out<00:07:12.120> having<00:07:12.479> fun

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
of detail to let the game out having fun

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.629 
of detail to let the game out having fun
and<00:07:13.050> to<00:07:13.259> make<00:07:13.379> the<00:07:13.560> world<00:07:13.770> around<00:07:13.949> Georgie<00:07:14.520> and

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 
and to make the world around Georgie and

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:19.790 
and to make the world around Georgie and
Aiden<00:07:15.090> more<00:07:15.680> consistent<00:07:18.319> young<00:07:19.319> and<00:07:19.500> beyond

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
Aiden more consistent young and beyond

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.830 
Aiden more consistent young and beyond
there<00:07:20.250> is<00:07:20.280> an<00:07:20.430> important<00:07:20.909> fantasy<00:07:21.360> element<00:07:21.750> as

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
there is an important fantasy element as

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.839 
there is an important fantasy element as
well<00:07:22.020> that<00:07:22.349> includes<00:07:22.469> creatures<00:07:23.189> entities

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:23.849 
well that includes creatures entities

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:26.510 
well that includes creatures entities
etc<00:07:24.539> in<00:07:25.349> the<00:07:25.530> beginning<00:07:25.830> we<00:07:26.189> thought<00:07:26.219> about

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
etc in the beginning we thought about

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.769 
etc in the beginning we thought about
something<00:07:26.879> quite<00:07:27.180> Marines

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:27.779 
something quite Marines

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.600 
something quite Marines
but<00:07:28.259> with<00:07:28.379> an<00:07:28.469> aquatic<00:07:28.770> creature<00:07:29.159> it<00:07:29.490> was

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
but with an aquatic creature it was

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.700 
but with an aquatic creature it was
almost<00:07:29.759> too<00:07:30.150> real<00:07:30.180> so<00:07:31.080> we<00:07:31.110> changed<00:07:31.560> our<00:07:31.680> idea

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
almost too real so we changed our idea

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.529 
almost too real so we changed our idea
towards<00:07:32.250> something<00:07:32.490> more<00:07:32.610> polluting<00:07:33.210> more

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
towards something more polluting more

towards something more polluting more
