00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
survival knife type of a name I mean

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
survival knife type of a name I mean
yeah<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.480> could<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> could<00:00:39.930> serve<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
yeah it could it could serve as a as a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
yeah it could it could serve as a as a
hunting<00:00:41.250> knife<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.700> skinning<00:00:42.320> certainly<00:00:43.320> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
hunting knife or skinning certainly it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.130 
hunting knife or skinning certainly it
could<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.140> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
could do that but I think that this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 
could do that but I think that this
knife<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.620> been<00:00:46.829> designed<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.399> with

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
knife has been designed with with

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.040 
knife has been designed with with
general<00:00:48.480> duty<00:00:48.930> utility<00:00:49.590> duty<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> mind<00:00:51.050> comes

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
general duty utility duty in mind comes

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.639 
general duty utility duty in mind comes
with<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.770> tell<00:00:53.010> sheath<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> zai<00:00:55.410> tell

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
with as I tell sheath and the zai tell

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
with as I tell sheath and the zai tell
sheath<00:00:55.949> does<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:58.520> pitch<00:00:59.520> point<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sheath does have a pitch point on it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
sheath does have a pitch point on it
here<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> knife<00:01:01.980> clicks<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.840> when

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
here so it's so the knife clicks in when

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.310 
here so it's so the knife clicks in when
you<00:01:03.960> push<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.769> past<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> point<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you push that past that point and then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
you push that past that point and then
and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> stays<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.939> holds<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.360> securely

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and then it stays it holds it securely

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
and then it stays it holds it securely
that<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.860> does<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.280> four

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that way it does have it does have four

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.359 
that way it does have it does have four
holes<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.450> along<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> side<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.770> bottom<00:01:17.189> two

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
holes here along the side the bottom two

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
holes here along the side the bottom two
can<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> used<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> lake

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
there and that can be removed with just

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
there and that can be removed with just
these<00:01:33.420> screws<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.079> you'd<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.070> can

these screws if you'd like or you can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.749 
these screws if you'd like or you can
see<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.130> reversed<00:01:38.689> so

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
see that it can be it can be reversed so

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.160 
see that it can be it can be reversed so
you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> take<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could be when I say reverse what I mean

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.600 
could be when I say reverse what I mean
is<00:01:45.869> switch<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.680> upside<00:01:47.460> down<00:01:47.490> carry

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610
