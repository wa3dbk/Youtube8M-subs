00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 I started to see an ad in the tide 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 it's a magazine to which I have subscribed for quite a few years 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.220
 and for the age always starts with classifieds 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.609
 in the last page 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.429
 and then I came across an announcement at least big beginning of May 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 the bones consists of the house the enemy 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.060
 the couple just make phone calls 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.680
 contact 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.080
 I made contact and 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.720
 that's the result today 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 there I find myself john shipowners to the sailors 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.180
 he is the one who is the owner of the boat and it is he who is responsible for 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.430
 the clau we have been sailing since childhood 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.690
 the family 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.940
 of the day we started on your nothing 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.630
 at the bottom fifteen years now 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 and from one thing to another we have come to the cruise 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.550
 to rent boats and then now a grave in there completely 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.270
 this is the story of the boss of the building site 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.340
 you have protector untenable guardian 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340
 the actor though in this story 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 agree 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.590
 twenty-two meters overall 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.110
 with the bowsprit which is about seven meters long 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.390
 the draft is 2 meters 50 is why we are obliged 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020
 to wait for a big tide like today to get out of here 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 because mahmoud abbas put a little water he is 10 meters of pulling 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.210
 air 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.380
 that is, mary shelley's album at 10 cm long 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 the globe boston 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.619
 all volunteers 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.619
 with children 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 at least 500 dead 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.299

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.499
