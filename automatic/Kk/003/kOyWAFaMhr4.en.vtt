00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.360
 at home and it's very easy 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.900
 quietly everyone I do 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.600
 see a little what you need 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.000
 you will need a plastic glove from 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.160
 single-use scotch tape 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.130
 I had that card at home but that's okay 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.980
 any kind of scotch a post by 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.420
 old newspaper card 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.820
 take a little bit for example in 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.780
 many but still keeping in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.070
 quantity and finally paper aluminum 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.140
 obviously to have the measures of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.830
 reference we will need the dish in the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.950
 which are we going to make ours 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.930
 then appetizer with the zombie hand 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.490
 you will also need the dish in which 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.229
 you will want to make the recipe 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.730
 so if you want to have a little bit 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.220
 an idea of ​​the recipe 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.290
 I recommend going to see the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.580
 same power get an idea and see if 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.640
 it may interest you 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.950
 so now let's go to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.500
 make our madrid the first 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.479
 passage will fill our hand 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.520
 with newspaper sheets 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.140
 obviously we have to do it with policy 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.540
 in such a way as to make ours 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.570
 marina has just the feeling of 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.000
 be a hand to do it I recommend 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.180
 to start from life to do every 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.260
 finger take the size of the finger itself 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.040
 and go and cut a sheet of 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.000
 newspaper 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.610
 I do not know if precisely that it has precisely 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 the thickness of the book go as ad 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.090
 roll it up a little on itself 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 not very precise this is not important 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 our newspaper sheet and let's go 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.230
 then to put the finger inside the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.350
 divine rubber 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.160
 let's go and put it on pretty well and here 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 here we have our first finger 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.270
 of the hand 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.490
 let's do this for all of life 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.500
 so let 's take the measure of the second 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.800
 let's cut another piece of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.520
 newspaper they have on us 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.660
 without caccialupo and after having 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.000
 convolute 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.330
 we are going to put on this one 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 we do this of course for all 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.360
 how many do you say after you've done all 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.880
 how many fingers we have to do 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.489
 next step that is to fill the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.769
 farm for the palm trying to grow 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.769
 with a piece a little what they abound 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:18.910
 go get it inside 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.520
 of the hand try to give against the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.330
 texture and thickness of the hand 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400
 itself 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.770
 try to put in quantity 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.020
 enough to give you the 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.990
 size of a hand so they were 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.900
 finished doing the fingers but see how much 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.530
 has been here here is the hand as it should 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.270
 come up to this point after having it 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.230
 filled with paper we can move on to 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.510
 next step 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 let's take the hand and put it on 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.830
 our dish in such a way as to 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.890
 realize the size will have to 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.720
 arrive a little with levity out and then 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
 we will have to go and make the piece of 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.160
 arm below so we take 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.010
 We always go for the newspaper's success 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.070
 to roll up a little himself and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 let's put it inside the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.959
 hand this way 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.650
 you have some people you do nothing 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.540
 recently however it will have to be coated 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.820
 we try to do so that the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.310
 everything is fairly consistent ie 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.560
 that really has the size of a 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.260
 arm but still very simple will come 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.229
 natural to do it and then go 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.870
 with the scotch Benedictine very well 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.510
 any kind of tape to stick a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.810
 little to this part of joint between 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.090
 the glove and the paper in such a way that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.240
 we will be certain that he will not move when 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.610
 then we should go and put it on with the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.550
 aluminum paper 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:50.020
 so let's go and put these bezzini 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:52.900
 and then of course we are going to remove the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.530
 part in excess because as you see here 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.910
 comes out is a little too out and lawn 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.639
 then to cut the piece of newspaper 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.449
 coming out 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.710
 the new dish after cutting it 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.479
 here is the zombie arm ready for 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.999
 be beautiful covered by the sheet of 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.590
 children card so what do you 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.199
 I recommend making all the videos of 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.749
 starting from the fingers 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.020
 take those of the strips and 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:26.629
 we are going to make the cover ad 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.050
 outcome try not to be stingy in 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:33.409
 this case or aluminum foil 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.110
 because it will serve you abundantly 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.370
 such as to then give shape to yours 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.060
 zombie hand 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:48.860
 so let's cover all of them 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:53.180
 fingers even lines and then after 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:59.060
 all the fingers rejected will be the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:02.060
 turn of the palm coating you are looking for 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.849
 with the hands to give a little short to the 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.770
 tin foil in such a way as to give 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.770
 more the semblance of life 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:17.689
 then with the help of a piece these more 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:23.659
 great you dare to enrich the palm of the 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:26.020
 hand and of course if everything his 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.020
 arm 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:36.360
 after covering the pockets well 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:42.229
 help yourself with your hands to let go 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:46.199
 all blue our arm 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:49.020
 the tinfoil seek give body into 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.840
 so as to make the hand have 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:56.189
 more than the appearance we say smokes of 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.979
 zombies if you have any missing points 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:01.439
 add a little tinfoil add it e 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:05.210
 make sure that your work of 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.210
 August the impression of a house 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.020
 and so after covering it to see it 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.639
 our zombie hand ready even if yes 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860
 off a little bit some do not 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.599

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.250
 how much covered with ham 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.469
 the beauty of this zombie hand of 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.860
 aluminum and that we can give anyway 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:27.539
 to the fingers the position we want to like 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.560
 so you see that you also fall back on yourself 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.469
 same 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.180

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.699
