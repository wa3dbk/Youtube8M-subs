00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.390
 that will be cesc fabregas control 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.929
 new control 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.190
 the floor probably the most important part of the midfielder 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.499
 because be this apart 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.570
 that gives you time to think more about control is bad 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.090
 and already loses a lot of second debate cavez to tevez the move whenever he found 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.060
 be good 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.720
 no more how is really controlled with your party 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 Well, it will depend on matches of all kinds and more difficult matches more 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 easy 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.900
 but each one is different I think it's that you stop it sufficiently from 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.839
 capacity 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.579
 for every moment of your saying as against a match but it is clear that 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.580
 p the massive concentration 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.420
 and also of course that with the experience of the matches you are winning 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 there is someone who is the control of the party that really controls it 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.590
 you will see me many 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.280
 many people 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.249
 footballers who are able to sell control 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.190
 matches 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.320
 like blood 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 is for example 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.840
 a clear case of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.970
 of which party control you want 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 there are many footballers to everything 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.600
 at the global level that the po against the matches well as for example part 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.979
 of the museum management plan 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.859
 in this sense 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.859
 David or players that I fixed a lot like zidan 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.970
 guardiola chad iran there were many players who hates to find 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.180
 part of a way of ante 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.980
 In the selection, you told me, Andrey Andres, that he is in control of the 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.090
 selection 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.720
 is not one of them I think there are many players who are 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330
 trained for it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 of course that andres is one of them insist that doing it 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.079
 king is that for you is going to be the player who will write the future 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.770
 in the knowledgeable selection that 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.790
 right now we are all not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.100
 those of us who are creating the future of the PSOE says a lot that it is a team 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.950
 but they expect that in the individual 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.590
 Well, I hope you are good players, today they will do nothing. 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.709
 players who 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.280
 meanwhile working hard today the blockade that are still working 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.879
 so hard today, patience and humility 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.409
 the small are able to carry asencio has amassed will be able to see 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.259
 Well, you would like it to be the future of this selection 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.540
 I can not the future of the selection 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.200
 I would like him to go to the World Cup, of course I think there is nothing else 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.149
 Bigger than 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.969
 to win a world cup 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.299
 you wanted a young man who is starting playing 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.160
 in other currencies 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.620
 and it's that you have to do to get to play the spades selection and you're 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.729
 out to write future in the selection 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.020
 can beat 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.270
 to get to write the future young player has to 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.419
 to be patient 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.209
 of course the luck factor influences a lot but the dedication goes to work 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.289
 humility 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.619
 i also the patience not because we are all the time exposed to very impatient 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.569
 we want everything fast and now or more because good 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.709
 Well, the people 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.709
 the opportunity for very young kids every time 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.879
 we are more impatient Peruvian footballers 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.099
 I believe that all these qualities if you have them you have many possibilities 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.709
 of 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.849
 and césar them as those with the circumscribe the future 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.809
 how is a holiday 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.599
 well, only 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.409
 I will not be the one who tried to live day to day I do not think 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.709
 in Masaya then he came to write the future of the young man was trying 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.989
 to do well in the present I believe that the present is the key 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.809
 take it well the future and work the dedication 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.609
 which you like or not especially 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.199
 they enjoy playing football and that's the most important thing in that 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.059
 citi asked what is their future of the future statut of companies 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.119
 bonao in the future I hope to be in South Africa raising the world cup 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.480
 we come to imagine the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.780
 Cesc Fábregas score goal of the World Cup Spanish team 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.139
 What's up 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.139
 efe well I do not know what will happen the truth vogue 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.079
 none of the happiest days of your life 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.150
 iy good although it is very difficult 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.270
 that something so good pass 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.189
 to be to protect to score the goal of 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.400
 of victory would mean forest 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.490
 and believes that a whole country na 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.780
 has reached the highest this would mean therefore the most for me and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.379
 for all my classmates 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.680
 what happens if you fail 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.740
 how it affects you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.610
 if you fail then nothing to move forward 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.349
 the truth that it would be a stick or very hard but good 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.599
 ok this kind of weird stuff that 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.459
 also that he forgets them quickly I think that in soccer today this 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.559
 I hope you stay next to a radius of barely walks in what to beloved right 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.019
 boudou that they feel translated having a bad day now if the block and the mud is 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:06.109
 when he no longer writes the future because she - you do not keep thinking about the 

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:09.699
 past and Hebrew that this is not good but of course that would be a thing 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.900
 what are you carrying inside? 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.309
 the rest of your life of course 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.819
 you remember some special goal with a special victory 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.099
 good many barriers that 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.779
 I have not had the luck to live moments of incredible said one of them with the 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.529
 selection win the eurocopa was 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.300
 to another minor 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.060
 and some special fault here you do not have to think about it came in and in the end did not enter 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.600
 it's not that right now 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.960
 I have strong say no but good at the level of important match 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.810
 first because I have not scored many goals have finals or anything 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.059
 na 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:52.549
 because at the level of the party of the series of life now in the cup does it now 

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:54.569
 He said he had a bankrupt 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.020
 as many 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.249
 which of which I can regret but so that wang has been 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.460
 incredibly the star fito páez at the moment does not wait for what ever happens 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.689
 for this one efe
