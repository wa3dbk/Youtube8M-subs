 welcome to the new tutorial in this 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.680
 I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.599
 outline how to apply blush as 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.179
 can use a sponge to apply 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.039
 your base and finally how to apply your 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.409
 powder is super fast this tutorial 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.240
 I hope it helps them a lot because 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.040
 Usually when I do tutorials 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.290
 I start at once with my eyes and I 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.990
 finished the skin then you know how I 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.220
 I prepare my skin I hope you like a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 kiss and go with the tutorial 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.789
 yes 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.440
 good girls as a first step I'm going to 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.170
 use a concealer more then use 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 to cover those granites that I have as 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.059
 come they are super red but this concealer 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.280
 is infallible is super good because if 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.500
 see how it covers in a single pass in 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.570
 seriously I recommend them very much as 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 I told them I also covered my bags under 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.740
 that do not look so marked 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.490
 I'm going to take a brown concealer and I'm going to 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.960
 Apply under the cheekbone if 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.700
 you do not have a brown corrector 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.920
 there is no problem they can use a 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.200
 foundation of darker makeup and they do 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 circular movements to apply the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.970
 product as I show in the video 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.079
 I'm going to take the same concealer and I'm going 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.820
 to apply in the lateral areas of my 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.740
 nose because that will help me 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.369
 walk and look more restinga and more 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.369
 little girl 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.479
 this step is super important because what 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.000
 what I'm going to do is highlight my 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.000
 factions and hide my chin 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.900
 you can apply a little bit of 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.020
 corrector on the sides and your forehead is 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.759
 very big to make it look smaller 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 we have to make our face 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 see bright that's why we have to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.910
 contrast those dark tones we're going to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.940
 illuminate the part of the cheekbones the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.489
 nose forehead upper lip and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.500
 also the increase because these are the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.330
 high parts of the box- girls this 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.250
 can do for a special date 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.690
 for something that want to look different 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.610
 it's not that they do it every day 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 but if they like it and want to practice it 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 they can do it 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 it is important that we follow that product 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 in cream because we do not want the base 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.170
 do not expand the entire product and we 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.170
 says what we have already done 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.670
 I'm going to take a makeup base and a 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.799
 sponge and little touches will start 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 spread the product evenly in 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.670
 all my chain 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.230
 just like we did in step 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.180
 previous I'm going to seal that base so that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.320
 do not make folds or see me 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.320
 stitched the piece 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.040
 with a powder outline what I'm going to 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.140
 to do is highlight those again 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.329
 factions that I had already marked so that 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.040
 be noticed a little more and do not get lost 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.040
 with the even tone of the base 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.590
 with a brush what we are going to do is 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.599
 a 3 that goes from the front to the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.769
 bone of the cheekbone and bone of the cheekbone 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.769
 up to the jaw 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.120
 the blush can be applied in two ways 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.140
 basic first is in the form of l this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 it serves us girls that we are 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.340
 cachetona so it has the round face 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.319
 softens our features and makes them 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.000
 finest girls who have the 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.280
 Very sharp cheekbones can do it in 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.110
 Curve shape as seen by girls is very 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 easy and it is super natural and beautiful 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.489
 I hope you enjoyed leaving your 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.060
 little fingers up and your comments kisses 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.060
 bye
