00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
as far as v's go for defense max special

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.240 
as far as v's go for defense max special

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
attack and max speed easy souls are

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.559 
attack and max speed easy souls are
needed<00:02:21.609> to<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.239> thing<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.540> work

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
needed to get this thing to work

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.610 
needed to get this thing to work
properly<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.379> then<00:02:23.469> to<00:02:24.340> move<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.609> to<00:02:24.790> nature<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
properly and then to move on to nature I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.509 
properly and then to move on to nature I
gave<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.799> timid<00:02:27.159> nature<00:02:27.189> um<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:29.519> believe

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
gave it a timid nature um it I believe

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.289 
gave it a timid nature um it I believe
that<00:02:30.549> is<00:02:30.909> plus<00:02:31.420> special<00:02:31.840> attack<00:02:32.639> and<00:02:33.639> no<00:02:34.269> I

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
that is plus special attack and no I

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.990 
that is plus special attack and no I
believe<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.780> plus<00:02:35.049> speed<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.859> minus<00:02:36.099> attack

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
believe it's plus speed and minus attack

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.459 
believe it's plus speed and minus attack
i'm<00:02:37.180> not<00:02:37.299> sure<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.510> may<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:37.930> wrong<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
i'm not sure that may be wrong on the

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.849 
i'm not sure that may be wrong on the
screen<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.889> see<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.159> um<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.840> that's<00:02:41.709> a

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
screen you see now um and that's a

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.229 
screen you see now um and that's a
really<00:02:42.099> good<00:02:42.219> ability<00:02:42.579> because<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.849> I<00:02:43.030> mean

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
really good ability because you I mean

really good ability because you I mean
that's<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.629> good<00:02:43.719> in<00:02:43.840> nature<00:02:44.139> because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that's a really good in nature because

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.460 
that's a really good in nature because
you<00:02:44.530> don't<00:02:44.739> rely<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.930> attack<00:02:47.260> you're

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
you don't rely on your attack you're

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.699 
you don't rely on your attack you're
lying<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.799> your<00:02:47.859> special<00:02:48.129> attacks<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.709> that's

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
lying on your special attacks so that's

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.729

great<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.489> far<00:02:51.730> as<00:02:51.760> move<00:02:52.060> goes<00:02:52.389> moves<00:02:53.290> go<00:02:53.530> we

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
great as far as move goes moves go we

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.879 
great as far as move goes moves go we
have<00:02:53.919> butterfly<00:02:54.639> dance<00:02:55.409> it's<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.530> new<00:02:56.680> move

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
have butterfly dance it's a new move

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.179 
have butterfly dance it's a new move
introduced<00:02:57.669> this<00:02:57.879> gin<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.450> great<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.739> raises

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
introduced this gin it's great it raises

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.250 
introduced this gin it's great it raises
your<00:03:00.400> speed<00:03:02.310> special<00:03:03.310> attack<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:04.109> i'm<00:03:05.109> not

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
your speed special attack and i'm not

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.390 
your speed special attack and i'm not
sure<00:03:05.319> if<00:03:05.769> special<00:03:06.189> defense<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.669> raised<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:07.200> um

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
sure if special defense is raised to um

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.089 
sure if special defense is raised to um
but<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.669> raises<00:03:09.879> ghost<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> maybe<00:03:11.799> two

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
but it raises ghost I think it maybe two

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.979 
but it raises ghost I think it maybe two
or<00:03:12.129> three<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.510> good<00:03:13.659> move<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
or three but it's really good move to

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.509 
or three but it's really good move to

butterfly dance you know is gang from
speed<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.180> may<00:03:52.329> not<00:03:52.449> be<00:03:52.509> faster<00:03:52.900> than

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
speed it may not be faster than

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.099 
speed it may not be faster than
infernape<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:53.859> or<00:03:54.819> depends<00:03:55.299> on<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.479> item<00:03:55.840> but

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109

that's why we have HP ground um and

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.200 
that's why we have HP ground um and
infer<00:05:52.810> night<00:05:53.020> HP<00:05:53.860> ground<00:05:54.130> will<00:05:54.310> get<00:05:54.850> go
