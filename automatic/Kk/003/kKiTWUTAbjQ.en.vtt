00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Good day to present to you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 top 5 most strange 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.700
 moments mail at all pony friendship is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.269
 magic but don't judge it strictly mine 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.269
 humble opinion so 5th place 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 So 5th place we have 2 episodes of 4 seasons and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.689
 slight very noticeable was 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 get all funny look gaffe linked 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.660
 with animation so in one of the fall scenes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 discord show us discord joke 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.790
 here you are leaves when he steals and from canvas 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 it seems even during the first copy 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.519
 the scene and the exact 2 pieces then this tail 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 then in place and then no, this is surprising 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.420
 confusing but nonetheless it is not 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.049
 so scary so fifth place 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.049
 well deserved and so fourth place 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.550
 so in my version 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.670
 Art and place takes nightmares 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.010
 I will now explain why to us 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.070
 they say that the residents understood and in general 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.940
 All equestria celebrate a holiday in honor of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.580
 nightmar moon every year but how is it 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 fit with the first episode of season 1 where 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.220
 it is clear that the inhabitants 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.400
 appeared without any idea 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.200
 from your never know nightmare moon 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.210
 I do not know what it can be connected with 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.270
 but a clear plot hole here 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.100
 present so fourth place and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.100
 so 3 place 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.550
 so third place is not very 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.300
 suitable for the place though why not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.480
 suitable idiotic phrase 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.080
 designer of 14 series 1 season 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.080
 let's listen 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 second place 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.420
 in second place 13 series 3 seasons I'm not me 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.180
 nothing against the series itself 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.210
 not bad plot interesting musical 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.290
 rooms are good 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:03:01.780
 so cool but after the number pipe in it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 heard here rooster new did not show that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.080
 musical number here like thunder 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.250
 clear sky this phrase 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.580
 maybe I didn't understand something maybe i 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.950
 I didnâ€™t catch a new feature for me personally 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.950
 incomprehensible and because second place 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.360
 and so the first place is taken by the nephew 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.870
 Celeste just because I can't 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.250
 understand from here he could even take 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.710
 cook now i will reason with 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.680
 overdose of logic so so if he 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.840
 celestia's nephew so sit down and eat 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 only sister as far as I remember the princess 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.330
 the moon so that is what this nephew 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.870
 celeste is the son of the princess the moon and 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.260
 maybe it's certainly possible but to me it 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.830
 believes in me a net and believes hard 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.010
 honestly not even it seems i just 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.560
 I can not believe that then the father of this 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.420
 nephew it is completely incomprehensible but 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.510
 because well, I just can't understand it 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.330
 can not digest this information then 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.170
 this nephew where did he come from like him 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.690
 could even come from somewhere and appear 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.550
 it's all completely incomprehensible to me and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.550
 for this first place 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.030
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.949
