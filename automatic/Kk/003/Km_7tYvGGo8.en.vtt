hobby great stuff and toughy guys on
that<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> stuff<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.809> figured<00:00:34.200> I'd<00:00:34.320> do

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that kind of stuff I just figured I'd do

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
that kind of stuff I just figured I'd do
a<00:00:34.500> mod<00:00:35.280> series<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> toy<00:00:36.630> great<00:00:36.899> RC<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> anyway

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
a mod series on a toy great RC so anyway

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.440 
a mod series on a toy great RC so anyway
if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> look<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> back<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> previous

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
if you look at the back at the previous

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.380 
if you look at the back at the previous
series<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.780> talked<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> servo<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
series I talked about the servo and

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.220 
series I talked about the servo and
talked<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.140> with

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
talked about what I was going to do with

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.180 
talked about what I was going to do with
it<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.500> stuff

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it and stuff

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
it and stuff
so<00:00:47.640> I've<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.329> completed<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.140> servo

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so I've actually completed the servo

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.610 
so I've actually completed the servo
being<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.989> check<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.440> last

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
being in there if you check out the last

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
being in there if you check out the last
video<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.219> remembered<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.390> saying<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.020> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
video you remembered me saying that I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.729 
video you remembered me saying that I
was<00:00:55.980> gonna<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.190> two<00:00:56.610> screws<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
was gonna put two screws in there and I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.590 
was gonna put two screws in there and I
did<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> servo<00:00:59.820> horn<00:00:59.940> moves<00:01:00.359> like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
did so now the servo horn moves like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
did so now the servo horn moves like
that<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> steering's<00:01:02.670> gonna

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that so that's how the steering's gonna

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
that so that's how the steering's gonna
work<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> two<00:01:03.719> screws<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.140> pivoted

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
work so the two screws are pivoted

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
work so the two screws are pivoted
inside<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> pole<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.119> those<00:01:06.330> aren't<00:01:06.570> moving

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
inside that pole so those aren't moving

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
inside that pole so those aren't moving
either<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.439> something<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:07.890> simple

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
either it's just something that's simple

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500 
either it's just something that's simple
and<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> work<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and that's how it's going to work so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.660 
and that's how it's going to work so
let's<00:01:09.570> hitch<00:01:09.750> mount<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> bottom<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
let's hitch mount on the bottom there so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
let's hitch mount on the bottom there so
and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.060> ran<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> servo<00:01:12.720> lead<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and then I ran the servo lead up to the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.300 
and then I ran the servo lead up to the
front<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.920> through<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.189> hole

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
front here and through this little hole

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
front here and through this little hole
and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.180> running<00:01:18.390> am<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and then it's just running am like I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520 
and then it's just running am like I
said<00:01:19.290> before<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> Traxxas<00:01:21.530> speed

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
said before I got the Traxxas speed

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.730 
said before I got the Traxxas speed
controller<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.220> xl5<00:01:23.759> wired<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> parallel

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
controller here xl5 wired up in parallel

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.910 
controller here xl5 wired up in parallel
to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.640> two<00:01:26.790> motors<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to the two motors here so now I just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.069 
to the two motors here so now I just
need<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> mount<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> battery<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> crystals

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
need to mount the battery and crystals

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.240 
need to mount the battery and crystals
in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> radio<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:31.890> pretty<00:01:32.070> much

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
in the radio and that's pretty much

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.179 
in the radio and that's pretty much
about<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.079> I'll<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.229> doing<00:01:34.560> another<00:01:34.619> video

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
about it so I'll be doing another video
