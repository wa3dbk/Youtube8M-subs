00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 today I would like you to do the next 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.740
 video from vaz car repair series 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.130
 2115 so that these would not show you 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.160
 happens to owners 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 there is such a problem that the back 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 front seat does not fall that is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 we have a special lever here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 which we twist and the back should 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 go down as you see now here i am 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 twist 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.050
 must twist counterclockwise she 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 should go down she doesn't go down 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.899
 cooler so who doesn't fall now 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 show you in the driver's seat there everything 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:51.570
 on the contrary here is the same back here I twist 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.960
 and from the seat up comes i twist the seat 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.750
 goes down there we also exist 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.180
 the problem is that the back is stronger 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.070
 the seats don't react so need 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.369
 make it pretty simple for us 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 need a screwdriver to remove 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.430
 protective cover and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.659
 the key for 10 is nothing complicated there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.659
 do any without helpers and what here 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.659
 this 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 actuated item which 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.390
 lets back 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.479
 what to do u need to take off 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.530
 first protective 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.119
 protective cover take here like this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 neatly picks up a screwdriver so 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:42.060
 the main thing so far nothing breaks off easily 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.290
 all shoot here it looks like or not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 lost and that's what we see here 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.710
 peculiar due to her she turns 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.360
 what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.880
 what happens is that the back does not fall 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.540
 this is loosened the bolt here it is mold you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.509
 see at 10 take the key and or all 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 elementary we just pull it up 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 clockwise pulls up 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 bolt pull up start before 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.690
 the seat will go up here you will see i 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.190
 night pull up look and seat 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.160
 begins to move as well as you can 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.050
 stop here with your hand and another 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.680
 stronger but now i can't since i 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.690
 I take one because I hold the camera and take off 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.180
 here you do all this up to this point 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.870
 delayed she keeps taking back 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:53.370
 our plastic protection and neat 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:56.160
 we return it to its place so I want to notice 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.310
 that back it is put much more difficult 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:11.640
 what is removed I was carried very long 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:14.640
 so the main thing to get into the slots so here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.000
 so I got everything in place and that we 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.510
 now we have a seat here i twist like 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.500
 see it goes down and twist back 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.850
 the seat goes down everything is fine 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.850
 it works like this
