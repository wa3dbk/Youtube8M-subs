00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
wouldn't know what sanji of AC is well

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.230 
wouldn't know what sanji of AC is well
here's<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.290> gets<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.619> interesting

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
here's where it gets really interesting

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
here's where it gets really interesting
santi<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> AC<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> chianti<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.170> basically

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
santi of AC and chianti are basically

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.270 
santi of AC and chianti are basically
exactly<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.119> same<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:34.009> chianti<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
exactly the same thing chianti is a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
exactly the same thing chianti is a
hundred<00:01:35.939> percent<00:01:36.000> century<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> AC<00:01:36.750> that's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hundred percent century of AC that's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.550 
hundred percent century of AC that's
grown<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> Chianti<00:01:38.939> region<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> Italy<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
grown in the Chianti region of Italy so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
grown in the Chianti region of Italy so
the<00:01:40.680> only<00:01:40.860> difference<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.549> where<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> grapes

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the only difference is where the grapes
