00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.619 
up and their collapse so we just see the
actual<00:02:08.190> title<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:08.940> sweet<00:02:09.179> itself<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
actual title and then sweet itself and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.090 
actual title and then sweet itself and
then<00:02:09.720> when<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> scroll<00:02:10.170> over<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.530> expand

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
then when you scroll over to expand

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.090 
then when you scroll over to expand
so<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.820> interesting<00:02:12.360> concept<00:02:13.170> it's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
so it's interesting concept it's

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.920 
so it's interesting concept it's
actually<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.850> annoying<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.390> trouble<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
actually kind of annoying and trouble to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.310 
actually kind of annoying and trouble to
get<00:02:16.110> used<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.800> some<00:02:17.640> people<00:02:17.910> may<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.060> it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
get used to but some people may like it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.600 
get used to but some people may like it
