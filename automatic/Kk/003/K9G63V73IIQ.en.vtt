different cities in the south like New

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380 
different cities in the south like New
Orleans<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.260> Houston<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.789> kept<00:00:21.029> ended<00:00:21.270> up

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
Orleans in Houston and I kept ended up

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.970 
Orleans in Houston and I kept ended up
in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.810> place<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.500> told<00:00:22.710> me<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> needed

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
in the same place they told me I needed

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
in the same place they told me I needed
a<00:00:23.070> cornea<00:00:23.400> transplant<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.019> wasn't<00:00:25.199> ready

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a cornea transplant and I wasn't ready

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.519 
a cornea transplant and I wasn't ready
to<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:27.180> mom<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> internet

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to do that so my mom got on the internet

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.410 
to do that so my mom got on the internet
and<00:00:28.560> did<00:00:28.859> research<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:29.970> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and did research for me because it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
and did research for me because it's
pretty<00:00:30.840> tough<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.769> research<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
pretty tough to do research on the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240 
pretty tough to do research on the
internet<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:32.969> you're<00:00:33.090> keratoconus<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
internet when you're keratoconus but we

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
internet when you're keratoconus but we
found<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.420> tax<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
found out about in tax and so the at the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
found out about in tax and so the at the
point<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.079> was<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.770> decided<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.000> wanted

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
point I was at I decided that I wanted

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
point I was at I decided that I wanted
to<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> best<00:00:43.050> doctor<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.010> tax<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to go to the best doctor for in tax and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
to go to the best doctor for in tax and
so<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.090> narrowed<00:00:45.420> our<00:00:45.510> choices<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
so we narrowed our choices down and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
so we narrowed our choices down and
that's<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> found<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.910> two<00:00:48.059> Rabinowitz

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that's how I found out two Rabinowitz

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.310 
that's how I found out two Rabinowitz
because<00:00:49.050> he<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> go-to<00:00:50.969> doctor<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.079> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
because he was the go-to doctor for in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
because he was the go-to doctor for in
tags<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.949> didn't<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
tags and I didn't want to look back and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
tags and I didn't want to look back and
think<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> road<00:00:55.170> gosh<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.800> had<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
think down the road gosh if I had just

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
think down the road gosh if I had just
seen<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.550> doctor<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.420> been

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
seen the right doctor it would have been

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.860 
seen the right doctor it would have been
different<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> had<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.609> tax<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.359> planted

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
different so I had in tax and planted
probably<00:01:01.050> four<00:01:01.559> years<00:01:01.800> ago<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.600> they

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
probably four years ago and they

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.460 
probably four years ago and they
definitely<00:01:04.129> improved<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.880> vision<00:01:06.470> uncorrect

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
definitely improved my vision uncorrect

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
definitely improved my vision uncorrect
it<00:01:07.590> glasses<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.100> help<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to rely on contact lenses so it's really

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
to rely on contact lenses so it's really
nice<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.630> tired<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.320> he

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
nice that when I was tired and then he

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.249 
nice that when I was tired and then he
took<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> contacts<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.020> able<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
took the contacts out that I was able to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
took the contacts out that I was able to
see<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.890> better<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.259> I've<00:01:19.259> been

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.120 
lenses and it's doing pretty well until
this<00:01:27.630> year<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> year<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.040> bit

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

harder and so when we came to see dr.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
harder and so when we came to see dr.
Rabinowitz<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.250> our<00:01:32.520> visit<00:01:33.090> he<00:01:33.540> said<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.869> left

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
Rabinowitz for our visit he said my left

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
Rabinowitz for our visit he said my left
eye<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.530> definitely<00:01:35.100> progressing<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
eye was definitely progressing again and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
eye was definitely progressing again and
it<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.710> cross-linking<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it was time to try the cross-linking and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.530 
it was time to try the cross-linking and
I've<00:01:38.790> been<00:01:38.970> reading<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
I've been reading about the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
I've been reading about the
cross-linking<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.670> pretty

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
cross-linking and so I was pretty

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.950 
cross-linking and so I was pretty
excited<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> able<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> try<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.960> as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
excited to be able to try this and as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
excited to be able to try this and as
far<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> procedure<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.640> pretty

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
far as the procedure I was pretty

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.999 
far as the procedure I was pretty
nervous<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.630> hadn't<00:01:48.990> worked<00:01:49.079> myself<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
nervous I hadn't worked myself up into a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
nervous I hadn't worked myself up into a
pretty<00:01:50.700> big<00:01:50.790> nervous<00:01:51.450> state<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
pretty big nervous state because I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.100 
pretty big nervous state because I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
thought gosh she's going to scrape off

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
thought gosh she's going to scrape off
part<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.290> eye<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.250> I'm<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
part of my eye and then I'm going to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
part of my eye and then I'm going to
have<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> stare<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> light<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
have to stare a light I'm so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.389 
have to stare a light I'm so
light-sensitive<00:01:59.189> already<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:01.310> pretty<00:02:02.310> much

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
light-sensitive already so I pretty much

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.060 
light-sensitive already so I pretty much
worst-case<00:02:02.880> scenario<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> whole<00:02:03.990> event<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
worst-case scenario as a whole event and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.479 
worst-case scenario as a whole event and
it<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.399> very<00:02:06.000> easy<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> scraping<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
it was very easy that the scraping that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:08.900 
it was very easy that the scraping that
was<00:02:08.640> not

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
was not

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.360 
was not
painful<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.720> completely<00:02:10.140> numb<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
painful I was completely numb and so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.340 
painful I was completely numb and so
that<00:02:12.240> wasn't<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.540> problem<00:02:12.570> at<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that wasn't a problem at all in the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.550 
that wasn't a problem at all in the
light<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.980> wouldn't<00:02:14.730> even<00:02:14.790> call<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.180> light<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
light I wouldn't even call it a light it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.340 
light I wouldn't even call it a light it
was<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:18.000> light<00:02:18.180> sensitivity<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:19.110> just

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
was so for light sensitivity it's just

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.930 
was so for light sensitivity it's just
it's<00:02:19.500> not<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.710> problem

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
