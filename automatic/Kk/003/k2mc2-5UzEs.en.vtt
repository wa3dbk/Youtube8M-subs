very<00:02:27.660> rhythmic<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.380> fun<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.010> get<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.730> your

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
very rhythmic it's fun to get out your

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.600 
very rhythmic it's fun to get out your
tap<00:02:30.420> shoes<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.050> exercise<00:02:32.040> those<00:02:32.280> those

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
tap shoes and exercise those those

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.340
