00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
character and see if I can enter the

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.060 
character and see if I can enter the
world<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.890> warcraft<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.990> everything<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.830> good

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
one a bit lonely but anyways let's try

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.639 
one a bit lonely but anyways let's try
out<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.399> other<00:01:45.549> account<00:01:46.060> which<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.479> in<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.020> GM

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
out the other account which is in the GM

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.669 
out the other account which is in the GM
and<00:01:47.799> let's<00:01:48.549> see<00:01:48.759> if<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.140> count<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.350> join<00:01:50.530> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
and let's see if that count can join the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:58.480 
and let's see if that count can join the
server

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.770 

okay<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.619> quiz<00:02:00.619> for<00:02:00.649> which<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:02.149> be<00:02:02.270> possible

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
okay a quiz for which can be possible

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.960 
okay a quiz for which can be possible
since<00:02:03.020> there<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.619> no<00:02:03.649> one<00:02:04.159> on<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.030> rim<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:07.490> as

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
since there is no one on the rim but as

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.880 
since there is no one on the rim but as
you<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.239> see<00:02:08.539> i'm<00:02:08.720> not<00:02:08.869> able<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.440> join<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
you can see i'm not able to join the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.120 
you can see i'm not able to join the
Rams<00:02:10.099> since<00:02:10.550> i'm<00:02:10.789> not<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.209> GM<00:02:11.590> which<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.830> pretty
