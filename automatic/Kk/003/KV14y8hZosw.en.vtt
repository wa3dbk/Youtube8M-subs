00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
great but before I give you this tip the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.120 
great but before I give you this tip the
first<00:00:12.900> thing<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.559> recommend<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
first thing that I would recommend to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
first thing that I would recommend to
you<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.549> find<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.269> sensitivity<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.020> you

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you is to find a sensitivity that you

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.950 
you is to find a sensitivity that you
like<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.590> stay<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:16.980> sensitivity

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
like and stay with that sensitivity

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.210 
like and stay with that sensitivity
personally<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> would<00:00:19.380> go<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
personally I would go with one in the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.580 
personally I would go with one in the
middle<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.180> seven<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.750> eight<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.199> plan

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
middle like a seven or an eight I plan

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.900 
middle like a seven or an eight I plan
on<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:22.769> eight<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.699> bit

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
on an eight just to have a little bit

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.480 
on an eight just to have a little bit
faster<00:00:24.590> turnaround<00:00:25.590> speed<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> need<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
faster turnaround speed if I need it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
faster turnaround speed if I need it
while<00:00:26.939> still<00:00:27.269> having<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:28.019> control<00:00:28.830> like

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
while still having my control like

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
during long range shots and stuff but
yeah<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.800> find<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.369> sensitivity<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
yeah just find a sensitivity that you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.209 
yeah just find a sensitivity that you
are<00:00:33.360> comfortable<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> said<00:00:35.070> this

tip on how to improve your aim and that
is<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:39.989> using<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> precise<00:00:41.219> weapons<00:00:41.640> within

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is just using the precise weapons within

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
is just using the precise weapons within
a<00:00:42.270> particular<00:00:43.020> call<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.649> duty<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:43.950> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
a particular call of duty in this

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
a particular call of duty in this
instance<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:44.789> playing<00:00:45.149> black<00:00:45.480> ops<00:00:45.510> 2<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
instance we're playing black ops 2 and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.060 
instance we're playing black ops 2 and
in<00:00:46.590> black<00:00:46.800> ops<00:00:47.010> 2<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.489> KSG<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.690> FAL<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> SMR

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in black ops 2 the KSG the FAL the SMR

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
in black ops 2 the KSG the FAL the SMR
those<00:00:50.850> are<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.690> guns<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
those are all really good guns to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
those are all really good guns to
improve<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.680> aim<00:00:52.879> especially<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.210> KSG

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
improve your aim especially the KSG

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.110 
improve your aim especially the KSG
because<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.370> miss<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.699> shots<00:00:56.940> you're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
because it if you miss your shots you're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
because it if you miss your shots you're
gonna<00:00:57.239> die<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.289> practice

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
gonna die so you need to really practice

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
gonna die so you need to really practice
hitting<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.430> shots<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:01.140> guns

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
for about an hour to or at least like 30

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
for about an hour to or at least like 30
minutes<00:01:05.159> before<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:06.090> using

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
minutes before you actually start using

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.320 
minutes before you actually start using
your<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.780> guns<00:01:07.049> you'll<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:09.150> good

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
your other guns you'll see a pretty good

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
your other guns you'll see a pretty good
improvement<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:09.960> aim<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.860> aim

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
will just get better overall because

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
will just get better overall because
you'll<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.750> patient<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.500> shots

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you'll be more patient with your shots

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.440 
you'll be more patient with your shots
and<00:01:14.400> you'll<00:01:14.580> make<00:01:14.729> more<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.210> actually

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and you'll make more of them actually

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.140 
and you'll make more of them actually
count<00:01:15.930> hopefully<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.610> yeah<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:17.939> pretty

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
count hopefully but yeah that's pretty

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
count hopefully but yeah that's pretty
