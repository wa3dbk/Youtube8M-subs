00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
actual game here rather generic game

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
actual game here rather generic game
case<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.470> complaining

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
case but you know what not complaining

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.120 
case but you know what not complaining
about<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:30.020> then<00:01:31.020> there's<00:01:31.200> also<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
about that then there's also the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.120 
about that then there's also the
Infinity<00:01:32.640> base<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:34.740> looks<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
Infinity base right here it looks a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
Infinity base right here it looks a
little<00:01:35.310> bit<00:01:35.579> smaller<00:01:35.939> than<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.560> original

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
little bit smaller than the original

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
little bit smaller than the original
infinity<00:01:38.579> base<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.630> wrong<00:01:39.810> it's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
infinity base but I could be wrong it's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.380 
infinity base but I could be wrong it's
been<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> while<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.460> yeah<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> basically

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
been a while but yeah this is basically

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
been a while but yeah this is basically
what<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.229> sit<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> Disney<00:01:44.009> infinity

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
characters on and they magically appear

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
characters on and they magically appear
