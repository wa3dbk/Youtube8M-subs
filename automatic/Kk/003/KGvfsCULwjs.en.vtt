before<00:02:14.110> applying<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.890> designs<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.060> way<00:02:16.239> I

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
before applying the designs so the way I

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.350 
before applying the designs so the way I
apply<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> heart<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:18.459> draw<00:02:18.640> two<00:02:18.910> lines<00:02:19.150> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
apply the heart is I draw two lines in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.210 
apply the heart is I draw two lines in
the<00:02:19.450> opposite<00:02:19.989> direction<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.620> each<00:02:20.739> other<00:02:20.950> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the opposite direction of each other and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.850 
the opposite direction of each other and
then<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.610> build<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> up<00:02:22.299> from<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
then I just build it up from here and it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.320 
then I just build it up from here and it
might<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.400> little<00:02:24.459> practice<00:02:25.030> because

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
might take you a little practice because

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.539 
might take you a little practice because
believe<00:02:25.930> me<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.350> took<00:02:26.650> me<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.010> lot<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.280> practice

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
believe me it took me a lot of practice

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.990 
believe me it took me a lot of practice
to<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:29.040> once<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.850> don't

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
to do this and once you get it you don't
forget<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.600> sort<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.380> know<00:02:32.410> riding<00:02:32.769> a

polish the glitter around the hearts I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.350 
polish the glitter around the hearts I
just<00:04:35.190> thought<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.520> would<00:04:35.640> be<00:04:35.760> extra<00:04:36.180> glitter

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
just thought it would be extra glitter

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.030 
just thought it would be extra glitter
full<00:04:36.630> because<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.290> just<00:04:37.560> me

full because that's just me
and<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.310> know<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.850> really<00:04:39.360> don't<00:04:39.540> think

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
and you know what I really don't think

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.750 
and you know what I really don't think
anything<00:04:40.530> could<00:04:40.740> ever<00:04:40.800> have<00:04:41.340> too<00:04:41.580> much

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
anything could ever have too much

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.430 
anything could ever have too much
glitter<00:04:41.970> because<00:04:42.240> glitter<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.260> most

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
glitter because glitter is the most

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.600 
glitter because glitter is the most
amazing<00:04:43.650> thing<00:04:43.860> in<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.160> world

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
amazing thing in the world

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.150 
amazing thing in the world
so<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.420> kind<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.690> made<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.870> little<00:04:45.990> booboo<00:04:46.830> there

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
so I kind of made a little booboo there

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520 
so I kind of made a little booboo there
by<00:04:47.460> drowning<00:04:47.880> my<00:04:48.270> heart<00:04:48.600> with<00:04:49.080> too<00:04:49.320> much

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
by drowning my heart with too much

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.770 
by drowning my heart with too much
glitter<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.640> went<00:04:50.880> ahead<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.120> gave<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.600> some

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
glitter so I went ahead and gave it some

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.120 
glitter so I went ahead and gave it some
room<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.110> breathe<00:04:52.140> because<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.680> didn't<00:04:52.920> want<00:04:53.040> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
room to breathe because I didn't want to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.100 
room to breathe because I didn't want to
die<00:04:53.430> from<00:04:53.730> glitter<00:04:53.970> ex-fix<00:04:54.450> iation
