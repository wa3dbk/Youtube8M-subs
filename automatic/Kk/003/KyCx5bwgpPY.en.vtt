00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.430
 for now it just looks like a pit 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.169
 dug in the middle of the taiga but after two 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 this will be one of the most 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.280
 priority objects 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.070
 Russian Federation here on the far 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 east they are far from Blagoveshchensk 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.849
 build a new oriental cosmodrome 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 an ambitious project that highlighted 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.900
 more than 300 billion rubles 10 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.269
 billion dollars and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.179
 according to officials from the cosmos roses to 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.220
 2018 from here all will be launched 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.589
 Russian manned space objects 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 it will make a big difference 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.040
 existing at the moment because 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.380
 Now Russia has to use 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.270
 Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan skim and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.130
 every year russia pays about 600 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 million dollars for use for 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.970
 rent a cosmodrome on baikonur 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 definitely building your own 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.690
 the spaceport will greatly facilitate the situation for 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 Russia because there have already been cases when 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 political decisions 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.890
 Astana blocked Russian launch 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 satellites and manned spacecraft 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 devices certainly when will 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 built your own spaceport 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 which will answer the last word 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.170
 technology unlike baykonur and where 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.359
 most equipment is already moral and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.609
 technically outdated and it will be for 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:10.320
 Russia will definitely be a big plus 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.359
 negative moments like 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.329
 transportation of spacecraft from 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.420
 Moscow region where they are collected on 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.119
 the moment to deliver for example 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 rocket or satellite to baykonur this 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 It takes a few days because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.179
 Distance from Moscow to Baikonur 200 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.909
 thousand kilometers to here yes amur 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.289
 areas to the oriental cosmodrome five with 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.909
 half thousand kilometers i have two 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.759
 times longer surely it will and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.159
 cost more but still economic 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.049
 component of these transportation 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.359
 this difference is not so significant 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.979
 a messenger of what economic plus and 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.209
 Russia's economic benefits will be 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.679
 representation of its own 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.979
 spaceport in the far east 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.090
 but perhaps the most important advantage of the new 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 own oriental cosmodrome 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.880
 in the far east will be his participation 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.740
 Russian lunar program precisely 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.499
 from here manned ships will 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 run to the moon by 2030 as on 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.570
 This moment promises Roskosmos 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.460
 the ship will fly 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.330
 fly around the moon several times and maybe 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.280
 even as scientists say will choose 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 construction site for an observatory on 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.390
 surface of the moon behind the observatory 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.940
 helium mines may follow 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.570
 5 which is possible at some stage 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.370
 will become a new energy resource for 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.310
 of the whole planet earth remains of course 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.360
 even until 2030 see how 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.280
 how successful will this program be 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 these plans will be realized but what 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
 the moon ship will be launched exactly 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.230
 from here it is from the oriental cosmodrome 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 which will finish in two years 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.880
 that's for sure
