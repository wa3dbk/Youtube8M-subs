00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
I was gonna do that or not but I decided

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.780 
I was gonna do that or not but I decided
to<00:00:27.230> do<00:00:27.349> it<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:29.050> voila<00:00:31.329> here<00:00:32.329> we<00:00:32.450> are<00:00:33.579> it<00:00:34.579> looks

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
to do it so voila here we are it looks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.660 
to do it so voila here we are it looks
pretty<00:00:35.059> good<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.329> think<00:00:39.219> remember<00:00:40.219> when<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.399> said

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
pretty good I think remember when I said

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.009 
pretty good I think remember when I said
we<00:00:40.789> had<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:40.969> light<00:00:41.120> table<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:41.719> took<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
we had to light table and we took the

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.910 
we had to light table and we took the
green<00:00:42.289> and<00:00:42.589> the<00:00:42.829> yellow<00:00:42.859> and<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:45.620> could<00:00:45.769> see

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
green and the yellow and you could see

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.959 
green and the yellow and you could see
that<00:00:46.039> it<00:00:46.129> would<00:00:46.190> make<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.550> look<00:00:46.699> like<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
that it would make it look like the

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.110 
that it would make it look like the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
whenever I take my yeah I cut things to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.170 
whenever I take my yeah I cut things to
the<00:02:37.050> link<00:02:37.200> they<00:02:37.410> put<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.739> here<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.730> 45

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the link they put it in here that's a 45

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.930 
the link they put it in here that's a 45
and<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.110> then<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> other<00:02:40.709> side<00:02:40.940> you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and then and then on the other side you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.610 
and then and then on the other side you
just<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.360> way<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> way<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.140> don't

just do it this way that way I don't
have<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.860> keep<00:02:44.100> moving<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.519> handle<00:02:45.140> from<00:02:46.140> side

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
have to keep moving the handle from side

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.620 
have to keep moving the handle from side
to<00:02:46.440> side<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:47.690> keep<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:50.420> before<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.510> get

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
to side to keep going but before you get

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.870 
to side to keep going but before you get
that<00:02:52.080> then<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.470> use<00:02:52.650> my<00:02:52.680> my<00:02:53.250> router<00:02:53.489> which<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that then I use my my router which I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.060 
that then I use my my router which I
store<00:02:54.239> down<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.750> my<00:02:54.870> router<00:02:55.110> table<00:02:55.380> which<00:02:55.950> is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
store down here my router table which is

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.350 
store down here my router table which is
a<00:02:56.100> router<00:02:56.400> underneath<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.360> this

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
a router underneath it and now you this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.150 
a router underneath it and now you this
is<00:03:00.540> where<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.989> most<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> frame<00:03:01.950> making

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
is where the most of the frame making

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150 
is where the most of the frame making
process<00:03:02.640> has<00:03:02.820> dealt<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.920> table

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
process has dealt it is is on this table

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.190 
process has dealt it is is on this table
right<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> said<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.480> left<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.080> the

it and you know I was telling you about

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.920 
it and you know I was telling you about
the<00:04:13.069> this<00:04:14.069> has<00:04:14.250> six<00:04:14.760> different<00:04:14.909> router<00:04:15.659> bits

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
the this has six different router bits

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.740 
the this has six different router bits
so<00:04:16.229> one<00:04:16.799> would<00:04:16.919> be<00:04:17.039> on<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.280> on<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.699> face<00:04:17.970> this

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
so one would be on the on this face this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.920 
so one would be on the on this face this
little<00:04:19.019> quarter<00:04:19.620> bead<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:21.209> groover<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.840> the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
little quarter bead this groover on the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.430
