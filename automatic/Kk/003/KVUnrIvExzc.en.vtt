00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.440 
interact it would be music back in the
early<00:01:19.280> days<00:01:19.430> when<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.700> firework<00:01:20.090> shows<00:01:20.270> were

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
early days when the firework shows were

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.480 
early days when the firework shows were
first<00:01:20.660> introduced<00:01:21.140> at<00:01:21.259> Magic<00:01:21.560> Kingdom<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
first introduced at Magic Kingdom the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.279 
first introduced at Magic Kingdom the
shows<00:01:22.759> were<00:01:23.030> fired<00:01:23.270> manually<00:01:23.899> by<00:01:24.259> a

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
shows were fired manually by a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.350 
shows were fired manually by a
technician<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.369> there<00:01:25.580> was<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.729> lot<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.060> human

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
technician so there was a lot of human

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.109 
technician so there was a lot of human
interaction<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.350> firing<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.890> show

interaction with the firing of the show
we've<00:01:29.119> now<00:01:29.479> since<00:01:29.810> evolved<00:01:30.410> from<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:30.950> kind

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
we've now since evolved from that kind

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.010 
we've now since evolved from that kind
of<00:01:31.399> technology<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:31.970> where<00:01:32.300> we<00:01:32.420> actually<00:01:32.599> can

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
of technology to where we actually can

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.930 
of technology to where we actually can
choreograph<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.979> show<00:01:34.160> on<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.399> computer

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
choreograph the show on a computer

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.990 
choreograph the show on a computer
pinpoint<00:01:35.899> accuracy<00:01:36.679> for<00:01:37.069> timing<00:01:37.429> for<00:01:37.789> all<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
pinpoint accuracy for timing for all the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.150 
pinpoint accuracy for timing for all the
shells<00:01:38.240> much<00:01:39.140> better<00:01:39.380> than<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:39.860> used<00:01:40.039> to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
shells much better than what we used to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.529 
shells much better than what we used to
do<00:01:40.310> we've<00:01:40.789> come<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> long<00:01:41.030> way

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
do we've come a long way

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.440 
do we've come a long way
I<00:01:41.569> think<00:01:42.470> Walt<00:01:42.770> would<00:01:42.950> be<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.520> static<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.300> what

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
I think Walt would be a static of what

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.270 
I think Walt would be a static of what
we've<00:01:44.599> done<00:01:44.810> over<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.200> last<00:01:45.349> 40<00:01:45.740> years

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
we've done over the last 40 years

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.010 
we've done over the last 40 years
when<00:01:46.459> wall<00:01:46.729> was<00:01:46.910> around<00:01:47.240> we<00:01:47.630> didn't<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:47.929> any

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
when wall was around we didn't have any

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.270 
when wall was around we didn't have any
of<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.170> technology<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.770> we<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:49.039> right<00:01:49.250> now

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
of the technology that we have right now
