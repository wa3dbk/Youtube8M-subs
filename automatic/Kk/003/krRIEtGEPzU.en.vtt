 extreme poverty that is the problem never 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.970
 will have a solution while they see the town 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.880
 only as a vote while spending thousands

 in their candidacy children sleep and eat 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.259
 pray for justice and no longer want to see 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
 more deaths in the news to the

 that for years have claimed the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.140
 injustices of the conflict brothers for 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.330

 rest that is from earth to heaven the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.250
 voice of my people we leave the town I 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.950
 I come from where this hides in the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.600
 hunger poverty is the name the shadow 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 of the man who is always present 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.240
 between the sorrows of my land does not exist 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.670
 Calm freedom calms the heart of 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.550
 people today nothing protects us shoots 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.770
 without fear the struggle for power costs 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.350
 whatever the cost, life is forgotten and 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.570
 breathes death in my town we continue 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.580
 being the employee repressed the 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.250
 peasant marginalized the vagabond 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.070
 despised we remain forgotten with 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.230
 Bloodstained streets at sunrise and 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.480
 apparently nobody cares who suffers 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.210
 this sentence is a price to pay for 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.580
 Silence the fear of being able to continue living in 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.370
 this shit I do not believe it more and more 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.520
 away from heaven increasingly well the 5 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.650
 heaven without future without hope today all 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.170
 a world turned into a lost 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.430
 cemetery is a serious problem that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.379
 nobody takes seriously 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.930
 about the criteria justice is a 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.569
 mystery an unresolved case a problem 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.000
 loose we die with our hands and feet 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.519
 bound we are condemned with the weight of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.430
 our sins today we return the hook 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.799
 the dirty money the vices of this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.780
 ground today everything is lost 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.030
 I wait for me in silence while I sleep 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.340
 so that everything changes awake and I do not 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.280
 like what I see everything is a desert 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.049
 tell me growth if after so much 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.989
 there's no time to breathe 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.039
 quiet open your eyes to this world in 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.440
 his cruel delirium is not my voice is the voice 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.870
 what friends has possessed is the means 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.870
 found to reach your ears the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.479
 rest burning from earth to heaven the voice 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.030
 of my people we leave the town is my 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.190
 voice is the voice that my voice has possessed is 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.940
 the means you found to reach your 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.759
 ears 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:46.430
 the prisoner is from earth to heaven 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.430
 voice of my people we go from the town 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.470
 Dead paradise back
