00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
then at this point I can from the back

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.059 
then at this point I can from the back
pull<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.060> end<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.989> my<00:01:51.080> starting<00:01:51.380> chain<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
that gets rid of that hole both gets rid

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.340 
that gets rid of that hole both gets rid
of<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.119> hole<00:01:57.129> in<00:01:58.129> the<00:01:58.670> middle

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of that hole in the middle

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.320 
of that hole in the middle
so<00:02:00.950> now<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.190> make<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.640> point<00:02:03.580> this<00:02:04.580> chain<00:02:04.940> four

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
so now to make the point this chain four

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.889 
so now to make the point this chain four
two<00:02:06.850> three<00:02:07.850> four

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
two three four

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.250 
two three four
and<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.920> slip<00:02:10.250> stitch<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.450> second<00:02:12.080> chain

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
and you slip stitch in the second chain

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.650 
and you slip stitch in the second chain
from<00:02:12.290> hook<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.430> can't<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.880> anything<00:02:14.300> with

my<00:04:09.820> m<00:04:10.180> chain<00:04:11.110> -<00:04:11.380> I'm<00:04:11.920> gonna<00:04:12.070> cut<00:04:12.370> back<00:04:12.550> here

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
my m chain - I'm gonna cut back here

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.349 
my m chain - I'm gonna cut back here
it's<00:04:13.780> about<00:04:13.900> five<00:04:14.230> inches<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.010> leave<00:04:15.359> and

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
it's about five inches that I leave and

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.789 
it's about five inches that I leave and
then<00:04:17.140> I<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:18.340> pull<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.970> straight<00:04:19.390> out

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
then I just pull this straight out

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.790 
then I just pull this straight out
through<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.980> last<00:04:21.840> last<00:04:22.840> thing<00:04:23.140> like<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.350> in

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
through the last last thing like that in

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.530 
through the last last thing like that in
it<00:04:23.919> kind<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.520> blocks<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.180> little<00:04:25.419> bit

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
it kind of blocks it's a little bit

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.900 
it kind of blocks it's a little bit
loose<00:04:25.750> right<00:04:25.990> there<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:29.820> what's<00:04:30.820> called

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
loose right there so I use what's called

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.409 
loose right there so I use what's called
a<00:04:31.419> yarn<00:04:31.810> donor<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:33.730> know<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> little

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
a yarn donor you know I have a little

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.220 
a yarn donor you know I have a little
set<00:04:34.750> here<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.290> size<00:04:35.830> 14<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.430> 18<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.660> 14<00:04:38.200> is

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
set here that's size 14 to 18 so 14 is

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.430 
set here that's size 14 to 18 so 14 is
largest<00:04:38.740> one<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.220> that's<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:39.850> I'm<00:04:40.150> using

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
largest one and that's the one I'm using

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.560 
largest one and that's the one I'm using
and<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.710> fold<00:04:42.070> this<00:04:42.280> over<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.970> end<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.180> my<00:04:43.300> hook

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
and I fold this over the end of my hook

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.520 
and I fold this over the end of my hook
and<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.470> take<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.220> folded<00:04:45.760> side<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.380> push<00:04:47.380> it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
and I take the folded side and I push it

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.940 
and I take the folded side and I push it
through<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:48.340> needle<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:49.350> then<00:04:50.350> from<00:04:50.830> the

through the needle and then from the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.260 
through the needle and then from the
front<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.640> go<00:04:52.180> into<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.020> next<00:04:53.380> area<00:04:54.370> or<00:04:54.910> stitch

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
from the front to the back and then I

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.630 
from the front to the back and then I
turn<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.760> over<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.360> back<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.490> my

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
turn it over to the back and I so in my

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.700 
turn it over to the back and I so in my
end<00:05:03.880> here<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:06.240> want<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.300> catch<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.930> starting

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
end here I want to catch the starting

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.670 
end here I want to catch the starting
chain<00:05:08.919> end<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.460> then<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.750> went<00:05:11.290> out<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.440> little

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
chain end and then I I went out a little

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.460 
chain end and then I I went out a little
bit<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.100> then<00:05:12.280> I'm<00:05:12.370> coming<00:05:12.580> back<00:05:13.080> just<00:05:14.080> about

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
bit and then I'm coming back just about

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.170 
bit and then I'm coming back just about
an<00:05:14.590> eighth<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.890> an<00:05:15.010> inch<00:05:15.130> behind<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:15.940> and

an eighth of an inch behind that and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.670 
an eighth of an inch behind that and
then<00:05:16.450> I'm<00:05:16.570> going<00:05:16.750> back<00:05:16.990> out<00:05:17.200> again<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:19.680> then

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
that starting chain a little bit more

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.740 
that starting chain a little bit more
again<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.570> time<00:05:48.240> I'm<00:05:49.240> going<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.540> secure

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
again and this time I'm going to secure

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.939 
again and this time I'm going to secure
it<00:05:50.080> with<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.320> couple<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.800> stitches<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:53.680> one

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
it with a couple of stitches so this one

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.180 
it with a couple of stitches so this one
you<00:05:53.979> want<00:05:54.250> to<00:05:54.400> make<00:05:54.940> sure<00:05:54.970> it's<00:05:55.300> real<00:05:55.479> secure

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
you want to make sure it's real secure

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.740 
you want to make sure it's real secure
because<00:05:57.190> if<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.729> loosens<00:05:58.150> up<00:05:58.360> you're<00:05:58.600> going<00:05:58.690> to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
because if it loosens up you're going to

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.980 
because if it loosens up you're going to
have<00:05:58.810> that<00:05:59.020> whole<00:05:59.290> comeback<00:05:59.740> in<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.039> middle

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
have that whole comeback in the middle

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:09.320 
have that whole comeback in the middle
I'm<00:06:01.990> just<00:06:02.260> going<00:06:02.410> to<00:06:02.440> go<00:06:02.680> over<00:06:02.949> it

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.180

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
what's that I'm going to cut that cut

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.600 
what's that I'm going to cut that cut
the<00:06:18.120> small<00:06:18.930> blue<00:06:19.200> star<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:20.010> pattern<00:06:20.370> number

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
the small blue star the pattern number

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.710 
the small blue star the pattern number
four<00:06:20.790> this<00:06:20.880> is<00:06:21.090> FP<00:06:21.570> four<00:06:21.930> zero<00:06:22.260> four<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:23.720> I

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
four this is FP four zero four and I

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.900 
four this is FP four zero four and I
used<00:06:24.990> a<00:06:25.200> different<00:06:25.410> brand<00:06:25.890> of<00:06:26.100> yarn<00:06:26.370> for<00:06:26.490> this

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
used a different brand of yarn for this

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.290 
used a different brand of yarn for this
you<00:06:27.450> can<00:06:27.630> sometimes<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.290> same<00:06:28.560> brand

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
you can sometimes the same brand

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.580 
you can sometimes the same brand
different<00:06:30.300> colors<00:06:30.690> will<00:06:30.990> be<00:06:31.140> a<00:06:31.170> different

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
different colors will be a different

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.220 
different colors will be a different
gauge<00:06:31.800> believe<00:06:32.400> it<00:06:32.520> or<00:06:32.640> not<00:06:32.790> and<00:06:33.390> so<00:06:33.750> this<00:06:33.960> one

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
gauge believe it or not and so this one

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.880 
gauge believe it or not and so this one
is<00:06:34.730> just<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:35.940> little<00:06:36.180> speck<00:06:37.020> bigger<00:06:37.500> than<00:06:37.800> the

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
is just a little speck bigger than the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.300 
is just a little speck bigger than the
other<00:06:38.070> one

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
other one

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.880 
other one
so<00:06:41.310> that's<00:06:41.700> the<00:06:42.030> same<00:06:42.300> pattern<00:06:43.080> now<00:06:43.440> right

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
so that's the same pattern now right

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.550 
so that's the same pattern now right
there<00:06:44.130> so<00:06:45.090> I<00:06:45.480> hope<00:06:45.720> you<00:06:45.900> enjoyed<00:06:46.170> this<00:06:46.380> video
