00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.449
 ah 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 in this last time I am sowing you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 released in our diverse country 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 products belonging to the segment of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.800
 that it is the most popular category 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.810
 of the Argentine market today in news 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 on wheels let's try one of the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.250
 latest releases of the brand 's 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 golden bun I'm talking about the onix a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.100
 my body that has a 1.4 engine 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 98 horsepower associated with a 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.539
 5 - speed manual gearbox will not advance 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.020
 more and I propose that we know it well 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.020
 in detail 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.150
 the engine is the same 1.4 that the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.480
 agile but that has been improved and 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.880
 develops more power from 92 steps to 98 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.560
 horsepower we had doubts of 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.810
 this evolution but really the improvement 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.030
 is remarkable and this can be seen in 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.190
 super formal is warned in massereene 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.770
 not silent and with a very good 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.780
 response in high and low also we 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.820
 pleasantly surprised the selector of the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.430
 gearbox that is accurate and with 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.230
 short trips something that is not always 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.590
 happens in other models of the brand of 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.660
 golden bun the onyx offers a highlight 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.790
 ride comfort and excellent 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.530
 interior soundproofing 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.420
 if we talk about consumption we have to say 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.300
 that is quite austere about 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.610
 everything in the route in synthesis all this 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.619
 round a good car with an excellent 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
 cost-benefit equation and at the level 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.500
 aesthetic exhibits in attractive lines and 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.500
 modern 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.040
 the onyx comes to compete in the segment 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.380
 most populated of the Argentine market between 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.160
 its competitors is the fiat alioli 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.800
 I attached the function 207 compact on the c3 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.830
 the train goal 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.660
 and nissan marched many models but 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.180
 if we have to name the rivals 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.750
 direct these are two the use of the train and 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.750
 the fiat palio 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.210
 this onix just like the prism offers 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 an excellent price-product ratio 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.890
 but that's not all since this 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.320
 hatchback exhibits a modern design and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.990
 attractive great habitability good 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.360

 body slides inside is modern with 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.940
 sports from its upholstery that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.190
 it looks more youthful than in the prism 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.960
 the iron is characterized by the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.000

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.210
 multipoint electronic injection with a 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.810
 displacement of thousand 398 centimeters 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.110
 cubic the power 98 looks and the pair 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.050
 maximum torque 126 minutes meters at 2 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.230
 thousand 800 revolutions per minute the box 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.360
 It's five more manual 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.640
 regarding speed performance 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.950
 maximum at 180 kilometers per hour accelerates 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.250
 from 0 to 100 in 10 6 seconds the consumption 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.340
 urban 9.5 liters per 100 kilometers in 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.080
 route 5.5 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.300
 which gives a mixed consumption of about 8 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.130
 liters per 100 kilometers the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.650

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.520
 fuel tank 54 liters and the 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.520
 chest 280 cubic decimeters 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.310
 at this time we do the evaluation 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.100
 end of the onyx euro we go with the most 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.680
 and the least we start with the thumb 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.620
 upwards for the design as we said 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.540
 it is really modern also the 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.980
 habitability because we have to say 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.350
 that even the back doors are 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.600
 same as your brother let's say the prism 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.520
 what is a little bit penalty to do the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.040
 Loading capacity 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.410
 and the change electors really is 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.050
 very accurate web friends on tours 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.390
 short is a car that has a good 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.760
 dynamic balance too so it's 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.740
 a comfortable car and at the same time enough 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.830
 route squad is a balanced car 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.530
 very interesting as - very much I insist the 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.320
 trunk theme since I do not know we can not 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.210
 have to open only with the key 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.310
 would have to have a button to open the 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.080
 trunk because if you do not have to uncouple 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.860
 the motor observe the motor draw the 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.540
 key and up uls 5 is how it is very 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.130
 uncomfortable more for this type of cars 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.710
 for all types of cars it is uncomfortable but 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.070
 really more today for the button 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.070
 before 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.379
 and then the spare wheel that is 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.300
 temporary we also have to say it 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:21.169
 for those who undertake long 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.360
 trips in our country can also be 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.819
 circulate too much time that you have to 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.349
 change it soon that wheel because 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.909
 the dynamic balance of self the 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.189
 dynamic behavior of the car changes 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:37.479
 with that clear temporary wheel to go 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:37.479
 until a rubber shop and also jumps 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.870
 but it will not be very happy in this 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.389
 travel to the low step but good 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:53.169
 it really is a car with a relationship 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:55.550
 very very good price-product very 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:07:00.069
 interesting and good so ended the 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.069
 chevrolet driving test by ix
