hand<00:00:42.600> pressure<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.460> neon<00:00:47.820> sign

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
hand pressure this is the neon sign

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
hand pressure this is the neon sign
transformer<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:50.070> gives<00:00:50.280> me<00:00:50.489> nine

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

thousand volts DC give or take and this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.200 
thousand volts DC give or take and this
goes<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.480> volt<00:01:00.809> meter<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.280> goes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
goes to the volt meter and it also goes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
goes to the volt meter and it also goes
to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.010> capacitors<00:01:05.960> pastors<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.229> connected

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to the capacitors pastors are connected

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.850 
to the capacitors pastors are connected
to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> spark<00:01:08.400> gap<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.260> all<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to the spark gap and all I have to do is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
to the spark gap and all I have to do is
pull<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.159> string<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.049> triggers<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> spark

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
pull the string and triggers the spark

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.300 
pull the string and triggers the spark
gap<00:01:14.240> here<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:16.200> coil<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
gap here is the work coil and the can

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.789 
gap here is the work coil and the can
the<00:01:17.939> coil<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:19.340> 1.6<00:01:20.340> micro<00:01:20.700> Henry's<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
the coil is about 1.6 micro Henry's and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.300 
the coil is about 1.6 micro Henry's and
this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.720> diode<00:01:24.720> bank<00:01:25.189> hopefully<00:01:26.189> I'll

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this is a diode bank hopefully I'll

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
this is a diode bank hopefully I'll
catch<00:01:26.610> any<00:01:26.850> amf<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> coil<00:01:28.380> my

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
catch any amf from the coil my

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
catch any amf from the coil my
calculations<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.240> correct<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:31.079> will

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
calculations are correct this will

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.810 
calculations are correct this will
either<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.920> destroyed<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.700> explode<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
either be destroyed or and or explode so

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.640 
either be destroyed or and or explode so
let's<00:01:38.820> start<00:01:39.090> crushing<00:01:39.360> cans

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650
