00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.350 

so<00:00:11.230> I<00:00:11.259> decided<00:00:11.740> that<00:00:11.890> trying<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:12.880> move<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
so I decided that trying to move the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.930 
so I decided that trying to move the
actual<00:00:13.690> beehive<00:00:14.140> was<00:00:14.470> a<00:00:14.500> bad<00:00:14.740> idea

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
actual beehive was a bad idea

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.050 
actual beehive was a bad idea
but<00:00:16.599> I<00:00:17.199> came<00:00:17.680> up<00:00:17.859> with<00:00:18.099> an<00:00:18.220> alternate<00:00:18.609> plan<00:00:18.730> to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
but I came up with an alternate plan to

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.790 
but I came up with an alternate plan to
build<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.869> nuke<00:00:20.560> box<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:21.840> split<00:00:22.840> my<00:00:23.020> colony<00:00:23.529> and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
build a nuke box to split my colony and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.279 
build a nuke box to split my colony and
make<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.670> mini<00:00:24.910> colony<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.660> take<00:00:25.960> that<00:00:26.050> mini

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
make a mini colony and take that mini

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.550 
make a mini colony and take that mini
colony<00:00:26.680> with<00:00:26.830> me<00:00:26.980> right<00:00:27.100> so<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:29.260> went<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
colony with me right so we went to the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:40.280 
colony with me right so we went to the
hardware<00:00:29.740> store<00:00:35.520> yeah<00:00:36.520> dad<00:00:36.850> got<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.180> board

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.889 

and<00:00:41.290> we're<00:00:41.860> gonna<00:00:41.980> use<00:00:42.219> this<00:00:45.420> cut<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.510> up<00:00:46.660> and

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
and we're gonna use this cut it up and

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.069 
and we're gonna use this cut it up and
make<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.230> nuke<00:00:47.469> box<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:49.450> less<00:00:49.660> than<00:00:49.899> nine

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
make a nuke box for less than nine

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.110 
make a nuke box for less than nine
dollars<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.739> board<00:00:51.070> was<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:51.460> 850<00:00:52.000> or

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
dollars the board was like 850 or

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.750 
dollars the board was like 850 or
something<00:00:52.480> but<00:00:53.170> don't<00:00:53.950> forget<00:00:54.100> protective

hours and hours but Joel Salatin said
that<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:08.170> you're<00:01:08.289> getting<00:01:08.469> started<00:01:08.649> with

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
that when you're getting started with

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.099 
that when you're getting started with
like<00:01:09.359> farming<00:01:10.359> and<00:01:10.509> homesteading<00:01:11.049> and

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.109 
like farming and homesteading and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:12.690 
like farming and homesteading and
whatever<00:01:11.289> if<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.889> want<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.159> like<00:01:12.310> make<00:01:12.549> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
whatever if you want to like make it

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.029 
whatever if you want to like make it
economically<00:01:13.270> viable<00:01:13.569> one<00:01:14.439> thing<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.740> do<00:01:14.859> is

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
economically viable one thing to do is

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.779 
economically viable one thing to do is
choose<00:01:15.369> techniques<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.319> labor

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
choose techniques that are labor

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.580 
choose techniques that are labor
expensive<00:01:18.789> as<00:01:19.029> opposed<00:01:19.359> to<00:01:19.479> cash<00:01:20.020> extensions

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
expensive as opposed to cash extensions

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.249 
expensive as opposed to cash extensions
so<00:01:21.219> lucky<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:21.939> had<00:01:22.179> the<00:01:22.270> skill<00:01:22.509> sock<00:01:22.749> if<00:01:22.959> my<00:01:23.079> dad

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
so lucky I had the skill sock if my dad

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.149 
so lucky I had the skill sock if my dad
left<00:01:23.439> it<00:01:23.560> here<00:01:23.740> one<00:01:23.889> time<00:01:24.179> but<00:01:25.649> if<00:01:26.649> I<00:01:26.799> didn't<00:01:27.099> I

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
left it here one time but if I didn't I

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.609 
left it here one time but if I didn't I
could<00:01:27.310> have<00:01:27.399> cut<00:01:27.549> him<00:01:27.639> by<00:01:27.729> hand<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.959> I<00:01:29.380> had<00:01:29.560> to

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
could have cut him by hand and I had to

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.409 
could have cut him by hand and I had to
do<00:01:29.709> some<00:01:29.859> other<00:01:29.920> things<00:01:30.219> like<00:01:33.090> yeah<00:01:34.090> there's<00:01:34.359> a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:34.419 
do some other things like yeah there's a

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:37.080 
do some other things like yeah there's a
farm<00:01:34.689> oh<00:01:34.779> boy<00:01:34.929> if<00:01:35.859> I<00:01:36.310> had<00:01:36.579> some<00:01:36.789> different

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
farm oh boy if I had some different

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.800 
farm oh boy if I had some different
tools<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.359> might<00:01:37.539> have<00:01:37.630> done<00:01:37.719> it

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
tools that might have done it

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.589 
tools that might have done it
differently<00:01:38.109> but<00:01:38.380> okay<00:01:39.189> so<00:01:39.299> hours<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.479> effort

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
differently but okay so hours of effort

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.449 
differently but okay so hours of effort
later<00:01:40.959> got<00:01:41.200> us<00:01:41.319> this<00:01:41.529> stack<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.009> boards<00:01:42.249> right

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
later got us this stack of boards right

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.590 
later got us this stack of boards right
here<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
here and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.140 
here and
bottom<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.619> sides<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.549> ends<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
bottom two sides the top two ends and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.039 
bottom two sides the top two ends and
then<00:01:48.540> Scrappy's<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.650> be<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.720> into<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> top

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
then Scrappy's will be the into the top

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
then Scrappy's will be the into the top
and<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> hand<00:01:53.189> holds<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and these will be the hand holds on the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.980 
and these will be the hand holds on the
side<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.940> other<00:01:56.970> thing<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.540> shared<00:01:59.990> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
side and the other thing I shared this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.969 
side and the other thing I shared this
is<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.530> did<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.860> was

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is the other thing I did that was

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.710 
is the other thing I did that was
labor-intensive<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:02.940> opposed<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> machinery

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
labor-intensive as opposed to machinery

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.600 
labor-intensive as opposed to machinery
intensive<00:02:05.330> okay<00:02:06.360> chiseled<00:02:07.350> these<00:02:07.470> out<00:02:07.710> by

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
intensive okay chiseled these out by

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.720 
intensive okay chiseled these out by
hand<00:02:09.380> that's<00:02:10.380> where<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:13.400> frames<00:02:14.400> are<00:02:14.580> gonna

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
hand that's where the frames are gonna

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.660 
hand that's where the frames are gonna
rest<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.209> there<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.100> not<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:17.489> size

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
rest in there this is not the right size

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.780 
rest in there this is not the right size
famous<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> shallow<00:02:18.480> frame<00:02:18.840> suit<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.700> would

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
famous as a shallow frame suit it would

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.240 
famous as a shallow frame suit it would
be<00:02:20.910> longer<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.140> that's<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.560> shelf<00:02:23.010> for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
be longer but so that's the shelf for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.800 
be longer but so that's the shelf for
that<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:24.959> eyeballed<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:26.510> 5/8<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.690> an

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that and I just eyeballed that 5/8 of an

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.039 
that and I just eyeballed that 5/8 of an
inch<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.560> about<00:02:28.890> halfway<00:02:29.100> through<00:02:36.049> good

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
inch down and about halfway through good

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:48.350 
inch down and about halfway through good
now<00:02:37.200> finish<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> other<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:47.239> all<00:02:48.239> right

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
now finish up the other one all right

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.089 
now finish up the other one all right
here<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.780> our<00:02:48.930> finished

some<00:03:33.760> gaps<00:03:33.969> in<00:03:34.120> there<00:03:34.299> isn't<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.549> bad<00:03:36.549> thing<00:03:36.819> the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:36.969 
some gaps in there isn't a bad thing the

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.500 
some gaps in there isn't a bad thing the
bees<00:03:37.150> actually<00:03:37.389> go<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.079> they<00:03:38.230> fill<00:03:38.469> up<00:03:39.510> any

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
gaps or rough spots with the propolis

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.059 
gaps or rough spots with the propolis
you<00:03:46.150> can<00:03:46.329> see<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.629> this<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.139> just<00:03:47.379> raw

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
you can see on this this is just raw

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.530 
you can see on this this is just raw
wood<00:03:48.400> but<00:03:48.819> you<00:03:48.939> see<00:03:49.120> how<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.359> got<00:03:49.510> that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
wood but you see how it's got that

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.179 
wood but you see how it's got that
yellow<00:03:49.959> tint<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.439> it<00:03:50.469> that's<00:03:50.769> because<00:03:51.069> the

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
yellow tint to it that's because the

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.959 
yellow tint to it that's because the
bezel<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:51.909> is<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> piece<00:03:52.359> off<00:03:52.569> of<00:03:52.719> a<00:03:52.870> broken

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:53.969 
bezel this is a piece off of a broken

00:03:53.969 --> 00:04:01.499 
bezel this is a piece off of a broken
hive<00:03:56.250> top<00:03:57.250> bar<00:03:58.709> but<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:01.000> can<00:04:01.150> see<00:04:01.329> how<00:04:01.389> it

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:01.509 
hive top bar but you can see how it

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:02.429 
hive top bar but you can see how it
looks<00:04:01.659> yellow<00:04:01.810> because<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.139> bees<00:04:02.290> have

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
looks yellow because the bees have

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.780 
looks yellow because the bees have
coated<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.859> in<00:04:02.979> propolis<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.609> that's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
coated it in propolis and that's

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.050 
coated it in propolis and that's
actually<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.419> adds<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.810> good<00:04:04.959> thing<00:04:06.060> helps

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
actually this adds a good thing helps

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:19.500 
actually this adds a good thing helps
keep<00:04:07.239> disease<00:04:07.599> out<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.199> hive

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.970 

and<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:21.770> went<00:04:22.010> ahead<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:26.260> just<00:04:27.260> let<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.950> whole

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
and I went ahead and just let the whole

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.450 
and I went ahead and just let the whole
bottom<00:04:28.520> open<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.770> reason<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.100> did<00:04:31.310> that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
bottom open and the reason I did that

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
bottom open and the reason I did that
actually<00:04:31.820> let<00:04:32.090> me<00:04:32.150> take<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.390> jump<00:04:32.570> off<00:04:34.480> reason

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
actually let me take the jump off reason

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.250 
actually let me take the jump off reason
I<00:04:35.540> did<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:35.900> because<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.740> nucleus<00:04:37.160> hive

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
I did that is because the nucleus hive

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.450 
I did that is because the nucleus hive
is<00:04:39.260> gonna<00:04:39.410> be<00:04:39.560> such<00:04:39.740> small<00:04:39.980> numbers<00:04:40.040> that

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
is gonna be such small numbers that

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.650 
is gonna be such small numbers that
they're<00:04:40.610> gonna<00:04:40.730> need<00:04:40.880> help<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.300> whole<00:04:41.420> time

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
they're gonna need help the whole time

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:53.050 
they're gonna need help the whole time
so<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.550> hi<00:04:51.220> Peter<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.880> then

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
so so this is a hi Peter and so then

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.060 
so so this is a hi Peter and so then

inches<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.490> clearance<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:55.970> come<00:04:56.120> on<00:04:56.240> out<00:04:56.420> but

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
inches of clearance to come on out but

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.880 
inches of clearance to come on out but
then<00:04:56.780> here's<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.170> high<00:04:57.320> for<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.040> little<00:04:58.190> fender

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890

then here's the high for a little fender
seafood<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.490> climb<00:05:01.760> in<00:05:01.970> there<00:05:02.440> you<00:05:03.440> have

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
seafood and they climb in there you have

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.950 
seafood and they climb in there you have
the<00:05:03.710> jar<00:05:03.920> upside<00:05:04.070> down<00:05:04.340> right<00:05:04.490> here<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:05.780> we'll

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
the jar upside down right here so we'll

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.450 
the jar upside down right here so we'll
have<00:05:06.140> that<00:05:06.350> on<00:05:06.500> them<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.860> whole<00:05:06.890> time<00:05:07.220> that

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
have that on them the whole time that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.480 
have that on them the whole time that
they're<00:05:07.670> in<00:05:07.820> there<00:05:08.950> until<00:05:09.950> we<00:05:10.040> get<00:05:10.160> them<00:05:10.280> moved

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
they're in there until we get them moved

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:24.130 
they're in there until we get them moved
over<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:11.000> their<00:05:11.780> permanent<00:05:12.020> hive

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.150
