00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.550
 I am standing with a supposedly great Dutch talent but not someone 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.139
 which appears a lot in the media in the van not in the Netherlands 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.869
 so it is nice to have a picture just once to have thyssen every little thing 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.789
 with turned on the layman are becoming 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.419
 for Zeeland scez audience more than 8 percent what for themselves katie price it the tent 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.140
 the weather was not good today but it got better and better than expected 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.829
 by 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.390
 and then that syria response from those people was that without turned out not so great there 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:33.449
 from that it will succeed for the certainty that it was genuinely super 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.170
 and your neck hair will stand upright as a child on super besse free 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 stable 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.150
 no not immediately that I think a lot of people but still in dialect 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.070
 I try to break through a little you know which direction 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.110
 years of tech house in that place of a lot of british shows you don't think so 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 so much on March 6 with a lot of people who quit but the box progressive 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 and an office press on a goat you know most my sounds surely melodic and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.150
 a bit of today's production, I think 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.590
 yes absolutely yes i was pleasantly surprised that i say and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 but it is a very interesting thing now it would be hard to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.870
 solid ground at the foot you get the netherlands yes this is it is for me too 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.170
 has the first year that I in the Netherlands to some festivals 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.790
 have been penetrating the empire abroad for some time 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.600
 And the adjusted profit was last year when it was all about dreams that I ever had 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.530
 I did some more interest from the Netherlands and as a task 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.920
 also some festivals this year and yes that was great of course to see that 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.650
 it adorns them absolutely hard to make as dutch artists and set foot on the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.570
 get land in the Netherlands 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.280
 well that is of course that i stuff you are affiliated with that when 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.950
 offender knows the general public You sometimes get caught up in that box, yes 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 absolutely and also think about the line is also still you know that yes knew 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.730
 we try 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.100
 and that the main leo from of the last self years along with running sands and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.350
 yes they are also trying to do very broadly at the moment 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.939
 but yes you still quickly in that box prodesse part counsel yes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 the time that the time is not only beautiful and you have to try to break into it yourself 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.860
 I think 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 and I really like you and that term that you hear is open so there is you 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.069
 Lightrec are very well cared for and are also in mixes 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.409
 very smoothly further, it is just trying to put a lot of effort into it 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.109
 Being a producer is also real to me 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.139
 He is running in the weekend and in the rest of the five days a week 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.189
 week in the studio 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.679
 and the dish spends a lot of care on the deck 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.609
 quality would also be the sound quality of the tracks that he was wrong one 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.459
 important 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.429
 and yes that is I am yourself you know I am 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:28.669
 raju i am a regular purist and everything should go well say if it is one 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.309
 small mistake super earthy than annoying 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.889
 and the sound comes too good I think but you often enough 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.570
 probably also that does not sound good and then you stand real biting 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.390
 yes this was she was a member of the super led this trend was clear there was 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.219
 was very good 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.869
 and we have regular stadjer yes that would have led between what is or is 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.140
 i can't tune up well 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.850
 or just spyker yes then you must 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.389
 how to race a little look ahead for most people 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.019
 It doesn't really matter that much but as a DJ you notice that 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.870
 if the sound is better elsewhere there people are also more in the music say 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.799
 wet but it all goes a bit looser or not 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.659
 Yeah so 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.780
 five days a week you are actually producing but in 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.080
 it ad own labels or yes I have my own label the south side boxmeer 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.889
 I started with that in 2006 and there is a worker 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.049
 14 the release I think the eyes are negotiated again month to month in 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:20.659
 lyts 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.239
 He will register a digital that you just have with the market nowadays thys 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.639
 very bad for the new one with us anyway 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.039
 were going every year is going in the right direction and I am also going through more and more 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.299
 own texts and that is why label tries to give an amd more 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:34.720
 perhaps 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.570
 I have the same image, but indeed, and yes and I do too 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.549
 just go to 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.489
 say new talent but also the lion if it doesn't matter if we are on well 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.099
 someone has been busy for a long time, isn't it 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.069
 yes as long as the music is good and well cared for with the digital me here 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.019
 and there risk takers because you immediately have to squeeze a thousand cars 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.369
 shalit look i'd rather not have it if i'm not completely sure 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.319
 then be over 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.769
 then i also don't explain because it is running it there is so much music currently 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.210
 so much is released that 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.960
 you just have to come up with a new one a little later to come out 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.189
 therefore, to tell yourself to distinguish from it, say 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.459
 marijke cup I try as many Thursday as possible good things 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.379
 and hope that it will be picked up properly 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.900
 and a rosÃ©tje plans for the coming months for the weather to life 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.690
 much anyway but i always have 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.270
 the kingdom that writes in after group but she will along with 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.530
 the bear bystander with with I watched 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.460
 and some more people and on the second extra couple and test the canvas on which 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 warm up always the first one and a half and two hours driver 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.639
 Only I have some foreign things again when they understand Russia 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.819
 and in September often a tour to South America often make 2 Nov a record 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:45.539
 wolves 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.490
 furthermore I also look at my speed both loans have been in mexico so far 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.770
 and that was too crazy so after that argentina and brazil want to go 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.069
 do yes that must be really super ordering that is 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.960
 and today linger around funny people see the croo that I go through then 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.469
