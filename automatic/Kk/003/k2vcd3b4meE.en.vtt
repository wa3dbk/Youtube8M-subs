your hand well this is the PI post try

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190 
your hand well this is the PI post try
and<00:00:38.070> make<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.310> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.489> shinier<00:00:39.200> anyways

and make it a little shinier anyways
it's<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:40.530> exhaust<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> MRP<00:00:41.340> exhaust

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's our exhaust is the MRP exhaust

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's our exhaust is the MRP exhaust
right<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.450> give<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.870> top-end

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
right this should give you more top-end

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.780 
right this should give you more top-end
speed<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.250> looking<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.610> less

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
speed so we're looking at less

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.400 
speed so we're looking at less
restriction<00:00:45.330> there<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.690> yeah<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.290> see

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
restriction there right yeah you can see

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.660 
restriction there right yeah you can see
we've<00:00:46.530> already<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.920> baffle<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.400> of<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we've already got the baffle out of it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.130 
we've already got the baffle out of it
and<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.030> sure<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> sounds<00:00:48.570> better<00:00:48.690> too

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and I'm sure it sounds better too

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.780 
and I'm sure it sounds better too
it<00:00:49.200> sounds<00:00:49.800> great<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.550> course<00:00:50.610> we

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the cart now if you also have a few

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.950 
the cart now if you also have a few
electronics<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.610> us<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.970> is<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.540> super

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
electronics here for us this is a super

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
electronics here for us this is a super
coil<00:01:01.170> okay<00:01:01.680> gives<00:01:02.159> you<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.339> little<00:01:02.580> bit<00:01:02.670> more

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
coil okay gives you a little bit more

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
coil okay gives you a little bit more
power<00:01:03.150> than<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> regular<00:01:03.930> coil<00:01:04.140> okay<00:01:04.500> great

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
power than the regular coil okay great

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
power than the regular coil okay great
and<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.510> replacing<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.020> should<00:01:07.260> give<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and just replacing this should give it a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
and just replacing this should give it a
little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:07.950> power<00:01:08.159> alright<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.760> then

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
little bit more power alright and then

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
little bit more power alright and then
we<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.270> trick<00:01:09.510> looking<00:01:09.750> air

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
we have a pretty trick looking air

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.360 
we have a pretty trick looking air
filter<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> air<00:01:10.950> filter<00:01:11.220> yes

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
filter here that's the air filter yes

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.040 
filter here that's the air filter yes
okay<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> will<00:01:12.240> give<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.450> some<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.720> cold

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
okay so this will give it some more cold

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.170 
okay so this will give it some more cold
fresh<00:01:13.350> air<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> upgraded<00:01:14.670> car<00:01:14.820> 30

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fresh air for the upgraded car 30
