the dk1 gopher trap from your provider
and<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.779> certainly<00:00:27.990> hope<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.470> would<00:00:28.560> consider

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and we certainly hope you would consider

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.030 
and we certainly hope you would consider
the<00:00:29.130> roadman<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> provider<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.769> comes

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the roadman for the provider it comes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
the roadman for the provider it comes
with<00:00:32.219> instructions<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:33.270> shows<00:00:33.480> how<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> set

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
with instructions that shows how to set

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
with instructions that shows how to set
the<00:00:34.170> trap<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.010> also<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> place<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.969> trap

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the trap and also how to place the trap

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.619 
the trap and also how to place the trap
in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> gopher<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.290> mole<00:00:37.950> tunnel<00:00:38.370> however<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
in the gopher or mole tunnel however it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.619 
in the gopher or mole tunnel however it
is<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.200> tricky<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.059> say<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
is a little bit tricky and as I say a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
is a little bit tricky and as I say a
picture's<00:00:43.170> worth<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.559> thousand<00:00:44.040> words<00:00:44.309> when

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
picture's worth a thousand words when

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.000 
picture's worth a thousand words when
you<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.719> trap<00:00:46.280> generally<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.820> spring

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
you get your trap generally the spring

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
you get your trap generally the spring
which<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> latch<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.239> latched<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
which has a latch on it is latched on to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880 
which has a latch on it is latched on to
the<00:00:52.649> handle<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:55.140> step<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the handle so that first step is to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
the handle so that first step is to
unlatch<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.550> take<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> when

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
unlatch it but take a look at that when

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
unlatch it but take a look at that when
you<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> set<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> trap

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you do it because when you set the trap

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
you do it because when you set the trap
you're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> relax<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you're going to have to relax that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.160 
you're going to have to relax that
spring<00:01:01.649> back<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.399> okay<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:04.019> you'll

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
spring back on there okay then you'll

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
spring back on there okay then you'll
notice<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:04.979> both<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.720> solid<00:01:06.720> jaw

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
notice that there's both a solid jaw

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
notice that there's both a solid jaw
right<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.220> connected<00:01:08.760> through<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
right here it's connected through the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
right here it's connected through the
spring<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> handle<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.439> set<00:01:10.710> jaw<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
spring to the handle or set jaw and a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
spring to the handle or set jaw and a
movable<00:01:12.390> jaw<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> can't<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.890> can't<00:01:14.130> move

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
movable jaw but you can't you can't move

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.380 
movable jaw but you can't you can't move
either<00:01:14.570> by<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.409> jaw<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:17.090> also<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.360> be

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
either by the jaw or also it can be

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
either by the jaw or also it can be
moved<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.310> spring<00:01:20.880> latch<00:01:21.950> also<00:01:22.950> there

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
moved from the spring latch also there

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.990 
moved from the spring latch also there
is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.780> flat<00:01:24.780> pant<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> bottom<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
is a flat pant and at the bottom of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.810 
is a flat pant and at the bottom of the
flat<00:01:27.210> pan<00:01:27.600> there's<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> hole<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.950> when

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
flat pan there's a hole there and when

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
flat pan there's a hole there and when
we<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> setting<00:01:30.659> process<00:01:31.110> we're<00:01:31.320> going

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we go in the setting process we're going

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
we go in the setting process we're going
to<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> stick<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.280> tail<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.390> wire

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to have to stick the tail of this wire

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.940 
to have to stick the tail of this wire
in<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.049> hole<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> trigger<00:01:36.600> wire

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
in that hole this is the trigger wire

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
in that hole this is the trigger wire
it's<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.729> important<00:01:39.180> part<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.930> thing

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's a very important part and one thing

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's a very important part and one thing
I<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> point<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I want to point out to this is on this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.810 
I want to point out to this is on this
trigger<00:01:42.090> wire<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.770> hook<00:01:44.549> on

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
trigger wire there is a little hook on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.859 
trigger wire there is a little hook on
that<00:01:45.420> wire<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.979> hook<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.970> latch<00:01:48.360> needs

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that wire and that hook or latch needs

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.639 
that wire and that hook or latch needs
to<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> top<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:51.090> fixed<00:01:51.420> jaw<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to go on the top of the fixed jaw in the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.700 
to go on the top of the fixed jaw in the
tail<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.420> wire<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> bottom<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
tail of the wire go on the bottom of it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.580 
tail of the wire go on the bottom of it
and<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.630> tricky<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> slip<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and it's it's a little tricky to slip in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
and it's it's a little tricky to slip in
there<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.149> fundamental<00:02:00.420> part

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
there but it's a very fundamental part

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.590 
there but it's a very fundamental part
of<00:02:01.079> setting<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> trap<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.610> we're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
of setting the trap so here we go we're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980 
of setting the trap so here we go we're
going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> set<00:02:04.020> slide<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.040> hook<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.490> top<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
going to set slide that hook on top and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
going to set slide that hook on top and
the<00:02:07.290> wire<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> bottom<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.910> push

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the wire on the bottom and then we push

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.699 
the wire on the bottom and then we push
the<00:02:09.360> tail<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> wire<00:02:10.099> into<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.129> spring

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the tail on the wire into the spring

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.259 
the tail on the wire into the spring
and<00:02:12.829> to<00:02:13.189> the<00:02:13.280> top<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.879> spring<00:02:14.650> okay<00:02:16.269> there

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and to the top of the spring okay there

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.050 
and to the top of the spring okay there
we<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.110> closer<00:02:18.379> look<00:02:18.620> at<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.489> goes

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
we go have a closer look at that it goes

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.970 
we go have a closer look at that it goes
about<00:02:20.299> a<00:02:20.360> half<00:02:20.629> way<00:02:20.870> over<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.379> wire<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:23.980> we

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
about a half way over that wire and we

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.679 
about a half way over that wire and we
push<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> tail<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.849> on<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> spring<00:02:26.450> and

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
push the tail of it on the spring and

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.920 
push the tail of it on the spring and
then<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.019> take<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.379> flat<00:02:27.650> pan<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.879> we<00:02:29.629> slide

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
then we take the flat pan and we slide

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.970 
then we take the flat pan and we slide
that<00:02:30.230> over<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.459> wire<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.439> I<00:02:33.439> like<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.829> have

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that over that wire and I like to have

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.830 
that over that wire and I like to have
the<00:02:34.129> wire<00:02:34.340> sticking<00:02:34.819> through<00:02:34.970> there<00:02:35.209> 1/2<00:02:35.599> inch

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the wire sticking through there 1/2 inch

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.649 
the wire sticking through there 1/2 inch
or<00:02:35.989> 3/4<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.709> inch<00:02:36.859> and<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.239> safety

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
or 3/4 an inch and this is for safety

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.099 
or 3/4 an inch and this is for safety
reasons<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:39.109> that<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> trap<00:02:41.299> does<00:02:41.510> not<00:02:41.689> go<00:02:41.900> off

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
reasons so that the trap does not go off

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.660 
reasons so that the trap does not go off
when<00:02:42.409> you're<00:02:42.530> setting<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
when you're setting it because if it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.199 
when you're setting it because if it
does<00:02:43.909> you'll<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.459> trap<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
does you'll do it now the trap is in the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.119 
does you'll do it now the trap is in the
Scent<00:02:47.450> position<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.590> rotated

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
Scent position this is can be rotated

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.180 
Scent position this is can be rotated
but<00:02:52.459> when<00:02:52.670> it's<00:02:52.819> set<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.680> want<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.069> be

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
but when it's set you want it to be

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.420 
but when it's set you want it to be
between<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.670> jaws<00:02:56.530> however<00:02:57.530> even<00:02:58.340> though

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
between the jaws however even though

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.940 
between the jaws however even though
it's<00:02:58.549> in<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> set<00:02:59.000> position<00:02:59.180> there's<00:02:59.689> no

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it's in the set position there's no

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.920 
it's in the set position there's no
tension<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.400> spring<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.569> that's<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
tension on the spring and that's the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.300 
tension on the spring and that's the
next<00:03:03.079> thing<00:03:03.260> we're<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.859> do<00:03:04.010> we're<00:03:04.280> going

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
next thing we're going to do we're going

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.250 
next thing we're going to do we're going
to<00:03:04.430> take<00:03:04.639> our<00:03:04.879> pointing<00:03:05.720> finger<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.230> our

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
to take our pointing finger and our

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.800 
to take our pointing finger and our
thumb<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.799> then<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:07.970> turn<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.269> handle

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
thumb and then we turn the handle

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.520 
thumb and then we turn the handle
clockwise<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:10.060> rehook<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.329> latch<00:03:11.659> onto<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
clockwise and rehook that latch onto the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.490 
clockwise and rehook that latch onto the
handle<00:03:12.920> like<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.250> was<00:03:13.459> when<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.150> got<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.540> okay

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
handle like it was when you got it okay

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.449 
handle like it was when you got it okay
thumb<00:03:16.129> forefinger<00:03:17.500> rotate<00:03:18.500> one<00:03:19.160> time

thumb forefinger rotate one time
clockwise<00:03:21.069> look<00:03:22.069> at<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.280> latch<00:03:23.109> now<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.169> trap

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
clockwise look at the latch now the trap

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.649 
clockwise look at the latch now the trap
is<00:03:24.799> totally<00:03:25.549> set<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.879> pan<00:03:28.879> is<00:03:29.120> not<00:03:29.239> in<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.480> very

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
is totally set the pan is not in a very

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.770 
is totally set the pan is not in a very
sensitive<00:03:30.109> position<00:03:30.739> because<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.310> wires

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
sensitive position because the wires

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.659 
sensitive position because the wires
stuck<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.989> their<00:03:33.169> half-inch<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:34.400> from<00:03:34.549> this

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
stuck to their half-inch but from this

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.879 
stuck to their half-inch but from this
point<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.109> not<00:03:36.169> want<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.620> put<00:03:36.769> our

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
point on we do not want to put our

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.170 
point on we do not want to put our
fingers<00:03:37.370> between<00:03:38.269> these<00:03:38.510> two<00:03:38.750> jaws<00:03:40.180> we're

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
fingers between these two jaws we're

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.819 
fingers between these two jaws we're
going<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.479> want<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.690> set<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.109> pan<00:03:42.409> so<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.799> a

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
going to want to set the pan so it's a

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.250 
going to want to set the pan so it's a
little<00:03:42.949> more<00:03:43.099> sensitive<00:03:43.669> it<00:03:44.359> really<00:03:44.900> won't<00:03:45.079> go

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
little more sensitive it really won't go

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.719 
little more sensitive it really won't go
off<00:03:45.440> when<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.919> half<00:03:46.099> inch<00:03:46.310> from<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.609> end

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
off when it's a half inch from the end

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.219 
off when it's a half inch from the end
so<00:03:47.690> we<00:03:48.079> need<00:03:48.229> to<00:03:48.409> slide<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.739> pan<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
so we need to slide the pan so that the

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.099 
so we need to slide the pan so that the
spring<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.859> just<00:03:52.340> barely<00:03:53.030> sticking<00:03:53.629> or<00:03:53.959> the

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
spring is just barely sticking or the

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.020 
spring is just barely sticking or the
wire<00:03:54.349> is<00:03:54.739> barely<00:03:55.040> sticking<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.609> that<00:03:55.790> hole

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
wire is barely sticking to that hole

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.960 
wire is barely sticking to that hole
1/16<00:03:56.840> an<00:03:56.989> inch<00:03:57.169> or<00:03:57.290> less<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.459> rubs<00:03:58.669> on<00:03:58.879> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
1/16 an inch or less and it rubs on the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.000 
1/16 an inch or less and it rubs on the
bottom<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.419> that<00:03:59.449> spring<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.440> kind<00:04:00.949> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
bottom and that spring so it kind of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.689 
bottom and that spring so it kind of
goes<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:02.690> click<00:04:02.989> at<00:04:03.139> a<00:04:03.199> time<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.190> notice<00:04:04.549> why

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
goes one click at a time and notice why

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.719 
goes one click at a time and notice why
I'm<00:04:04.819> doing<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.540> my<00:04:06.129> hand<00:04:07.129> or<00:04:07.370> fingers

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:07.729 
I'm doing this that my hand or fingers

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:13.210 
I'm doing this that my hand or fingers
is<00:04:07.970> not<00:04:08.299> between<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.780> jaws<00:04:09.940> okay<00:04:11.799> one<00:04:12.799> click

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
is not between the jaws okay one click
