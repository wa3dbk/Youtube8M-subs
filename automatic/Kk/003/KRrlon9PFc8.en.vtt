00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.309
 in this opportunity 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 staff a periodic decimal number 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.470
 the first one remember how many is 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.820
 newspaper after this number 6 35 35 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 35 we see that it repeats 35 is what 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.650
 we call the period you want to have in 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.110
 Note that the period is not the number 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.110
 that is repeated but the number of figures 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.170
 2 in this case the period would be 2 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.120
 okay 6.35 would be your representation as 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.630
 to which it is repeated we are going to place it 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.000
 a resistance very well now they ask him 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.780
 turns this periodic number into a 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.270
 rational as it is going to build 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.270
 a rational number ready then 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 study the hairline first is the number 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 whole 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.950
 in this case 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.080
 and I will always subtract the number that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.720
 have before the period in this case with 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 that number that is before the period the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.530
 6 ready then you will subtract 535 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.440
 elementary 6 the the denominator 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.649
 let's place 90 depending on which 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.100
 let's place as many nines as 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:42.820
 period have less than the number 23 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.490
 placed two nines would be missing the zeros 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.039
 how many zeros with eyes how much 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.560
 figures after the shots and 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.710
 some youthful exterior this number 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.100
 I do not have figures in that position in that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 site 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.140
 now we operate from recuperator 235 less 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 629 in the so-called would be 90 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 now they tell me 5,120 55 25 is still 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.900
 repeating here who is 25 as 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.840
 would represent this number that is written 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 everything until it repeats in 5.1 and 25 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.520
 that what he repeats we will write 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.380
 with a hat by a hairline indicating 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.890
 that repeats 25 25 25 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 now how does national first 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.790
 I write the whole number which is the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.980
 integer 5.125 and I'm going to subtract the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.720
 number that is before in the period which 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.550
 would be in this case the 51 very well in the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.940
 denominator that there will be first the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.680
 nine how many 9 I expose as a period 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.080
 have two figures 29 how many zeros I put 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.300
 as you always miss after the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.300
 way and before outside as we can 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.620
 see 50 shades there is a before you place a 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.090
 single 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.000
 in the numerator by subtracting 5100 35 with 51 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.720
 I get 5.074 and in the denominator I 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.220
 there are 990 left this would be the representation 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.000
 reacted last comes this number 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.489
 20 21 11 11 what is repeated here is the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.319
 1 describes the number to which it reaches 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.030
 the period in 2012 and then I write what 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.010
 that is repeated with the moment I am 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.549
 lowering the one that repeats is the gold and you 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.290
 place a hairline on top indicating that 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.239
 it is the only number that is repeated now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.060
 let's turn the already flood into 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.019
 I write the number as if it were a 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.730
 whole number 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.489
 then in this case it would be 2000 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.500
 and I'm going to subtract the number that is before 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.250
 in the period we have that numbers before 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.980
 of the period would be 202 of the rest 102 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.940
 in the denominator that I should see from 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:14.379
 how many nines as a period have a single 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.600
 9% lower South and how many zeros as 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.299
 always leave after 0 and before the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.729
 period how many plantings there are 23 placed 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.560
 two zeros when operating in numerator 2021 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.560
 202 I get 1819
