00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 she notes to the world is the scammed to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 people is offering us a new video for 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.859
 the first can be from my guide that I 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 are going to do on country of the two so that is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.620
 what did not help the two so it's a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.360
 co op strategy game or make some 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 robberies of jewelry banks fpt 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 full of mission phone between friends to you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 to burst in the evening until 5 o'clock 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.369
 matte as often as I have 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.560
 started a little guide so in this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 little kit I will start with your 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 inventory and the skills of that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 you can put and after I you 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 will make an instrument a guide with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.110
 buddies on parts how to handle well 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 its game and everything and everything at all 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.440
 I started for the inventory you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.690
 propose some souls that are not bad 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 for the beginning and how to choose his 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.770
 skill his coach and start with 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 assault rifles so for rifles 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.590
 Assault simply if you want 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.789
 to buy you make new weapons 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 and there you have weapons that you 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 can buy 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.530
 I feel I do not have much you can not 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.770
 not buy me gaudin so your 3 against 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.219
 the rams in the room so has finally if you 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 have the choice between these three years 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.799
 personally me who is a big fan 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.869
 da kg took the cam for the case it takes 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.610
 to know a good thing is that you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.640
 have the recoil complaint so if you 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 can read your elbow with the mouse or 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 with the handle I recommend the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.770
 afterwards if you do not have so much to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.890
 manage your recoil I advise you 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.000
 there because four for a lot of people 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.390
 told me the good of this weapon 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.950
 frankly it's a good weapon 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.320
 frankly she looks pretty good if you 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.850
 will not handle the recoil if you have 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.289
 managed look and I recommend 100% 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.119
 size that you will not need to 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.590
 this because four yes otherwise you can 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.670
 simply use the m16 too 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.049
 that a good soul 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.459
 so after I have been present 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.520
 secondary so the first two in 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.289
 secondary that's the end so here is so 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.939
 you have the choice between normally 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.250
 you 're going for lack of a treatment these 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.470
 three there is the first after 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.720
 it wanted to unlock the first 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.119
 wins it's fine then if it's putting 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.950
 the cros which is the mac the mac dispenses 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.209
 confident forge but I advise you to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.369
 cross it because frankly the 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.470
 crostis and weapons it's a medium 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.149
 favorite is my case the prefect with the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.170
 desert if they want me to think he 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.470
 will not be bad I have not yet 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.209
 unlocked and the python c that's not bad 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 but I do not use that much 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.790
 crossfit this witness was speaking very 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.019
 silent especially me who have phantom 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.700
 after that it's the skills I'm going 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.780
 explain to you afterwards but cros that the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.360
 six dancers frankly I tell you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.280
 100% advise to start so after 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.930
 you have the armor so the three 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.220
 armor so basic so that I you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.959
 advise if the time you have not 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.069
 to mention her to take this is because 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.350
 that it is there that it is sure that I use 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.850
 but that bulletproof vest on a suit 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.739
 so saw that phantom so for me to do me 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.170
 detect but after I'm concerned 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.730
 advise you especially his lassitude did 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.040
 still not unlocked it's the pressure 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.230
 this is the one that is unblocked with a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.120
 competence will be seen after after 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 equipment there is that it is according to what 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.319
 you take so here after there are some 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.329
 Basques and ben you bouquets them 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.530
 masks but that was wrong what we 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 have competing blocks the cards to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.130
 the end of the parts that will surely 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.549
 an episode of my kit when I do 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.870
 a party so finally follow for you 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.760
 to live something is how 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.010
 personal sound masks your strength and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.630
 your kivu mask the team and you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.750
 double click and you see it's a 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.669
 massive material but I do not have one 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.500
 color and then here is where you have 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.450
 customize your mask but I will 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.069
 not to advance your skills so 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.150
 I think for myself one of the most 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.400
 important of which you have the choice between 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.829
 brain executor technicians and phantom 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 dacquois start with brain so the 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.130
 brain is the guy who will handle everything 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.200
 which is hostage 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.520
 why so what you unlock from 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.560
 special is that you have the kit 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.780
 care that I use that's why 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.040
 that I have a point in after you have 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.370
 things that are not bad because 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.260
 you can for example land 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.740
 to be revived if you touch an enemy 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.320
 with a gun you have a charge 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.360
 you can receive another charge to 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.570
 your release 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.240
 and after improved you get three 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.100
 chargers instead of one so frankly 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.080
 it's good skills after that 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.820
 you can do is intimidate yourself 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.220
 civilians civilians remain intimidated 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.110
 longer end too you have 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.700
 revive the teammates quickly 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.620
 frankly that's very useful 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.270
 after you have reduce the cost of your 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.160
 shopping that's not bad though for 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.880
 vincent deputy mayor more the cost 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.090
 of your purchases 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.260
 yeah you have to reload the guns 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.400
 more quickly this roughly in 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.970
 all the skills you had 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.130
 something like that 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.450
 after there is increased speed 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.250
 reloading there was something that I 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.140
 knew it was not bad and civil 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.350
 loved ones can revive you into a tea 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.840
 at 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.420
 this is frankly that's not bad 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.040
 at all so apparently evora laundry 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.540
 nîmes then give you ammo that 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.730
 frankly it's not a bad 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.550
 skill after you have you can 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.190
 now move with frankly that 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.570
 can really be a good thing our ma 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.930
 no one I start the fatwa but after 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.300
 I will do brain so phantom it's not 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.490
 your brain it can be the cmec that puts 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.900
 ashore first people after you 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.270
 have executors who is the big village has 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.840
 so executor you have a lot of stuff 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.640
 interesting 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.920
 so I have more skills than a 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.820
 executor is for accor you take 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.680
 the sands you go faster 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.120
 frankly that's very important and 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.620
 I can change weapons designed the earth 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.450
 so the stuff not bad in the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.330
 executors who before take the 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.220
 last three so there you receive 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.550
 a limited damage bonus after having 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.380
 killed an anemia with shotgun is going 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.760
 so very good if you have the technique 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.400
 iron man who allows you to 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.260
 unlock the last armor you have 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.760
 there so so that lets you break the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.270
 clichés to be done about 20 miles 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.620
 what are you going to see? 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.210
 it's the guy who stuffs him by 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.220
 excellence your caprisa technicians 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.600
 so the technician is like his name 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.800
 the indicated is the one who will fart the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.260
 causes more easily as long as you 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.870
 can have turrets so they are 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.070
 small suitcases and you have a 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.680
 turrets inside frankly 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.090
 it's quite useful the ability of everything 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.710
 your men be raised sorry for 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.000
 background noise 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.480
 improve your armor by absorbing the 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.670
 turret damage increase bets 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.990
 you have the c4 too to fart so that 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.940
 frankly that's fine and there you have 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.130
 ghost so the stealthy guy by 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.870
 excellence so does at least that 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.830
 I took you because séverin 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.760
 thinking it's the guy who takes 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.740
 money since you have a 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.730
 skill to raise money a 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.920
 to run faster 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.320
 me falling guys and so something 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.690
 which is good is that you can 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.790
 start to you are less suspicious you 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.930
 we can take bodies in bags 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.160
 because every time we kill 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.570
 someone must answer bipper and 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.830
 take his body in a bag otherwise 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.010
 do detect what I have small 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.210
 bugs are not you can increase your 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.800
 chances to body-to-body reload more 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.930
 quickly more dd audience that's it 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.490
 not bad after you left me who 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.610
 lets shine camera message I 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:34.020
 not too much not try too much you can 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.240
 run and straffe and me that I did not know 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.790
 not that we could reduce the decline in 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.410
 arms with a silent finally you short 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.050
 can do a lot of things so 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.550
 it was all for this little tutorial I hope 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.000
 you'll like it in a little tutorial
