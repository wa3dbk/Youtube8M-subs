blue and purple because if you have a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
blue and purple because if you have a
look<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.430> hydrangeas<00:00:27.090> they're<00:00:27.270> essentially

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
look at hydrangeas they're essentially

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
look at hydrangeas they're essentially
three<00:00:28.020> different<00:00:28.320> colors<00:00:28.680> you're<00:00:29.520> going<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
three different colors you're going to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.410 
three different colors you're going to
fill<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.420> piping<00:00:31.289> bag<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.129> blue<00:00:32.420> now

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fill the piping bag with the blue now

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
fill the piping bag with the blue now
don't<00:00:33.870> fill<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> completely<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.250> we're<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
don't fill it completely and we're just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.190 
don't fill it completely and we're just
going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.850> fill<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.149> sort<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> little

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going to fill it sort of just a little

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.620 
going to fill it sort of just a little
bit<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.770> squish<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.310> down<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
bit and squish it down because what you

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.750 
bit and squish it down because what you
want<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.989> blue<00:00:40.380> on<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> outside<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.399> white<00:00:41.700> on

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
want is blue on the outside and white on

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.410 
want is blue on the outside and white on
the<00:00:41.970> inside

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the inside

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
the inside
so<00:00:42.720> we're<00:00:42.870> squishing<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> icing

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so we're squishing down all the icing

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.360 
so we're squishing down all the icing
under<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.090> sides<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:46.050> bag<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.340> we

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
under the sides of the bag and then we

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
under the sides of the bag and then we
just<00:00:47.730> open<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.239> again<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> spoon<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
just open it up again with a spoon and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
just open it up again with a spoon and
just<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.460> sure<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.540> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
just make sure that there's like a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
just make sure that there's like a
little<00:00:52.020> narrow<00:00:52.350> area<00:00:53.129> where<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
little narrow area where you can put the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
little narrow area where you can put the
white<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> center<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.079> also<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.590> put<00:00:55.620> some

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
white in the center but also I put some

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.590 
white in the center but also I put some
black<00:00:56.579> sorry<00:00:57.149> blue<00:00:57.450> icing<00:00:58.460> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.969> sides<00:01:00.239> on

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the back of a spoon and just sort of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
the back of a spoon and just sort of
mash<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.610> onto<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.120> sides<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.750> doesn't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
mash it up onto the sides it doesn't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
mash it up onto the sides it doesn't
have<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.469> be<00:01:04.589> exact<00:01:05.039> and<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.579> it's<00:01:06.090> not

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have to be exact and it it's not

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.780 
have to be exact and it it's not
scientific<00:01:07.170> thinkers<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.070> nature

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
scientific thinkers you know in nature

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
scientific thinkers you know in nature
everything<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.240> slightly<00:01:09.600> different<00:01:10.140> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
everything is slightly different but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
everything is slightly different but
just<00:01:10.950> try<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.190> get<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.640> much<00:01:11.790> blue<00:01:12.119> around<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
just try and get as much blue around the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.910 
just try and get as much blue around the
eyes<00:01:12.659> outside<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:21.619> then<00:01:22.619> grab<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
eyes outside as you can then grab the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
eyes outside as you can then grab the
white<00:01:23.490> icing<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> plain<00:01:24.840> icing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
white icing which is just a plain icing

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.370 
white icing which is just a plain icing
and<00:01:25.970> scoop<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> center<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:27.990> much<00:01:28.200> as

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and scoop it into the center as much as

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.219 
and scoop it into the center as much as
possible<00:01:28.830> again<00:01:29.369> don't<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.360> need<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
possible again don't you don't need to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
possible again don't you don't need to
worry<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.799> exact<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.580> just<00:01:33.270> try

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
worry that it's exact or not just try

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
worry that it's exact or not just try
and<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> middle<00:01:34.080> as<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.590> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and get in the middle as much as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649 
and get in the middle as much as
possible<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.240> mixing<00:01:36.600> of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
possible there will be some mixing of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.570 
possible there will be some mixing of
colors<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.290> fine

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.050 

bitch<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.110> bag<00:01:43.290> shots<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.910> make

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
bitch with the bag shots just to make

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.340 
bitch with the bag shots just to make
sure<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.390> icing<00:01:45.660> doesn't<00:01:45.780> come<00:01:46.050> out<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
sure the icing doesn't come out the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.760 
sure the icing doesn't come out the
wrong<00:01:46.500> end<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> always<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.650> at

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
wrong end and then what I always do at

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.280 
wrong end and then what I always do at
the<00:01:49.860> beginning<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.910> try<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.870> get<00:01:51.990> rid<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the beginning is I try and get rid of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.650 
the beginning is I try and get rid of
but<00:01:52.620> first<00:01:52.950> few<00:01:53.370> squirts<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.030> blue<00:01:54.450> because

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
but first few squirts of blue because

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.510 
but first few squirts of blue because
they'll<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.230> be<00:01:55.380> solid<00:01:55.740> blue<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.220> fine

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they'll just be solid blue which is fine

cupcake<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.260> outside<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.459> also

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
here I've got a piping bag with some

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.450 
here I've got a piping bag with some
purple<00:03:15.930> buttercream<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.620> some<00:03:17.070> white<00:03:17.220> butter

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
purple buttercream and some white butter

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.980 
purple buttercream and some white butter
creepin<00:03:17.850> up<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:18.270> just<00:03:18.480> filling<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
creepin up and I'm just filling in the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.840 
creepin up and I'm just filling in the
gaps<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.800> have<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.640> I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
gaps and we don't have to do this but I

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.540 
gaps and we don't have to do this but I
find<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.630> hydrangeas<00:03:22.260> are<00:03:22.470> usually<00:03:23.160> like

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
find that hydrangeas are usually like

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.910 
find that hydrangeas are usually like
several<00:03:23.940> colors<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.480> one<00:03:24.770> blossom<00:03:25.770> of

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
several colors in one blossom of

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.760 
several colors in one blossom of
hydrangea<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.210> this<00:03:27.360> sort<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.690> helps<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.200> mimic

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
hydrangea so this sort of helps to mimic
