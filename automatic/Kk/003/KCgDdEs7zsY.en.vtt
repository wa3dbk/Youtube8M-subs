00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.150
 we are here today at 40 in the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.030
 district university is all together 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.000
 the university the different faculties 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.880
 and they are gathered by a common feeling and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.380
 is that we are against the reform 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.110
 imposed by the superior council 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.870
 university does not want we do not admit the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.190
 agreement 008 and 009 that the council imposed 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 university superior and council 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 superior and legitimate decency is a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.150
 way to privatize the university 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.920
 district but if they could not do it 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.210
 with the reform to law 30 in 2011 in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.500
 this time reforms are being applied 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.390
 small inside the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 universities today this reform is a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.320
 shows of it and to that extent is a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.090
 fundamental weapon develop the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.430
 university constituent to stop 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.870
 this is where it has privatized now that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.270
 is landing on the university 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.490
 district in 2001 we made a congress 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.960
 university that they threw different 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.750
 conclusions of how to transform the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.600
 university in 2007 we also do 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.910
 a strike some mobilizations 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.040
 a few rallies and some assemblies and 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.149
 others and from there the conclusions 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.340
 to make a university constituent 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.390
 district universe to cut the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.090
 problem 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.920
 and the solution to the problem of conflict 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.630
 in the country to contribute to peace from the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 quality education worthy of dignity 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.530
 we have also evidenced during all 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.760
 these years for more than 20 years that the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 district university is a 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.020
 deep crisis that must be worked on 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.090
 from a participatory scenario 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.979
 democratic that really think a 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 co-government between the university in 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.759
 that can be built from the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.159
 university community an alternative 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.650
 real of a transforming university 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.180
 for the benefit of Bogota society and 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.180
 of you from Colombian society 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 in the defense of the public and in the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.360
 defense of the district university 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.740
 francisco or that is the university 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.620
 represented in students in 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 workers in interested teachers 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.060
 in defending the public university 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.950
 so that's why we think that better 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.450
 way in a broad constitutional power 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.459
 discuss what is the future of the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.660
 public education was very difficult the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.520
 process is to get at least 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.930
 different forces to conclude that yes 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.459
 indeed it is a possibility of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.410
 make the change the university 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.709
 we made a student coordinator 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.959
 that through the debates and other 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.880
 we said that indeed the mechanism 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.860
 of participation and democratization of the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.600
 university to the constituent because the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 constituent was the possibility of 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.860
 put into play the dialogues of all 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.200
 popular sectors of the same base 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.239
 student issue patches combos 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.560
 political organizations that character of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.060
 the university constituent having 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.700
 as input the university advisory 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.470
 that really counted on the contribution of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.730
 the entire university community but that 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.780
 it was only in a consultative 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.790
 that is to say, the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.560
 students if they want or do not want 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.269
 of the university but did not go beyond 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.330
 of a medical consultation that today again 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.069
 the hope of that 2001 2007 is reborn 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.599
 the student movement can do 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.599
 that university constituent 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.900
 look
