00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.860
 down a 6.6 hello short bending friends 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.570
 point is today we bring you a small video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 tutorial through which we want you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 show how to install in our 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.259
 Android device either smartphone or 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.779
 tablet any app apk through 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.119
 of the connection with our computer in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.399
 many times there is the possibility of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 to be able to download such file apeca in 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.790
 a certain way is simply a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 application that we can install 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.950
 directly on the device but in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.239
 other times it is not possible and so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.309
 we will have to do so via 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.199
 computer then we want to show it 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 how can we do it through our 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.910
 very good computer as you see here 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 we have our android device in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.379
 this case is a smartphone and here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 we have the apk file that would be a 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.510
 application in format let's say apk very 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 well the first thing we have to know is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 that the apk files can be downloaded 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.230
 directly from the internet there 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 numerous pages from 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 or you can even make use of a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.080
 web service that I'm going to leave in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 description of the video through which 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 simply copying the google link 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 play of the application that we want 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.000
 install on our device we can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 paste it into the service and automatically 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.530
 we will get the file download 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 apk normally this is usually done and it is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.190
 it is allowed to do with 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.680
 applications that are totally 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.180
 free 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.340
 very well the first thing that we will have to 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 do is configure our device 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.690
 to accept the installation of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 apk applications ie apps 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.810
 from an unknown source for this we 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 we will have to go to the settings 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 Of the device 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.760
 once we are in adjustments we go 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.760
 to security 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.040
 and in security as you see in the section 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.630
 device management we will have 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.940
 an option that would be the one of sources 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.960
 unknown which should be 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.340
 be activated 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.780
 when we activate shown us 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 message which we must accept 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 once we have accepted 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.100
 the configuration we will have to go to 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.590
 our computer 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.360
 and open access the device from 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.030
 our computer is also advisable 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.070
 have active usb debugging in 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 our android device very well 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.500
 as you see here we have the storage 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.060
 on the memory card or the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.060
 direct storage at the best 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.290
 in our case we are going to save the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.290
 apk file 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.410
 and we're going to give it the name files 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.530
 very well once the folder has been 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.530
 created we will simply have to 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.570
 inside the created folder 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.750
 while we have 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.999
 very well we can close the browser 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.670
 windows and now we turn to our 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:22.920
 device 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.819
 and we will go to the explorer of 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.819
 of the same 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 and here we have the storage of the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.800
 External SD card or storage 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.150
 internal device in this case 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.670
 as we have saved the file in the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.670
 memory card we press on it 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.300
 as you see the first option does not come out 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.440
 apk files that would be the folder that 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.690
 we have created and where we have introduced 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.330
 the file 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.120
 click to access 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.930
 and here we would have the apec file that 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.579
 we have copied 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.079
 well just to install it 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.079
 click on it 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.290
 and two options open to us to be able 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.740
 use said file in this case we do 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.500
 use of the package installer 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.500
 click on it and press only one 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.189
 we confirm the installation 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.700
 and once the installation of the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.430
 device will show us on the screen 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.500
 that said action has now ended 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.600
 same we can open directly from 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.330
 this screen the application or else exit 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.520

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.840
 click on the icon of that application in 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.250
 this case facebook 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.300
 we are going to press open 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.300
