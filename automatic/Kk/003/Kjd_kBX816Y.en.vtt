00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 I'm going to have a snack based on 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.759
 coconut that will go well with 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 the apple or the good of me I have 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.369
 the where there is nectarine the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.859
 little cream it's very simple we're going 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 put coconut dates of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.519
 vanilla and benoÃ®t de coco we will mix 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 it's all like a little cream 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.760
 caramel it's extra so I'm going 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 start by cutting meeddat 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.399
 you can also put them in the water 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.340
 a little bit earlier they will be more 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 soft but the only risk is that the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 cream become almost liquid and one 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.500
 wants it to be a cream we do not want 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 be it a drink one so I avoid 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.550
 from the east it depends how and in what 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.120
 state they are obviously if you have 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.989
 very dry dates it will be better 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.730
 maybe dip them a little bit 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 before in the water then then and taste 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.949
 water and take them take only the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.949
 dates 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.629
 so here I do not put a little blender 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 because it's a little bit 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:19.020
 little cream i put my dates i'm going m 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.939
 with a little coconut then it's 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.619
 difficult to count spoons when 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.180
 we have coconut pieces like that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.180
 let's say it's a big piece 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.480
 that's about 4 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 spoons and I'm going to take a third of 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.490
 cups of coconut water 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 I will put powdered vanilla 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 I mixed you continue until you sign 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.069
 more sensations of clashes to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.069
 inside we feel that everything is mixed 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.060
 it will obviously go faster in a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.020
 blender in invites to mx but good for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 the small amount 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 I preferred to take that 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:47.370
 here we get it in this little 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:54.660
 cream and I 'm going to put it in a little 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:00.330
 bowl this is super good it's really 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.860
 really delicious and we will cut I 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.239
 go cut slices of nectarines 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.560
 and in winter we can do that with 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.560
 apples or pear pieces 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.040
 and you have your little taste you 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.510
 deceive yourself delicately 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.490
 small pieces of nectarines that you 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.780
 fool in the sauce and you have a 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.780
 great for freedom
