00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
and then add about two inches on each

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.450 
and then add about two inches on each
side<00:00:50.650> so<00:00:51.010> you'll<00:00:51.640> have<00:00:51.790> enough<00:00:52.800> extra<00:00:53.800> wire<00:00:54.010> to

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
side so you'll have enough extra wire to

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.690 
side so you'll have enough extra wire to
work<00:00:54.610> with<00:00:55.560> so<00:00:56.560> I'll<00:00:56.829> go<00:00:56.980> ahead<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.489> take<00:00:57.670> my

work with so I'll go ahead and take my

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.590 
work with so I'll go ahead and take my
wire<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.860> grab<00:00:59.860> a<00:00:59.890> number<00:01:00.310> two<00:01:00.640> crimp<00:01:01.210> tube

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
wire and grab a number two crimp tube

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.440 
wire and grab a number two crimp tube
and<00:01:02.700> thread<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:03.940> wire<00:01:04.210> around<00:01:05.340> and<00:01:06.450> back

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
and thread that wire around and back

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.969 
and thread that wire around and back
through<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.110> crimp<00:01:08.920> tube<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:10.270> make<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.450> loop

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
through the crimp tube to make a loop

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.560 
through the crimp tube to make a loop
I'll<00:01:11.979> tighten<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.460> up<00:01:12.520> all<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.240> way<00:01:13.360> at<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
I'll tighten that up all the way at the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.740 
I'll tighten that up all the way at the
end<00:01:13.720> of<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.990> wire<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:15.120> use<00:01:16.120> my<00:01:16.330> crimping

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
end of the wire and use my crimping

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
end of the wire and use my crimping
pliers<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.770> crimp<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:18.070> tube<00:01:18.370> into<00:01:18.640> place

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
pliers to crimp that tube into place

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.570 
pliers to crimp that tube into place
once<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.670> have<00:01:21.909> your<00:01:22.479> crimp<00:01:22.780> tube<00:01:22.990> crimped

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
once you have your crimp tube crimped

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.899 
once you have your crimp tube crimped
we'll<00:01:24.580> go<00:01:24.729> ahead<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.120> just<00:01:25.720> snip<00:01:26.200> off<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:27.040> end

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
we'll go ahead and just snip off the end

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.800 
we'll go ahead and just snip off the end
of<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> wire<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:30.850> becomes<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.540> part

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
of the wire and this becomes the part

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.219 
of the wire and this becomes the part
that<00:01:32.740> will<00:01:32.890> slide<00:01:33.310> into<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.110> tube<00:01:35.350> clasp

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that will slide into the tube clasp

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.719 
that will slide into the tube clasp
before<00:01:38.229> we're<00:01:38.380> ready<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.710> do<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.040> we're

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
about the same length next you'll take

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.370 
about the same length next you'll take
your<00:04:00.840> clasp<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.790> thread<00:04:03.540> each<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.230> those

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
crimps into the opening of the slide too

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.509 
crimps into the opening of the slide too
so<00:04:09.570> each<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.870> these<00:04:10.140> wires<00:04:10.410> will<00:04:11.040> slide<00:04:11.310> right

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
so each of these wires will slide right

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.020 
so each of these wires will slide right
in<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.920> opening<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.489> side<00:04:14.730> squeeze
