00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 and good this time I bring you gameplay 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.710
 a party of strippers that was 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 playing with jl and with docu the truth is not 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'm not going to tell you that I'm a little bit and that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.220
 who knows that because I do not like to walk 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.520
 boasting about it I will not tell you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 it's a casual game, not because it was not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.859
 a casual game I definitely did 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.950
 many new caps or good snapshots 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.260
 as they want to call them here in halo 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.270
 and it's not something I do often not 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.960
 true the game was like that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.970
 causes fun and nothing more and 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.050
 good turned out to be a very good 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.290
 game in our favor obviously but 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.540
 good I wanted to take this this 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.370
 gameplay that came out to tell you that the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.450
 another one who was asking me is 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.760
 when it is there but if they are 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.500
 asking what do you think about the game 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.200
 sniper is very changed and who knows 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 that I said good is that we are going to 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.040
 this is a sign that we have to 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.390
 make a video about it 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.180
 as to what would be this 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.430
 Well, if they radically changed the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.280
 Yes Yes gameplay changed and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.830
 quite quite changed it because 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.620
 for example it is now easier to shoot 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.530
 in for example now there is less time 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.950
 between each shot and they're watching it in 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.080
 the gameplay there there are shots there are deaths 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.270
 that I managed to shoot very quickly 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.509
 because for example in the ritz the shot 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.509
 it was for something like that and here it's faster 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.930
 more progressive is more rhythmic still 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.170
 so good this one 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.940
 that, yes, it is a great change, not another 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.650
 thing they changed is like that the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.620
 ballistics like that they made him more 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.040
 realistic I do not know exactly what I 'm 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.830
 implying for example in halo 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.930
 reach I remember that one shot and the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.750
 bullet went straight no matter the distance 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.670
 the length no matter what the bullet 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.520
 I was going with the same speed 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.950
 address everything but here it is already 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.990
 quite different here apparently and by 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.150
 what I 've been noticing in some 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.400
 games that I have played 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.620
 is that the bullets now take a course 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
 different depends on the orientation that 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.830
 I will give them that is to say if one wants a 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200
 little to the right while shooting 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.209
 the bullet like that also takes a course 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
 to the right as it takes an effect 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.070
 I do not know happened I do not know is giving 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.290
 understand or is more I do not know if you have 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.590
 experienced that I do not know if I 'm 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.160
 making a mistake so good these are 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 changes in terms of gameplay 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.010
 and selling disadvantages forgiveness poetry and how 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.860
 you know the new servers have 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.330
 been failing pretty and good of 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.040
 done are not even servers the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 each game is adjusted by a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.150
 player and that is the problem of who 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100
 you have neighbors if the game is in your 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.560
 team in no way will you win 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.630
 although that is an e-mail and provoke 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 Thursday in game fords and win 5 thousand 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 dollars for each tournament you win from 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.820
 no way will you win do not give 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.220
 I know if you know why but if not 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.340
 Well, anyway, I will explain why 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.520
 example if I shoot and the ping eo of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.440
 host is minor and equivalent and is not 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.220
 equivalent to ours 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.470
 then the bullet will get delayed and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.450
 if the host if one is not house and you 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.580
 shoot the same game is going to have 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.700
 problems and the bullets are not even going 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.780
 to skim past then there is a 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.860
 little problem with that I hope that what 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.990
 arrange 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.240
 I expected them to put servers 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.130
 dedicated here the kilo 4 did not 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.560
 I'm going to talk seriously with the 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.690
 managers of tree for three because no 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.100
 it's not true but if it's like it's 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.010
 need not do so because 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.500
 like they could not do very well in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.420
 as to the adjustment or servers because 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 there are games that where the servers 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.630
 they are judged by players and they run well 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.070
 but but this is not the case 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.630
 misfortune but good I'm moving away 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.720
 much the subject of the snipers in 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.010
 more stuck to the game good another 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.600
 disadvantage right now that I 'm 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.790
 agreeing and right now I was seeing the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 another gameplay of another disadvantage 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.940
 only two are only two are other 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.160
 advantage is that if you are shot in doubt 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.040
 culatazo huge move you give a 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.810
 exceptional way that is to say it was a taste 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.190
 as if they were shooting you with a 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.639
 rocket launcher and they were not 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.680
 doing the same years 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.419
 Now many are asking that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.430
 I did about the snapshots I know that 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.870
 some have not played snipers 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.449
 because they have to say that you have to hurry 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.099
 campero although the pleasant surprise 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.219
 surprise that I take is that there is no 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.020
 as much campero as I expected 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.759
 in this same game you can see that the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.590
 two players from the other team did not 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.599
 they went past, they went over 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.560
 moving between the map and all that and 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.759
 that signature for big or that is not the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.310
 champions do not depend on the type of 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.159
 match but the type of player with the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.349
 so it's your turn to play that finally and 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.750
 out so that's not to be 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.569
 worry a lot that I'm going with this to that 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.159
 many told me this many of those who 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.080
 they asked me what I thought about the 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.419
 Tibet Ravers was because they did not want 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.240
 play for campers and then they are from 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.180
 those four who are very concerned about their 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 king tve low deaths of that divide 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.800
 your dead for the times you killed 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.750
 something like that 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.250
 and they worry that it's positive and 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.080
 negative then you do not want to get 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.440
 here because it says that if it's full of 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.470
 campers are going to lose this one because they're going to 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.270
 lose that positivism in your rating but 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.430
 for all of them I want to say that no 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.520
 there are no campers 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.870
 there's absolutely no good I'm not going to 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.910
 be absolutely because it is to be 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.490
 exaggerating I have played games where 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.860
 if there are enough camper uncles in the other 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.020
 team and on my team too but 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.480
 process with what fortunately is 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.840
 can deal with the eternal in fact not 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.850
 I know if they dried there was a scene and the 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.890
 gameplay where he saw a guy hid 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.110
 behind a rock and I cheated on him 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.770
 apply as they would say many fool you 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.480
 saying and making him believe that he is 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.040
 here that was there to them like that 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.750
 hidden and then I moved I do not know what 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.860
 so many things I did the joke is that what 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.630
 I killed and then I got rid of him, but not my 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.580
 opinion about this type of game 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.310
 Well, I liked the snej but I 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.160
 liked it is also very different and loyal 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.370
 to halo reach and I told them as soon as 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.590
 to ballistics in terms of movement 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.960
 he reached to distinguish if he moves more 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.090
 this well the ritz because halo reach 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.650
 I have not played it for a long time 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.030
 I made me I've been gone stale 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.030
 in here in halo 4 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.790
 but I do not know he or the movement 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.610
 definitely if it's different, not if it's 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.820
 quite different but but it's nothing 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.980
 outside is not nothing that moves away from 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.110
 fundamentals let's go let's it is not it 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.670
 call of duty hero because many 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.400
 they are saying that hello is more call 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.430
 of duty kg and it is in some aspects 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.890
 maybe yes but in others not so so 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.230
 good you have to give it hard there's no 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.570
 that try to strive see for example 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.550
 that is one of the plays that 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.400
 I did against campero his I did not 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.470
 they won but others and I managed to give him and 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.330
 as for cache those who also 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.640
 they were saying that there are guys that you 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.200
 They arrive and you begin to take as the 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.480
 truth there are not many good we are going to 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.670
 explain this cost this cachero me 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.560
 I think in another video because right now 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.600
 I'm running out of time so 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.760
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.770
 video from the exiguous if they put in their 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.060
 comments your opinions about this 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.490
 type of games and that is that you no longer 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.740
 have played share it with their friends 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.960
 so they see so they know more or less 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.670
 what to soak in the subject of 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.950
 this from team managers 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:01.090
 and good, your friend says goodbye 

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.090
 Little bird gamer 

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.419
 and not 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.790
 with my name
