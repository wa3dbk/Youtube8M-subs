00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.840
 Military aircraft under attack the swollen Richthofen leaves so must 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 keep thinking 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.749
 the fascination of 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.370
 she is legendary 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 but for some, photographing aircraft has one at least as well 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.100
 great fascination 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.540
 and that's not all the food they call themselves and more 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.850
 Hundreds of them visited the Jagdgeschwader 71 Richthofen on 5 June 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 in the North German dedication 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.310
 Where else planes park this day grabs a formidable Flechtner 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.220
 Wiener 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.220
 because for a real athlete is not 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.300
 the streamers of pearls from Dranse that is about 150 kilometers 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.070
 Although 50 kilometers 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 So who is around 20 kilometers 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 found 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.630
 and nobody knows anything about her percent 500 kilometers 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.930
 There are six nations over a waltz 56 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.500
 with a wide from 9 to 12 o'clock 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 have become meaningless on the 12th 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.760
 but who are all these people 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.400
 Those who take such stretches and hardships laden with heavy ones 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.760
 photographic equipment 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 and always on the hunt for the best shot 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.250
 Knipper whether aircraft books 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.820
 easy is the sympathetic people usually currently lies fifth 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.710
 are then sometimes a bit wilder in the limited 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.140
 also he has nothing from Holland but airplanes in the head or on the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.870
 head 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.190
 he is a true Sforza a hobby that has been his life 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.120
 accompanied 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.229
 the b 2 percent 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.469
 I've been around 12 2 percent for 20 years now 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.440
 think afterwards 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.750
 I think frequent flyer clone percent per plane sport 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.639
 the heart of the dutchman cut especially for the phantom 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.099
 shoots the Briton 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.409
 that is terrible 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.259
 it's a lot to learn 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.269
 for me, I am very beautiful and left 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.010
 very many things do not make modern aircraft anymore alone 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.439
 can do 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.489
 as close as here come the athlete 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.679
 very rarely to the mesh 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:37.009
 So entering an Air Force Base is something special 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.509
 Normally, the highest safety precautions and that prevail here 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 Taking photos is strictly prohibited 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.099
 but always stupid ball from the north 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.840
 Percent we have the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the association 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.969
 and we are starting these celebrations with the one just taking place here 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.969
 Percent so gave Spot everyday 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.599
 Percent and there we give all of these restrictions to percent below the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.769
 Circulation that the athletes had previously registered with us 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.150
 this portal is now all on square four 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.310
 rather and their hobby No you have to say more than calling it is ultimately 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.789
 to photograph on airplanes 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:13.990
 Euro and you see yes 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.239
 here only happy faces 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.339
 because people are all in seventh heaven right now 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.529
 and this seventh heaven is no coincidence 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.819
 the whole morning on agricultural machinery of various types 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.409
 European countries and the 50th anniversary of the squadron 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.839
 to congratulate 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.599
 an impressive backdrop 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
 Lots of goodies for diehard fort 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.539
 many of them are not just specialists on the camera but 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.859
 also have an impressive knowledge of the objects of theirs 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.059
 Desire that is always enriching for me also always only percent 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.909
 based on a key figure of an aircraft 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.539
 out of the head 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.969
 can ultimately retrieve more than twenty years of history of this aircraft 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.399
 that could not be filled with life at all and that comes out of it 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:01.139
 was standing 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.009
 everything is just fascinating 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.500
 the trophy of the portal is and remains the successful photos 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.170
 And in the course of a long commercial spot, there's a lot going on 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.049
 I have 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.650
 perhaps five deaths are now overturned under the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.749
 affiliated album before 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:23.789
 and the next 20 30 thousand photos that no longer saves 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.509
 the photos used to be dusty in old times 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.839
 Today they are being published more and more on the internet than anybody 

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.469
 Sportsman who holds something on himself 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.860

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 and a little more club almost everything Porter with each other 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.639
 the one goose 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.199
 Ben's big dream 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.139
 Hindenburg is 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.120
 in the way and to one 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.740
 a mixture with satisfied
