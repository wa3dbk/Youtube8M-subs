there's only a few things on that that's

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
there's only a few things on that that's
probably<00:01:25.530> pretty<00:01:25.799> good<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> can

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
probably pretty good and if you can

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
probably pretty good and if you can
pronounce<00:01:27.900> everything<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.829> label<00:01:29.009> and

pronounce everything on that label and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
pronounce everything on that label and
get<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.030> probably<00:01:30.299> pretty<00:01:30.450> good<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
get is probably pretty good if there's a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.130 
get is probably pretty good if there's a
whole<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.920> numbers<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.900> stay<00:01:33.900> away

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
whole little numbers on that stay away

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
whole little numbers on that stay away
from<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.470> stay<00:01:35.130> away<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.640> chemicals

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
from it stay away from the chemicals

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.359 
from it stay away from the chemicals
because<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> chemicals<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.619> they

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
because what the chemicals do is they

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.630 
because what the chemicals do is they
make<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.390> addicted<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.049> those<00:01:40.200> foods
