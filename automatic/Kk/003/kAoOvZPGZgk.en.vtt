 this video is only 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.309
 opinion 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.040

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 hello with you captain steve is both test 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 com and today we will conduct a test review 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 in a boat which is considered ideal for 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.269
 cruising is swift 44 swift 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.150
 44 was designed as a replacement 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.449
 popular 42 and is a continuation 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 lines swift and symbolizes aspiration 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.469
 run away from don't be let's see how 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.239
 the developers have tried and look 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.149
 inside length swift 44 13.9 meters width 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 4 meters 25 centimeters with this draft 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 is only 1 meter 5 centimeters 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 weight of our yacht during the test 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.960
 amounted to exactly 12 thousand one hundred thirty 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.879
 four kilos you can get on 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 board of the yacht passing through the dome 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 platform or use the door with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 right side of the bulwark swift 44 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.719
 looks asymmetrical the width of the passage 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.540
 starboard a little wider than on the left 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.640
 special door on the starboard side 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 weatherproof cockpit on this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 side of the deck under the stairs leading 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.380
 in the bow are boxes and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.689
 the fuel filler on the yacht's tank is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.150
 sturdy pipe railing 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.640
 almost 75 centimeters high 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 winch humor is already installed in the base 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.770
 configuration, however, you can manage it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 only from the wheelhouse if in the cabin 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.780
 clean the table and carpeting 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.150
 open access to the engine compartment 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 this room is spacious enough for 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 order to inspect the engine 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.040
 and minor repairs 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.140
 but here you need to add lighting 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.659
 the boat is equipped with good sound insulation 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.200
 so even at full speed the sound in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.540
 cabin does not exceed 79 decibels front 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 parts of the cabin is the post control 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.000
 it is equipped with a slightly inclined panel with 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 optional 12 inch display left 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.680
 control display is located 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.810
 autopilot and on the right a nose joystick 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.120
 thruster between 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.040
 analog devices have a display 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.790
 volvo engine management systems 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 penta 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 appear and double white captain's seat 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 can be used unfolded 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 or tilt the seat cushion and side 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.580
 doors provide excellent visibility and 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.099
 ventilation if you stand at the helm of you 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.010
 360 degree view opens 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.230
 cockpit staircase leads to fly bridge 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.450
 the steering wheel is located in front in the center 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.280
 panels i can easily look down 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.230
 sides and simultaneously control the boat 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.810
 I personally prefer to moor 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.519
 driving yachts from the lower deck and this 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.830
 very easy to do alone i 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.400
 light-skinned Irishman praised 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.050
 the presence of 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.629
 tilt roof over the post control 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.300
 the size of the control panel is the same 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.670
 like below except 9 inch 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.069
 of the display as soon as we broke the anchor I 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 was very surprised by the maneuverability of the swift 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.769
 44 at low speed turns were 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.349
 soft enough not to deliver 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.930
 discomfort of the passenger on board I noted 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.930
 only 5 degree cream when we entered 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.239
 cook swift 44 perfectly controlled and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.940
 so that I do not do it with the yacht 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.980
 calm and confident visibility was 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.530
 excellent thanks to first-class 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.780
 panoramic glazing we had a good 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.930
 calm day, I still managed something where 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.269
 find elevator track swift 44 goes 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.190
 right well splashing the water and not at all 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.560
 hitting the wave as for 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.040
 performance then two volvo diesel 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 penta 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.209
 die 4 with a power of 300 for two 1600 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.959
 rpm accelerated our yacht to 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.330
 maximum speed of 25.6 knots when 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.090
 this we burned one hundred and six liters per hour 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.709
 which gives autonomy at 303 days in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.080
 top cruise boats clean 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.350
 hypothetically power reserve decreases 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.690
 directly proportional 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.150
 increase in power if you go back to 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.050
 numbers at a speed of 22.6 knots at 2250 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.200
 rpm 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.150
 fuel consumption is 85 liters per 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.570
 an hour that is one nautical mile 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.640
 spent almost 4 liters of fuel swift 44 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.910
 showed an excellent time to exit 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.070
 gliding 6.3 seconds up to thirty 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.180
 two kilometers per hour the boat accelerates 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.400
 in 8.5 seconds I measured the chassis 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.080
 differentialin is only 10 degrees captain and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.530
 as short as I deserved 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.900
 will appreciate folding footboard standing on this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.330
 the substrate I was a direct line of sight 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.080
 horizon at all speeds and at any 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.390
 differential 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.910
 as soon as swift 44 finishes 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.710
 planing the boat sinks by about 5 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.140
 degrees when mooring you really 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.700
 enjoy the opportunity to see the whole board 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.770
 side door boats 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.080
 and you can still see both sides of karma 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.780
 at the same time keep your hand on 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.610
 pulse is best seen here when 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.740
 I align the wheel in the center and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.110
 use engines separately to 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.730
 carry the boat back here is the effective 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.100
 handling and accuracy without 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.850
 the need for bow thrusters 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.570
 device 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.730
 until the moment benetton stops 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.500
 managed to create a comfortable cruise yacht 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.080
 which goes well on gliding 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.270
 while having a significant power reserve and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.140
 this is all an economical option 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.210
 yard and 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.670
 which one person can easily handle 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.470
 if we are talking about traveling couple 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.670
 it was a performance review 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.200
 Swift r4 assisted by bolt and captain 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.200
 steve see you on the water
