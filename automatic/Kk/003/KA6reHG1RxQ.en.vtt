kind of a lawn trailer and it has an
area<00:01:09.460> right<00:01:10.180> here<00:01:10.240> for<00:01:10.990> my<00:01:11.200> race<00:01:12.100> ramps<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:13.380> did

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
area right here for my race ramps I did

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.380 
area right here for my race ramps I did
install<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:15.600> winch<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.590> if<00:01:17.890> if<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.759> can't<00:01:19.060> start

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
install a winch so if if I can't start

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.050 
install a winch so if if I can't start
the<00:01:19.479> vehicle<00:01:20.080> at<00:01:20.259> least<00:01:20.470> I'd<00:01:20.649> be<00:01:20.679> able<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.310> pull

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the vehicle at least I'd be able to pull

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.260 
the vehicle at least I'd be able to pull
it<00:01:22.210> up<00:01:22.360> onto<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.960> ramp<00:01:23.470> but<00:01:23.679> I<00:01:23.979> think<00:01:24.670> her<00:01:24.909> to

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
it up onto the ramp but I think her to

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.210 
it up onto the ramp but I think her to
the<00:01:25.390> trailer<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.780> think<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.560> drive<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.100> on

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
the trailer I think I can drive it on

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.940 
the trailer I think I can drive it on
there<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.850> did<00:01:28.630> well<00:01:28.899> as<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.380> saw<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.830> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.840 
video and I have just enough room for it
to<00:01:35.350> close<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:39.039> guys<00:01:39.250> down<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.670> Texas<00:01:41.850> put

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.249 
these in and what that does
especially<00:01:47.470> back<00:01:47.709> here<00:01:48.159> just<00:01:48.520> keeps<00:01:48.909> these

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
especially back here just keeps these

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
especially back here just keeps these
from<00:01:50.259> kicking<00:01:50.740> out<00:01:50.890> when<00:01:51.190> I'm<00:01:51.340> driving<00:01:51.610> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
from kicking out when I'm driving up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.639 
from kicking out when I'm driving up
definitely<00:01:53.229> have<00:01:53.709> that<00:01:53.819> input<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:56.349> it

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
definitely have that input and it it

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.260 
definitely have that input and it it
hooks<00:01:57.340> behind<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:58.030> lip<00:01:59.879> don't<00:02:00.879> pry<00:02:01.209> it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
hooks behind this lip don't pry it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.809 
hooks behind this lip don't pry it
without<00:02:01.599> it<00:02:02.050> those<00:02:02.470> we<00:02:02.800> already<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.580> been

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
without it those we already have been

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.820 
without it those we already have been
there<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.959> in<00:02:05.739> the<00:02:06.009> back<00:02:06.190> wheel<00:02:07.619> kicked<00:02:08.619> it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
there and in the back wheel kicked it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
there and in the back wheel kicked it
out<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:13.500> wanted<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.769> see<00:02:14.980> this

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
out there so I wanted you to see this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.620 
out there so I wanted you to see this
gal<00:02:16.330> let's<00:02:16.599> close<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.410> time<00:02:20.129> yep

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:38.860 

you<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.870> put<00:02:25.020> one<00:02:25.050> pan<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:34.010> yeah<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.250> pen<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.740 

and<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.080> goes<00:02:40.230> down<00:02:40.530> through<00:02:40.890> both<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.130> them

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and it goes down through both of them

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.080 
and it goes down through both of them
okay<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.640> widest<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
okay so this is the widest that the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.680 
okay so this is the widest that the
d-o-t<00:02:48.750> will<00:02:49.050> allow<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:50.459> you're<00:02:50.790> only<00:02:51.030> looking

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
d-o-t will allow so you're only looking

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.540 
d-o-t will allow so you're only looking
at<00:02:52.440> about<00:02:52.940> an<00:02:53.940> inch<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> half<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.950> either

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
at about an inch and a half on either

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.540 
at about an inch and a half on either
side<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.800> got<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> work<00:03:02.250> with

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
side so that's what you got to work with

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.760 
side so that's what you got to work with
and<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.750> had<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.959> do<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.470> over

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and I think if I had to do this over

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.630 
and I think if I had to do this over
again<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.550> would<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:08.880> probably<00:03:09.239> had<00:03:09.720> this

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
again I would have probably had this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.190 
again I would have probably had this
enclosure<00:03:11.640> built<00:03:12.300> out<00:03:12.720> over<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:14.959> it's<00:03:15.959> just

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
enclosure built out over this it's just

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.310 
enclosure built out over this it's just
a<00:03:16.350> little<00:03:16.530> closed<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.970> see<00:03:18.270> how<00:03:18.660> close<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.290> am

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
a little closed you see how close I am

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.160 
a little closed you see how close I am
but<00:03:19.650> hey<00:03:20.400> Plus<00:03:20.970> don't<00:03:21.270> matter<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:22.050> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
but hey Plus don't matter that it's the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
but hey Plus don't matter that it's the
one<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.350> tie<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.739> down<00:03:23.180> I've<00:03:24.180> got<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.830> cleat<00:03:25.830> there

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
one I tie it down I've got a cleat there

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.880 
one I tie it down I've got a cleat there
and<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.470> tie-down<00:03:29.010> point<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.650> lower

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
and this is the tie-down point the lower

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.699 
and this is the tie-down point the lower
arm<00:03:32.310> over<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> other<00:03:33.660> side<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.709> have

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
arm over on the other side and I have

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.420 
arm over on the other side and I have
them<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.040> put<00:03:38.280> me<00:03:38.489> one<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.160> this<00:03:41.160> is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
them to put me one here and this is

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.640 
them to put me one here and this is
going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.930> tie<00:03:42.930> down<00:03:42.959> through<00:03:43.920> there<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.549> back

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
going to tie down through there and back

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.620 
going to tie down through there and back
one<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.799> either<00:03:47.010> side<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:49.019> oh<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:51.570> is

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
one on either side so oh and this is

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.100 
one on either side so oh and this is
called<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.320> gorilla<00:03:53.010> left<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:55.350> assists<00:03:55.890> in

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
called a gorilla left and it assists in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.500 
called a gorilla left and it assists in
lowering<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.380> raising<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:59.130> ramp<00:03:59.880> which<00:04:00.150> can

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
lowering and raising that ramp which can

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.580 
lowering and raising that ramp which can
be<00:04:00.690> pretty<00:04:01.049> heavy<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.799> would<00:04:02.190> definitely

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
be pretty heavy so I would definitely

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
be pretty heavy so I would definitely
get<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.920> those<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:06.510> got<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> custom

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
get one of those we got the custom
