on what I can do

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.619 
on what I can do
the<00:03:01.439> most<00:03:01.680> simple<00:03:04.519> answer<00:03:05.519> would<00:03:06.000> be<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.450> just

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
the most simple answer would be to just

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.479 
the most simple answer would be to just
remove<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> mirror<00:03:07.169> remove<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.129> mirror<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
remove the mirror remove the mirror and

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.470 
remove the mirror remove the mirror and
then<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.609> wouldn't<00:03:08.879> really<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.209> any

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
then I wouldn't really have any

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.500 
then I wouldn't really have any
reflective<00:03:10.049> lighting<00:03:10.590> from<00:03:10.799> light<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:12.030> like

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.260 
dusty rose I like to apply this on top
of<00:06:05.050> my<00:06:05.199> lid<00:06:05.650> after<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.490> have<00:06:06.849> put<00:06:07.060> on<00:06:07.150> my

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
of my lid after I have put on my

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.089 
of my lid after I have put on my
eyeliner<00:06:07.419> I<00:06:07.870> like<00:06:08.199> to<00:06:08.319> do<00:06:08.469> this<00:06:08.620> because<00:06:08.949> this

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
eyeliner I like to do this because this

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.409 
eyeliner I like to do this because this
product<00:06:09.370> does<00:06:09.669> have<00:06:09.849> a<00:06:09.879> little<00:06:10.210> bit<00:06:10.300> of

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
product does have a little bit of

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.510 
product does have a little bit of
texture<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:11.110> it<00:06:11.139> so<00:06:11.469> I<00:06:11.500> personally<00:06:11.919> find<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.430> a

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
texture to it so I personally find it a

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.850 
texture to it so I personally find it a
little<00:06:12.729> difficult<00:06:12.969> to<00:06:13.449> apply<00:06:14.110> eyeliner<00:06:14.560> on

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
little difficult to apply eyeliner on

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.010 
little difficult to apply eyeliner on
top<00:06:15.009> so<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:15.550> just<00:06:15.849> prefer<00:06:16.150> doing<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.599> after<00:06:16.990> I

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
top so I just prefer doing it after I

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:25.150 
top so I just prefer doing it after I
have<00:06:17.319> put<00:06:17.469> the<00:06:17.560> eyeliner<00:06:17.770> on

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.680 

so<00:06:26.160> now<00:06:26.310> it's<00:06:26.490> time<00:06:26.730> to<00:06:26.910> pop<00:06:27.090> on<00:06:27.240> some<00:06:27.450> false

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
so now it's time to pop on some false

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.510 
so now it's time to pop on some false
lashes<00:06:27.810> I'm<00:06:28.380> not<00:06:28.740> exactly<00:06:29.010> sure<00:06:29.310> what<00:06:29.340> number
