00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and so put it together buddy how you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.170 
and so put it together buddy how you
okay<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.740> system<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
okay what about this system this is the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.810 
okay what about this system this is the
unique<00:02:28.390> part<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> my<00:02:29.710> first<00:02:30.040> design<00:02:30.430> was

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
unique part of it my first design was

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.690 
unique part of it my first design was
just<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:32.050> pinion<00:02:32.320> rod<00:02:32.500> here<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.460> cam

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
just the the pinion rod here in the cam

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.290 
just the the pinion rod here in the cam
and<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.870> had<00:02:35.260> taken<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.860> DS<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.550> with<00:02:36.790> my<00:02:36.970> hand

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
and I had taken the DS and with my hand

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360 
and I had taken the DS and with my hand
figured<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.470> needs<00:02:38.830> about<00:02:39.010> two

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
figured out that it needs about two

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.840 
figured out that it needs about two
inches<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.730> travel<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.980> put<00:02:42.220> my<00:02:42.340> travel

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
inches of travel so so I put my travel

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.300 
inches of travel so so I put my travel
in<00:02:43.030> my<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:44.800> cam<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.470> when<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> ran<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.130> it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
in my my cam here and when I ran it it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.850 
in my my cam here and when I ran it it
didn't<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.480> didn't<00:02:49.840> work<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.350> didn't<00:02:50.650> count

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
didn't it didn't work it didn't count

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.160 
didn't it didn't work it didn't count
off<00:02:51.070> feet<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.910> figured<00:02:52.600> there<00:02:52.810> was<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> little

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
off feet so I figured there was a little

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.030 
off feet so I figured there was a little
shake<00:02:53.590> involved<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:55.270> put<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> sleeve<00:02:56.620> on

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
shake involved and I put a sleeve on

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.120 
shake involved and I put a sleeve on
here<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.020> drill<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.200> hole<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.980> put<00:03:00.070> a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
here and drill the hole in it and put a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.390 
here and drill the hole in it and put a
spring<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:00.640> there<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:03.040> bit<00:03:03.370> of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
spring in there so that little bit of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.180 
spring in there so that little bit of
Bounce<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:05.050> what<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> needed<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:06.010> those

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
Bounce it's what I needed to get those

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.770 
Bounce it's what I needed to get those
what<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.520> like<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> equivalent<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.540> walk

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
what I like the equivalent of you walk

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.780 
what I like the equivalent of you walk
it<00:03:07.989> with<00:03:08.140> walking<00:03:08.800> with<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.190> your<00:03:09.370> pocket

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
it with walking with it in your pocket

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.840

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
and this is me walking right a little

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.140 
and this is me walking right a little
bit<00:03:13.000> noisier<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.650> uh<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.459> does<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.880> for

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
bit noisier but uh but this does it for

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.009 
bit noisier but uh but this does it for
you<00:03:16.330> okay<00:03:16.780> let's<00:03:17.140> see<00:03:17.320> what<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.560> got<00:03:17.769> here

garage you know for a couple hours or

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.040 
garage you know for a couple hours or
whatever<00:03:35.550> it's<00:03:35.970> kind<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.209> noisy<00:03:36.330> but<00:03:36.780> yeah

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
whatever it's kind of noisy but yeah

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.600 
whatever it's kind of noisy but yeah
it's<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.319> little<00:03:37.440> bit<00:03:37.650> noisy<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.129> think<00:03:38.489> I'm

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
it's a little bit noisy I think I'm

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.770 
it's a little bit noisy I think I'm
gonna<00:03:38.760> try<00:03:39.330> writing<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.110> little<00:03:40.379> bit

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
gonna try writing it down a little bit

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.570 
gonna try writing it down a little bit
my<00:03:42.780> intentions<00:03:43.290> are<00:03:43.349> also<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.830> put<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> timer<00:03:44.370> on

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
my intentions are also to put a timer on

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.100 
my intentions are also to put a timer on
it<00:03:44.760> because<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.090> takes<00:03:45.300> about<00:03:45.540> four<00:03:46.080> minutes

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
it because it takes about four minutes

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.370 
it because it takes about four minutes
to<00:03:46.800> get<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.099> thousand<00:03:47.670> steps<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:49.170> would

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
to get the thousand steps and that would

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.300 
to get the thousand steps and that would
be<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.280> here

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.980 

well<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.410> so<00:03:59.800> with<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.130> timer<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.690> would<00:04:01.840> be

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
well so so with the timer you would be

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.520 
well so so with the timer you would be
able<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.230> just<00:04:02.910> turn<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.120> walk<00:04:04.480> away<00:04:04.810> come
