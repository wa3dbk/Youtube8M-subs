00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
the surgeon reinforced this that protein

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.990

shakes<00:03:10.060> are<00:03:11.250> supposed<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.430> done<00:03:12.579> now<00:03:12.790> I

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
shakes are supposed to be done now I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.090 
shakes are supposed to be done now I
don't<00:03:13.269> need<00:03:13.480> them<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.840> should<00:03:14.290> only<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.890> them

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
don't need them I should only need them

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.190 
don't need them I should only need them
if<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.519> really<00:03:15.850> have<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.000> low<00:03:16.209> protein<00:03:16.480> day<00:03:16.900> I

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
if I really have a low protein day I

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.949 
if I really have a low protein day I
need<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.040> let<00:03:18.639> my<00:03:18.819> body<00:03:19.000> learn<00:03:19.389> how<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.630> handle

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
need to let my body learn how to handle

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.500 
need to let my body learn how to handle
food<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.470> how<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:21.160> digest<00:03:21.730> food<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.299> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
food and how to digest food in the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.379 
food and how to digest food in the
quantities<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.739> able<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.100> eat<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.120> then

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
quantities that I'm able to eat and then

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.440 
quantities that I'm able to eat and then
just<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:26.980> food<00:03:27.250> person<00:03:27.609> not<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> protein

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
just be a food person not a protein

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.970 
just be a food person not a protein
shake<00:03:28.480> person<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.260> was<00:03:29.500> interesting

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
shake person so that was interesting

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.800 
shake person so that was interesting
because<00:03:30.370> I've<00:03:30.639> seen<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.000> many<00:03:31.120> people<00:03:31.329> who<00:03:31.600> are

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
because I've seen so many people who are

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.710 
because I've seen so many people who are
still<00:03:32.079> using<00:03:32.260> protein<00:03:32.920> shakes<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.720> maybe

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
still using protein shakes and maybe

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.420 
still using protein shakes and maybe
it's<00:03:34.930> forgetting<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.920> protein<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.400> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
it's forgetting just the protein in that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.940 
it's forgetting just the protein in that
you<00:03:36.700> don't<00:03:36.880> get<00:03:37.060> from<00:03:37.350> meat<00:03:38.350> during<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.799> day

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
you don't get from meat during the day

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.349
