really what it is is in very dark dark
colored<00:01:56.369> skin<00:01:56.700> ie<00:01:57.390> black<00:01:57.930> skin<00:01:58.320> types<00:01:58.619> now<00:01:59.490> the

colored skin ie black skin types now the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.730

and really we're helping to control a
great<00:02:38.220> deal<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.970> use<00:02:39.180> IPL<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.049> those

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
great deal when we use IPL on those

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.680 
great deal when we use IPL on those
people<00:02:40.650> because<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> problem

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
people because it really is a problem

paid my underarms we're two sessions

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.920 
paid my underarms we're two sessions
which<00:03:43.570> was<00:03:43.810> fantastic<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:45.060> great<00:03:46.060> machine

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
which was fantastic and great machine

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.920 
which was fantastic and great machine
there's<00:03:47.560> three<00:03:47.890> cooling<00:03:48.370> systems<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.180> IPL

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
there's three cooling systems in the IPL

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.530 
there's three cooling systems in the IPL
machine<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:51.400> make<00:03:51.790> our<00:03:51.970> workhorse<00:03:52.410> also

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
machine to make our workhorse also

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.229 
machine to make our workhorse also
because<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.720> three<00:03:55.989> cooling<00:03:56.380> systems<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
because of the three cooling systems the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.760 
because of the three cooling systems the
water<00:03:58.450> comes<00:03:58.690> through<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.110> handle<00:03:59.500> here

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
water comes through the handle here

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.850 
water comes through the handle here
through<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.180> crystal<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.900> ice<00:04:02.380> cold

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
through so that the crystal is ice cold

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.070 
through so that the crystal is ice cold
when<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.400> put<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.180> integrated

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
when you put it so it's integrated

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.890 
when you put it so it's integrated
cooling<00:04:05.530> which<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.400> lot<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.760> laser<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.750> IPL

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
cooling which a lot of laser and IPL

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.590 
cooling which a lot of laser and IPL
systems<00:04:08.560> do<00:04:08.770> not<00:04:08.800> have<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:09.790> integrated

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600

pulling<00:04:10.989> into<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.410> crystal<00:04:11.770> means<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.610> when

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
pulling into the crystal means that when

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.580 
pulling into the crystal means that when
you<00:04:12.820> touch<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.300> skin<00:04:13.510> with<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.750> crystal<00:04:14.020> the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
you touch the skin with a crystal the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.020 
you touch the skin with a crystal the
crystal<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:15.280> ice<00:04:15.550> cold<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.769> tremendous

other the other really great thing about
the<00:05:17.490> hair<00:05:17.940> removal<00:05:18.480> is<00:05:18.870> that<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.800> put<00:05:20.280> one

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
the hair removal is that I put one

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.800 
the hair removal is that I put one
handle<00:05:21.470> for<00:05:22.470> all<00:05:22.920> skin<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.640> all<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:25.020> all

handle for all skin and all and all
sizes<00:05:27.810> for<00:05:28.230> this<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.310> you're<00:05:29.430> seeing

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
sizes for this this that you're seeing

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.120 
sizes for this this that you're seeing
here<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.240> crystal<00:05:30.660> size<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:31.260> do<00:05:31.410> upper<00:05:31.920> lips

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
here the crystal size can do upper lips

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.660 
here the crystal size can do upper lips
chins<00:05:33.170> bikinis<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.350> legs<00:05:34.680> there's<00:05:34.980> no<00:05:35.280> need

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
chins bikinis and legs there's no need

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.610 
chins bikinis and legs there's no need
to<00:05:35.700> change<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.390> handle<00:05:36.750> because<00:05:36.900> this<00:05:37.350> size

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
to change the handle because this size

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.750 
to change the handle because this size
works<00:05:38.400> quickly<00:05:38.700> in<00:05:38.970> all<00:05:39.180> areas<00:05:40.010> okay<00:05:41.010> the

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
works quickly in all areas okay the

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.400 
works quickly in all areas okay the
other<00:05:41.850> thing<00:05:42.120> is<00:05:42.150> when<00:05:42.420> you're<00:05:42.600> doing<00:05:42.990> anemia

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
other thing is when you're doing anemia

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.030 
other thing is when you're doing anemia
you<00:05:44.010> must<00:05:44.390> overlap<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:46.020> handle<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.830> put

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
you must overlap the handle and you put

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.280 
you must overlap the handle and you put
it<00:05:47.190> down<00:05:47.280> in<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.610> crystal<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.450> must<00:05:48.660> overlap

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
it down in the crystal you must overlap

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.310 
it down in the crystal you must overlap
the<00:05:49.530> idea<00:05:49.800> by<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.100> third<00:05:50.550> that's<00:05:51.300> because<00:05:51.780> some

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
the idea by a third that's because some

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.320 
the idea by a third that's because some
of<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.560> energy<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:53.220> lost<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.880> read<00:05:54.120> the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
of the energy is lost and read the

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.440 
of the energy is lost and read the
crystal<00:05:55.130> okay<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.760> maximum<00:05:56.940> length<00:05:57.300> of

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
crystal okay and the maximum length of

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.930 
crystal okay and the maximum length of
energy<00:05:57.750> happens<00:05:58.170> here<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:59.190> what<00:05:59.520> we<00:05:59.670> want<00:05:59.850> to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
energy happens here so what we want to

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.450 
energy happens here so what we want to
do<00:06:00.090> is<00:06:00.360> overlap<00:06:01.170> so<00:06:01.560> that<00:06:01.710> we're<00:06:01.830> covering<00:06:02.250> all

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
do is overlap so that we're covering all

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.950 
do is overlap so that we're covering all
