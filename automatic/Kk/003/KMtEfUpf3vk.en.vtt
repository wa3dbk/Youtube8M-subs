00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
what the architect we're able to almost

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
what the architect we're able to almost
immediately<00:01:40.149> respond<00:01:40.719> within<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.229> few<00:01:41.439> hours

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
immediately respond within a few hours

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340 
immediately respond within a few hours
the<00:01:44.439> contractor<00:01:45.159> ultimately<00:01:46.350> understands

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the contractor ultimately understands

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.130 
the contractor ultimately understands
that<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:48.219> process<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> lot<00:01:49.329> faster<00:01:49.689> than<00:01:50.079> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
that this process is a lot faster than a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.270 
that this process is a lot faster than a
standard<00:01:50.920> email<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.579> there's<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.630> lot<00:01:52.869> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
standard email and there's a lot of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.800 
standard email and there's a lot of
documentation<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.520> goes<00:01:55.030> with<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.450> allow

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
documentation that goes with that allow

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.410 
documentation that goes with that allow
logs<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.710> are<00:01:56.859> produced<00:01:57.340> from<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:58.000> program

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
logs that are produced from the program

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.010 
logs that are produced from the program
so<00:01:59.109> overall<00:01:59.859> they're<00:02:00.310> able<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:01.000> use<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.810> more

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
so overall they're able to use it more

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.029 
so overall they're able to use it more
as<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.229> tool<00:02:02.380> than<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.920> than<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.999> hindrance<00:02:04.859> so<00:02:05.859> it

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
as a tool than a than a hindrance so it

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.070 
as a tool than a than a hindrance so it
helps<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.369> lot<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:06.909> process

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.410 

yeah<00:02:10.710> within<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> first<00:02:11.520> week<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.300> were

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
able to pick it up and run with it the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.910 
able to pick it up and run with it the
unlimited<00:02:15.210> users<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.280> set<00:02:17.790> price<00:02:18.170> was<00:02:19.170> the

unlimited users for a set price was the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.690 
unlimited users for a set price was the
best<00:02:20.850> selling<00:02:21.240> point<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.620> quick<00:02:22.950> startup

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
best selling point and the quick startup

best selling point and the quick startup
from<00:02:24.030> new<00:02:24.240> users<00:02:24.690> picking<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> program

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
from new users picking up the program

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.340 
from new users picking up the program
was<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> good<00:02:26.640> selling<00:02:27.000> point<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:30.780> were<00:02:30.930> able<00:02:31.110> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
was a good selling point we were able to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.010 
was a good selling point we were able to
generate<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.550> lot<00:02:32.880> more<00:02:33.650> specific<00:02:34.650> reports
