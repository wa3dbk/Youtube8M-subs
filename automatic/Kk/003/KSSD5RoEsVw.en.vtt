we do agility stuff and everything we do

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.219 
we do agility stuff and everything we do
because<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:32.119> kids<00:01:32.360> got<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.570> see<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.750> reason<00:01:33.020> why

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
because the kids got to see a reason why

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.050 
because the kids got to see a reason why
we<00:01:33.590> do<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.890> during<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.160> summer<00:01:34.430> they<00:01:34.790> got<00:01:34.820> to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
we do that during the summer they got to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.180 
we do that during the summer they got to
see<00:01:35.180> them<00:01:35.330> themselves<00:01:35.660> improve<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:37.070> way

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
see them themselves improve and that way

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.680 
see them themselves improve and that way
you<00:01:37.250> get<00:01:37.490> more<00:01:37.670> numbers<00:01:38.030> as<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.330> years<00:01:38.509> go<00:01:38.570> on

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
you get more numbers as the years go on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.359 
you get more numbers as the years go on
and<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.290> think<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:39.710> that's<00:01:40.009> kind<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
and I think that's that's kind of the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.280 
and I think that's that's kind of the
reason<00:01:40.520> we've<00:01:40.790> done<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:42.229> because
