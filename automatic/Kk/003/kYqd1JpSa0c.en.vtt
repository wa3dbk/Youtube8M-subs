00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
cigarettes at once prior to coming to my

00:00:27.240 --> 00:01:02.190 
cigarettes at once prior to coming to my
door

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.890 

boxing<00:01:03.200> level<00:01:04.300> asian<00:01:08.229> there<00:01:09.229> is<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.100> inside

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
boxing level asian there is the inside

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.540 
boxing level asian there is the inside
and<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.050> just<00:01:12.200> comes<00:01:12.440> packaged<00:01:12.950> like

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.360 

my<00:01:19.120> 50d<00:01:19.630> even<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.110> much<00:01:20.830> smaller<00:01:21.160> box<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:24.190> was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
my 50d even a much smaller box of it was

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:36.730 
my 50d even a much smaller box of it was
like<00:01:24.640> hats

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.590 

okay<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.800> there<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.400> unboxed<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:42.330> think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
okay so there it is unboxed and I think

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.360 
okay so there it is unboxed and I think
it's<00:01:42.720> already<00:01:43.020> assembled

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:03.999 

I<00:01:53.460> would<00:01:54.000> shine<00:01:54.180> on

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.199 

okay<00:02:05.009> here's<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.460> box<00:02:08.750> dual<00:02:09.750> link<00:02:10.019> DVI<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
okay here's the box dual link DVI and

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.070 
okay here's the box dual link DVI and
the<00:02:12.209> power<00:02:12.510> cord<00:02:12.930> nerve<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:15.540> rights<00:02:15.750> lives

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the power cord nerve all rights lives

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:29.200 
the power cord nerve all rights lives
back<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.730> pretty<00:02:18.000> stylin

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.290

you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.930> see<00:02:32.170> well<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.470> probably<00:02:32.650> can't<00:02:32.920> tell

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you can see well you probably can't tell

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.200 
you can see well you probably can't tell
from<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> video<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.310> classy

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.390 

and<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.260> pretty<00:02:40.500> nice<00:02:40.590> looking<00:02:43.280> all<00:02:44.280> right

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and it's pretty nice looking all right

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.960 
and it's pretty nice looking all right
just<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.820> know<00:02:46.190> when<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.430> want<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> put<00:02:47.880> in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
just so you know when you want to put in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.460 
just so you know when you want to put in
a<00:02:48.030> portrait<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.600> little<00:02:48.840> pink<00:02:49.050> comes<00:02:49.260> here

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
a portrait this little pink comes here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.930 
a portrait this little pink comes here
and<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> pull<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.980> out<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.310> slants<00:02:50.910> down

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and you pull it out and it slants down

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.920 
and you pull it out and it slants down
like<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:52.100> see<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> way<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.400> slanted

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
like that see the way it's slanted

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.270 
like that see the way it's slanted
whereas<00:02:55.220> originally<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.960> like<00:02:58.890> 90

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
whereas originally it's in like 90

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.010 
whereas originally it's in like 90
degrees<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.850> slants<00:03:00.240> down<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> keep

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
degrees so slants down you have to keep

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.260 
degrees so slants down you have to keep
turning<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:02.580> doesn't<00:03:02.760> come<00:03:03.000> all<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.240> way

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
turning it it doesn't come all the way

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.570 
turning it it doesn't come all the way
out<00:03:03.560> now<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.040> monitor<00:03:05.280> does<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:07.280> hi<00:03:08.280> just

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
out now the monitor does not hi just

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.200 
out now the monitor does not hi just
will<00:03:08.730> stand<00:03:09.000> does<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.480> go<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:09.840> high<00:03:10.050> enough<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
will stand does not go up high enough to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.370 
will stand does not go up high enough to
straight<00:03:12.210> out<00:03:12.330> rotate<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> actually

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
straight out rotate it so you actually

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:25.530 
straight out rotate it so you actually
have<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:15.290> tilt<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> screen<00:03:17.060> forward

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.619 

so<00:03:26.140> yeah<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.349> have<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.590> tilt<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:26.980> forward<00:03:27.629> like

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
so yeah you have to tilt it forward like

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.450 
so yeah you have to tilt it forward like
it<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.900> now<00:03:30.390> see

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
it is now see

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.340 
it is now see
and<00:03:32.580> then<00:03:33.180> push<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.170> like

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and then push it in and just like

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.040 
and then push it in and just like
everybody<00:03:34.590> else<00:03:34.800> mine<00:03:35.400> does<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.760> rotate<00:03:36.510> 90

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
everybody else mine does not rotate 90

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.810 
everybody else mine does not rotate 90
degrees<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.410> hard<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.590> show<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:41.670> by

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
degrees so it's hard to show just by

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.900 
degrees so it's hard to show just by
myself<00:03:42.000> oh<00:03:42.980> yeah<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:46.490> these<00:03:47.490> are<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
myself oh yeah so and these are the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.490 
myself oh yeah so and these are the
power<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.840> brightness<00:03:49.290> buttons<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.860> back

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
power and brightness buttons on the back

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.790 
power and brightness buttons on the back
I'm<00:03:52.500> at<00:03:52.650> cracking<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.220> was<00:03:53.340> my<00:03:53.490> foot
