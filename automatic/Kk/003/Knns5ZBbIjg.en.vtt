00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.989
 of course when the time was right 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.340
 it is seen however in spite of the shots to 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.930
 a certain moment on the penultimate climb 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.790
 I was about to skip every hour I came 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
 cramps 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.010

 face wind from how I saw that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 however they slowed down in front of them 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.200
 the 200 I know that if part 200 I can 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.780
 make a good sprint if I leave first or 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.320

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.330
