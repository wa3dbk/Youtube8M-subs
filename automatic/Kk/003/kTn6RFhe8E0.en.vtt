00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:04.320
 and it is the most recent that has been released 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.800
 and I do not know what else they are going to put us to say practicing open that more 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.379
 we have several things 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.669
 Although this one 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.349
 well this is a UFO achieves boom Scottish torist who by the way is watching us 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.470
 through the internet vll send a lot of greetings alain monnÃ© 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.989
 presented lists possesses 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 of visit in Spain 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.059
 this was just last month in September when you realize this 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.799
 object that saw it for 15 minutes and there are six that do not 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.989
 loosen for the camera this is another one of them very interesting given by juan 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.070
 carlos sure 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.900
 he works for a television station that ecuador 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.120
 they had the camera of the television station pointing towards the volcano 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.590
 the volcano was active 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 they have the camera when they see this group of divers passes over the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.550
 television the up the sustained decline 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.680
 accommodates the camera and is what it manages to record 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.630
 It is the tungurahua volcano in ecuador 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.690
 and it is that I find it very interesting to gisele the activity of the volcano and how 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.230
 up there are two other offerings that the project says a lot about 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.940
 Haitian during the launch of the sil stretch 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 some object crossed the cloud at a great speed 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 it was said that it was a table he speculated about this possibility 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.660
 but we good team accompanies with the engineer humberto villafuerte who 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.970
 spirit will have type 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 we did a more detailed analysis and found that it's about the shadows 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 in this case no object crossed the ninth 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.370
 I was traveling with the missile 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.010
 but that is the shadow of the east the reason of the missile projected on the cloud 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.680
 what it looks like, it was noticable because if we achieve it frame by frame we notice that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.330
 there is no object that crosses the right-left screen but rather 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.690
 the shadows begin to form in the center 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.120
 and the center is crossed to the sides 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.950
 and to finish we confirm this personal hypothesis 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.170
 we found another launching shot and where you can clearly see how it forms 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.950
 this shadow by the position of the PSOE by the question of the camera in Iraq 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.629
 and good if we achieve 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.299
 account perfectly 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.900
 that it was a shadow it was not a flying object that accompanied this 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900
 missile spike not all that bothered because it's very interesting when 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.629
 we found an explanation 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.989
 and especially when we share it with the clear public you always have to go to 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.599
 search for 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.829
 the explanation irak and we put more examples 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.849
 of shadows in the clouds yes as it is a phenomenon justice registered in 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.919
 various occasions 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.969
 what happens is that this had great relevance the missile because it does not 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.369
 they were commenting on the fox news 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:43.799
 when that image appears and well what many people from there to travel is the rumor 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:44.809
 the speculation
