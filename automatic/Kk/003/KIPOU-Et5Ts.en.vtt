00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
people have used do I like this lens

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.630 
people have used do I like this lens
better<00:01:47.060> actually<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.659> do<00:01:48.190> some<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.369> things

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
better actually I do some of the things

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.540 
better actually I do some of the things
that<00:01:49.940> were<00:01:50.119> problematic<00:01:50.930> with<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.320> 2405<00:01:52.310> is

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
that were problematic with the 2405 is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.310 
that were problematic with the 2405 is
that<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> corner<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.210> corner<00:01:53.390> sharpness<00:01:53.899> just

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
that the corner to corner sharpness just

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.919 
that the corner to corner sharpness just
wasn't<00:01:54.770> there<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.190> flare<00:01:55.880> control<00:01:56.390> wasn't<00:01:56.810> as

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
wasn't there the flare control wasn't as

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.990 
wasn't there the flare control wasn't as
good<00:01:57.080> as<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.320> would<00:01:57.470> have<00:01:57.530> liked<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:58.759> most

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
good as I would have liked it but most

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120 
good as I would have liked it but most
of<00:01:59.149> all<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.450> optical<00:01:59.869> quality<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.890> color

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
of all the optical quality the color

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.609 
of all the optical quality the color
saturation<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:02.119> sharpness<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.990> well

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
saturation the sharpness of it well

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.520 
saturation the sharpness of it well
somewhat<00:02:03.920> lacking<00:02:04.190> with<00:02:04.460> 105<00:02:05.149> dis<00:02:06.050> improves

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
somewhat lacking with 105 dis improves

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.529 
somewhat lacking with 105 dis improves
on<00:02:06.710> all<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.190> those<00:02:07.310> plus<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.060> gives<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.330> better

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
on all of those plus it gives you better

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.990 
on all of those plus it gives you better
image<00:02:08.929> stabilization<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.489> find<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
image stabilization and I find that the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.150 
image stabilization and I find that the
focusing<00:02:11.570> system<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:12.050> fast<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.530> well<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:12.950> oh

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
focusing system is fast as well so oh

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250 
focusing system is fast as well so oh
when<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.090> add<00:02:14.180> all<00:02:14.360> those<00:02:14.510> things<00:02:14.570> up<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.140> do

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
when you add all those things up I do

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.470 
when you add all those things up I do
like<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.860> lens<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.220> lot<00:02:16.370> better<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.390> I've

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
like this lens a lot better so I've

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
like this lens a lot better so I've
mentioned<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.989> image<00:02:18.200> stabilization<00:02:18.590> before

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
mentioned the image stabilization before

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.740 
mentioned the image stabilization before
and<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.730> why<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.060> such<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.269> big<00:02:20.540> deal

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and this is why it's such a big deal

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.600 
and this is why it's such a big deal
this<00:02:21.050> part<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.709> clip<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:22.100> recorded

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
this part of the clip was recorded

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.970 
this part of the clip was recorded
without<00:02:23.150> image<00:02:23.630> stabilization<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:24.860> you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
without image stabilization and here you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.850 
without image stabilization and here you
can<00:02:25.100> see<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:26.090> image<00:02:26.510> stabilization<00:02:26.860> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
can see with image stabilization it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.770 
can see with image stabilization it
makes<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.489> huge<00:02:28.910> difference<00:02:29.030> when<00:02:29.630> you're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
makes a huge difference when you're

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.120 
makes a huge difference when you're
hand-holding<00:02:30.380> account

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
hand-holding account

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.490 
hand-holding account
not<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.580> tripod<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.720> almost<00:02:33.110> impossible

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
not on a tripod it's almost impossible

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.610 
not on a tripod it's almost impossible
to<00:02:33.890> make<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> movie<00:02:34.760> while<00:02:35.090> you're<00:02:35.300> moving

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
to make a movie while you're moving

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.010 
to make a movie while you're moving
without<00:02:36.620> image<00:02:37.160> stabilization<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.180> that's<00:02:38.720> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
without image stabilization so that's a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.660 
without image stabilization so that's a
really<00:02:39.380> big<00:02:39.590> deal<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.130> lens<00:02:40.340> it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
really big deal with this lens it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.660 
really big deal with this lens it's
really<00:02:41.180> well<00:02:41.450> suited<00:02:41.750> for<00:02:41.960> video<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.550> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
really well suited for video one of the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.490 
really well suited for video one of the
pleasant<00:02:44.090> surprises<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.690> had<00:02:44.900> today<00:02:45.020> was<00:02:45.320> how

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
pleasant surprises I had today was how

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.440 
pleasant surprises I had today was how
much<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.040> liked<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.430> macro<00:02:46.820> mode<00:02:46.850> feature<00:02:47.270> on

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
much I liked the macro mode feature on

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.510 
much I liked the macro mode feature on
this<00:02:47.570> lens<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.020> what<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.320> do<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.770> you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
this lens so what you do is that you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.190 
this lens so what you do is that you
zoom<00:02:49.730> all<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:49.970> way<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.210> you<00:02:50.600> hit<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.930> little

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
zoom all the way out you hit it little

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.470 
zoom all the way out you hit it little
switching<00:02:51.650> he<00:02:51.800> come<00:02:52.010> soon<00:02:52.310> beyond<00:02:52.880> 270

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
switching he come soon beyond 270

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.720 
switching he come soon beyond 270
millimeter<00:02:53.900> mark<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:55.070> puts<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.460> in<00:02:55.580> a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
millimeter mark and that puts it in a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.690 
millimeter mark and that puts it in a
macro<00:02:56.270> mode<00:02:56.740> macro<00:02:57.740> mode<00:02:57.920> allows<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.520> take

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
macro mode macro mode allows you to take

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.450 
macro mode macro mode allows you to take
close-up<00:02:59.120> images<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.540> stuff<00:03:00.230> really<00:03:00.800> close<00:03:01.220> by

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
close-up images of stuff really close by

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.160 
close-up images of stuff really close by
to<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.060> fill<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.510> frame<00:03:02.720> with<00:03:02.960> tiny

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
to it and fill the frame with tiny

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.650 
to it and fill the frame with tiny
little<00:03:03.320> details<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.360> normally<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
little details and normally it's a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.500 
little details and normally it's a
choice<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:06.740> make<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> bring<00:03:08.480> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
choice you have to make do I bring a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.620 
choice you have to make do I bring a
macro<00:03:08.960> lens<00:03:09.170> or<00:03:09.380> my<00:03:09.530> extension<00:03:10.130> tubes<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.730> am

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
macro lens or my extension tubes and am

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.540 
macro lens or my extension tubes and am
I<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.140> do<00:03:12.230> macro<00:03:12.620> photography<00:03:12.800> today

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
I going to do macro photography today

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.980 
I going to do macro photography today
which<00:03:13.700> means<00:03:13.940> most<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.540> time<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
which means most of the time you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.570 
which means most of the time you
actually<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:15.860> bother<00:03:16.130> at<00:03:16.400> least

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
actually just don't bother at least

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.940 
actually just don't bother at least
that's<00:03:16.790> been<00:03:16.940> my<00:03:16.970> personal<00:03:17.540> experience<00:03:17.990> when

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
that's been my personal experience when

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.010 
that's been my personal experience when
you<00:03:19.070> have<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> macro<00:03:19.850> mode<00:03:20.030> feature<00:03:20.360> built<00:03:20.720> into

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
you have a macro mode feature built into

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.050 
you have a macro mode feature built into
the<00:03:21.110> lens<00:03:21.320> however<00:03:21.830> whenever<00:03:22.550> do<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:22.880> see

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the lens however whenever do you see

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000 
the lens however whenever do you see
something<00:03:23.450> interesting<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:24.530> flip<00:03:24.980> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
something interesting you just flip it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.710 
something interesting you just flip it
into<00:03:25.370> macro<00:03:25.760> mode<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.300> take<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
into macro mode and you take the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.390

fun playing with this lens today and I
have<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.290> say<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.770> am<00:03:37.010> impressed<00:03:37.340> by<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.640> the

have to say I am impressed by it the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.510 
have to say I am impressed by it the
optical<00:03:39.080> performance<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.740> good<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.280> color

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
optical performance is good the color

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.210 
optical performance is good the color
the<00:03:40.880> saturation<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.690> focusing<00:03:42.530> speed<00:03:42.860> the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
the saturation the focusing speed the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.880 
the saturation the focusing speed the
bokeh<00:03:43.700> quality<00:03:43.990> just<00:03:44.990> all<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.380> those<00:03:45.530> things

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
check out the macro ability is actually

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.710 
check out the macro ability is actually
more<00:03:49.100> from<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.520> I<00:03:49.550> expected<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.570> was

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
more from that I expected and I was

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.750 
more from that I expected and I was
impressed<00:03:51.020> by<00:03:51.170> how<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.530> held<00:03:51.740> up<00:03:51.890> when<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.550> was

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
impressed by how it held up when I was

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.670 
impressed by how it held up when I was
doing<00:03:52.880> things<00:03:53.360> like<00:03:53.480> panning<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.620> zooming

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
doing things like panning and zooming

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.390 
doing things like panning and zooming
and<00:03:55.540> low<00:03:56.540> shutter<00:03:56.930> speeds<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.590> lot<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:57.950> movement

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
and low shutter speeds a lot of movement

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.130 
and low shutter speeds a lot of movement
in<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:58.580> camera<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.570> was<00:03:59.720> holding<00:03:59.990> up

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
in the camera and I was holding up

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.660 
in the camera and I was holding up
really<00:04:00.410> well<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.860> image<00:04:01.070> stabilisation

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
really well and the image stabilisation

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.990 
really well and the image stabilisation
really<00:04:02.300> performed<00:04:02.810> better<00:04:03.020> than<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.440> hope<00:04:03.650> for

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
really performed better than I hope for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.340 
really performed better than I hope for
it<00:04:05.000> performed<00:04:05.450> really<00:04:05.600> well<00:04:05.690> when<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.230> was

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
it performed really well when I was

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.680 
it performed really well when I was
doing<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.800> horrible<00:04:07.340> thing<00:04:07.550> like<00:04:07.690> walking

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
doing a horrible thing like walking

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.350 
doing a horrible thing like walking
while<00:04:09.350> haddon<00:04:09.680> holding<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.100> camera<00:04:10.370> something

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
while haddon holding a camera something

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.790 
while haddon holding a camera something
that<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.750> shouldn't<00:04:12.080> do<00:04:12.320> if<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.590> want<00:04:12.770> to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
that you shouldn't do if you want to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.890 
that you shouldn't do if you want to
make<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:12.980> professional<00:04:13.580> quality<00:04:13.970> movie<00:04:14.330> but<00:04:14.810> it

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
make a professional quality movie but it

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.690 
make a professional quality movie but it
really<00:04:15.080> tortured<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.800> system<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.400> have<00:04:16.549> to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
really tortured the system and I have to

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.760 
really tortured the system and I have to
admit<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.390> did<00:04:17.690> straighten<00:04:18.260> out<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.440> whole

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
admit it it did straighten out a whole

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.400 
admit it it did straighten out a whole
bunch<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.820> effect<00:04:20.210> of<00:04:20.390> moving<00:04:20.720> around<00:04:21.080> and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
bunch of the effect of moving around and

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.900 
bunch of the effect of moving around and
hand<00:04:21.560> holding<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:21.980> camera<00:04:22.190> while<00:04:22.490> making<00:04:22.520> a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
hand holding a camera while making a

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.380
