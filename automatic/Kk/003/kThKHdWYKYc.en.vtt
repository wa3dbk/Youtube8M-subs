00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.870 
teach you how to create the perfect cat
eye<00:00:15.509> using<00:00:16.200> master<00:00:16.680> precise<00:00:17.010> liquid<00:00:17.430> ink<00:00:17.609> pen

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
eye using master precise liquid ink pen

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
eye using master precise liquid ink pen
eyeliner<00:00:18.359> liquid<00:00:19.230> liners<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:19.949> difficult

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
eyeliner liquid liners can be difficult

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580 
eyeliner liquid liners can be difficult
to<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.640> however<00:00:21.300> master<00:00:21.750> precise<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to use however master precise is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.470 
to use however master precise is
actually<00:00:23.010> quite<00:00:23.220> easy<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.060> felt<00:00:24.300> tip

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
actually quite easy because the felt tip

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
actually quite easy because the felt tip
is<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.930> thin<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.560> allows<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.310> extreme

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
is so thin it allows for extreme

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.599 
is so thin it allows for extreme
precision<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:28.800> gonna<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> cat<00:00:29.580> eye

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
precision so we're gonna do a cat eye

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
precision so we're gonna do a cat eye
but<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.330> add<00:00:30.570> an<00:00:30.750> unexpected<00:00:31.619> twist<00:00:31.800> at

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
but I'm gonna add an unexpected twist at

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.070 
but I'm gonna add an unexpected twist at
the<00:00:32.189> end<00:00:32.310> first<00:00:33.240> you<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> start<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
the end first you want to start with the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.840 
the end first you want to start with the
inner<00:00:34.230> corner<00:00:34.650> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.890> eye<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.310> you<00:00:35.580> want

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
inner corner of the eye and you want

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.880 
inner corner of the eye and you want
this<00:00:36.030> line<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.080> thinnest<00:00:37.500> line<00:00:37.740> as

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this line to be the thinnest line as

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
this line to be the thinnest line as
possible<00:00:38.130> so<00:00:38.880> you're<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.180> angle<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> pen

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
possible so you're gonna angle the pen

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
possible so you're gonna angle the pen
and<00:00:40.140> lightly<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:42.210> thin<00:00:42.480> line<00:00:42.990> I<00:00:46.640> like

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and lightly do a really thin line I like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.720 
and lightly do a really thin line I like
to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.150> liner<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.870> straight<00:00:49.320> across

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
to do the liner going straight across

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.210 
to do the liner going straight across
using<00:00:50.730> short<00:00:51.090> feathering<00:00:51.540> strokes<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.980> do

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
using short feathering strokes if you do

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.580 
using short feathering strokes if you do
one<00:00:53.460> big<00:00:53.670> swoop<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.960> easier<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.380> make

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
one big swoop it's a lot easier to make

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.730 
one big swoop it's a lot easier to make
a<00:00:55.650> mistake<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.450> tail

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
a mistake now when you get to the tail

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.040 
a mistake now when you get to the tail
I'm<00:00:58.740> just<00:00:58.950> gonna<00:00:59.130> draw<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> flick<00:01:00.240> it<00:01:00.360> out<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I'm just gonna draw and flick it out and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.340 
I'm just gonna draw and flick it out and
this<00:01:01.950> can<00:01:02.220> be<00:01:02.600> super<00:01:03.600> long<00:01:03.810> and<00:01:03.870> super

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this can be super long and super

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
this can be super long and super
dramatic<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.760> whatever<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.390> want

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
dramatic you could do whatever you want

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.220 
dramatic you could do whatever you want
with<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.110> make

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
with it now what I'm gonna do to make

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.430 
with it now what I'm gonna do to make
this<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:11.280> interesting<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.630> I'm

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
this a little more interesting is I'm

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.800 
this a little more interesting is I'm
going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> pen<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> draw<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.540> little

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going to take the pen and draw a little

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.150 
going to take the pen and draw a little
line<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.500> tail<00:01:16.770> duct<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.560> really

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
line by the tail duct this is really

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.550 
line by the tail duct this is really
easy<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.480> pen<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.110> makes<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
easy to do with this pen it makes it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.790 
easy to do with this pen it makes it
virtually<00:01:22.800> mistake<00:01:23.610> proof<00:01:24.260> because<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.470> tip

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
virtually mistake proof because the tip

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.470 
virtually mistake proof because the tip
is<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.940> perfectly<00:01:27.710> pointy<00:01:28.850> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.240> get

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
is so perfectly pointy that you can get

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.630 
is so perfectly pointy that you can get
a<00:01:30.720> perfect<00:01:31.140> edge

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.120 

so<00:01:37.390> I'm<00:01:37.450> going<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.750> connect<00:01:38.110> this<00:01:38.260> line<00:01:38.320> using

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
so I'm going to connect this line using

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:52.989 
so I'm going to connect this line using
short<00:01:39.460> strokes

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.520 

to<00:01:53.999> complement<00:01:54.569> this<00:01:54.689> look<00:01:54.929> I'm<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.350> use

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to complement this look I'm gonna use

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.919 
to complement this look I'm gonna use
illegal<00:01:55.920> links<00:01:56.310> mascara<00:01:56.819> to<00:01:57.210> complete<00:01:57.689> this

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
illegal links mascara to complete this

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:06.800 
illegal links mascara to complete this
dramatic<00:01:58.649> cat<00:01:58.979> eye<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:05.240> that's<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.539> do<00:02:06.780> a
