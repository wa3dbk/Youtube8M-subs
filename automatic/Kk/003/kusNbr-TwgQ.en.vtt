to bake the cupcakes normally at 350 you

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:16.829 
to bake the cupcakes normally at 350 you
just<00:06:15.999> want<00:06:16.119> to<00:06:16.149> make<00:06:16.300> sure<00:06:16.330> you're<00:06:16.629> checking

just want to make sure you're checking

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.769 
just want to make sure you're checking
on<00:06:17.229> them<00:06:17.520> at<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.699> about<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:18.999> 18<00:06:19.330> minute<00:06:19.599> mark

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.260 
on them at the about the 18 minute mark
to<00:06:19.959> make<00:06:20.110> sure<00:06:20.349> that<00:06:20.619> they<00:06:21.339> aren't<00:06:21.669> going<00:06:22.149> to

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
to make sure that they aren't going to

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.689 
to make sure that they aren't going to
be<00:06:22.930> overcooked<00:06:23.499> so<00:06:24.099> I'm<00:06:24.219> going<00:06:24.369> to<00:06:24.399> put<00:06:24.580> these
