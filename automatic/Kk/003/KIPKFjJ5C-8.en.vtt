00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.210
 far to the east beyond saws 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.370
 and rivers there is a lonely mountain 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.790
 Dwarves are determined to recover their 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.790
 land 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.290
 I like all visits as 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 but I prefer to be notified before 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.050
 come and see me, sir, your pocket 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.220
 service I'm not surrounded by dwarfs that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.230
 they do here but suso died god's law 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 so this is the hobby you asked me 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 who found the fourteenth member 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.470
 of the group I have chosen Mr. Bag 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.690
 that I do not hobbits pass 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.390
 unnoticed and already proposed and that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.620
 gives us a great advantage will be 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.250
 our chance to recover 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.250
 Mr. Bag 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.940
 an adventure 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.970
 my big because the medium because 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 bilbo bag 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.290
 maybe because I'm afraid 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.290
 and he gives me courage 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.640
 that's what you get into the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.740
 mountain and because there are no people who do not 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 they would consider sensible 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.090
 a dark power has found a way 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.299
 to return to the world 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 because we did not play the riddles 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.670
 misses 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.560
 so what good if I lose if the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.290
 eat more will leave me 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.130
 and I go they are loses I did eat whole 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 in agreement 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.950
 would count on each and every one of these 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.950
 Dwarves for the best army 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.820
 loyalty honor a heart will stub 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.820
 What more could you want 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.880
 you have left your home behind 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.880
 wait for you 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.170
 it could have been worse
