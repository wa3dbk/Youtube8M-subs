00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.689
 Only Hello erotic is in the direction of 6 inn 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:12.310
 As I could not go to the rain for the seminar 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:19.210
 I hope to use videos to send out various information 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:21.700
 Among the So began what was've seen me is dark color products in the fact that various patrol boats of President cram 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.380
 If this is introduced to you 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:34.230
 I would like to introduce something useful, but it is a departure. 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 That the guitar new lens for beginners the first installment is to say whether to introduce what Well 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:56.310
 I do not hit the image that Buber knows here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.400
 I think if you know or not know the other person of Nejiko teacher 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.170
 Because imperial loose completion is written like this 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.920
 Comparable reading 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.030
 However , the content is not necessarily thin for this small and thin book 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.159
 Because it is written quite firmly guess is that necessary 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.159
 It's a kind of blood, but I don't feel like it's easy, but when I read it all 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.790
 This is a lecturer that you can study to a detailed place 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:29.940
 Recommend is recommended point of number one of this book is to enter the pocket 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.940
 It is a rather common story, but it is a common story 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:41.070
 What is the benefit of being detailed in the pocket 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.760
 For example, I have studied new lenses, so it's time to see the waveform in 8 buildings . 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.750
 There is actually a waveform that I do not understand well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.890
 It is this person in the name 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.430
 Being from the pocket and the staff and for example myself 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.520
 Put it and I thought premature ventricular contraction 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:06.940
 There is a waveform there. Check this book and find out that the new century is really a ladder. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.130
 Then, it must be true that this is a new century and a half contraction because this meets this definition 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.880
 It can be confirmed as it would be 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.940
 I will test to study at school 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:25.130
 At the same to sue that has been studied in but I was the same myself confirm it immediately in the clinical 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:30.120
 If you can do that, you can be confident that you can do this 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.319
 Well this is when I put it in my pocket and look at the new raise 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.510
 It 's okay to say that I think the water will be a really strong level 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.430
 But it was this book encouragement 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 So anyone who wants to now study it a new raise is to here 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.610
 It is clear enough to say that this book is enough for now 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.829
 A good way is though you have unusual story there is an expert 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.829
 General of thanks because this is enough I think that if it is possible to study Well It is by all means in this
