00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.010
 so just now we reeled perfectly 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.639
 new old man on the coil 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.920
 but it seemed to me that at the very end 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
 our winding procedure is somewhere in between 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.529
 in batches slipped by some people 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.080
 spring that needs to be fixed sometimes 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 so much when something is rubbing on it 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.969
 such a spring rolls up 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 which may later from which 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.110
 later a lamb may be formed 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.129
 Well, this is already fishing will lead to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.969
 shooting tackle 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.610
 to break the gear and do not want to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.149
 so on new on freshly wound 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.770
 so many 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 there were any defects like this 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.109
 The moment we now show how to align 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 steel q 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.969
 remove from the ratchet to do here tyazhechko 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.680
 with the help of this screw and go 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.189
 let's try to find our defect here 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.860
 we shake slowly 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.590
 we look at steel q visually and between 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 fingers we will feel it if 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.689
 it seemed to me again so so so 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 so far everything is going well new little bit 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:35.939
 even here and here it is white such 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.619
 Here I barely perceptible spring which 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.759
 strives still curl lamb 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.799
 so we will need a wand from listen 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.200
 spinning we firmly somewhere must 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.049
 fix well for example in the battery nothing 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.070
 scary here it is a stick for sushi 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.009
 we pass our coil and now 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.189
 we are under good tension here 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.360
 this one is a slightly defective area we 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.310
 take two coins preferably smooth 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.649
 shiny new 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.170
 I like it when they are there 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.569
 here is a completely new 25 penny 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.390
 for example, we make coins light 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.349
 stretch tables 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.690
 between two coils and lightly holding 100 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:31.200
 lichku between coins stretch 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:40.410
 here and there we relax look at the defect almost 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:45.600
 eliminated again and again 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.030
 just add our site can 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.700
 leave as is, but I want everything 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 so that we have a new motor 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:09.590
 absolutely new like this 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.590
 a little bit 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:21.680
 all can now continue to wind 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.680
 take out our wand with better and 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 continue here is another which is 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.250
 incomprehensible bend chick formed between 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.980
 so on fishing such tweezers 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.519
 possible if something passes the delivery 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 so here they are eliminated 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:58.940
 and never happened to take out our 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.940
 wand continue winding 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.680
 still went perfectly smooth so much 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.370
 here is such a small defect tag a 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.940
 fishing it may not happen at all 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.060
 small we eliminate with 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.360
 talc tension between two coils and 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.490
 using two desirable new 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.490
 smooth coins all
