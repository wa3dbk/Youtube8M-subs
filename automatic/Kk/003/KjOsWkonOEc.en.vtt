00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
the lights at appear we shot this on the
street<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> left<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> life<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
street and left to that life was a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
street and left to that life was a
little<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> white<00:01:41.390> gate<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.689> some

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
little bit of a white gate or some

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
little bit of a white gate or some
island<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.799> whatever<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.329> actually

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
island or whatever and that was actually

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
island or whatever and that was actually
easy<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.320> turn<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.799> lights<00:01:47.009> shoot

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
easy to just turn the lights shoot

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
easy to just turn the lights shoot
against<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.390> white<00:01:48.630> it's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
against that and because it's white it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
against that and because it's white it's
also<00:01:49.020> reflecting<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.979> nicely<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.060> again

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
also reflecting really nicely so again

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
also reflecting really nicely so again
and<00:01:51.600> shot<00:01:51.869> too<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.530> guys<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:52.979> right

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and shot too as you guys can see right

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.330 
and shot too as you guys can see right
now<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.680> turn<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.159> light

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
now you will see that we turn the light

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.149 
now you will see that we turn the light
away<00:01:56.750> just<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> wall<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.710> would

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
away just into the wall that would

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
away just into the wall that would
balance<00:01:59.430> obviously<00:02:00.000> back<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> white

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
balance obviously back into that white

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.649 
balance obviously back into that white
wall<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.590> give<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.610> model<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.450> nice

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
wall and give the model a really nice

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.899 
wall and give the model a really nice
softer

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
softer

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.520 
softer
night<00:02:05.210> which<00:02:05.509> would<00:02:05.719> actually<00:02:06.049> look<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.409> little

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
night which would actually look a little

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.889 
night which would actually look a little
bit<00:02:06.679> better<00:02:06.829> instead<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.640> super<00:02:08.239> hard

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
bit better instead of that super hard

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.410 
bit better instead of that super hard
one<00:02:09.170> as<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.160> guys<00:02:10.310> can<00:02:10.550> look<00:02:10.729> at<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> first

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
one as if you guys can look at the first

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.559 
one as if you guys can look at the first
one<00:02:11.660> again<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.500> that's<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:12.800> too<00:02:13.340> hard<00:02:13.790> so

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
one again so that's just too hard so

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.300 
one again so that's just too hard so
okay<00:02:14.840> great<00:02:15.110> i<00:02:15.140> had<00:02:15.379> really<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.769> first<00:02:15.950> light

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
okay great i had really the first light

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
okay great i had really the first light
and<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:16.640> as<00:02:17.150> well<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.690> second<00:02:18.170> light<00:02:18.290> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then as well the second light is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.380 
and then as well the second light is
well<00:02:18.650> from<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.069> front<00:02:19.310> pretty<00:02:19.730> close<00:02:20.090> in

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
well from the front pretty close in

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.190 
well from the front pretty close in
again<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> beauty<00:02:21.650> dish<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.790> grid<00:02:23.180> placing<00:02:24.080> it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
again a beauty dish with grid placing it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.559 
again a beauty dish with grid placing it
pretty<00:02:25.010> far<00:02:25.400> most<00:02:25.760> probably<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
pretty far most probably just like a

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.479 
pretty far most probably just like a
meter<00:02:26.989> we're<00:02:27.379> not<00:02:27.560> even<00:02:27.680> more<00:02:28.040> than<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> meter

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
meter we're not even more than a meter

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.270 
meter we're not even more than a meter
literally<00:02:29.360> very<00:02:29.720> close<00:02:30.110> again<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.650> medium

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
literally very close again on medium

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.820 
literally very close again on medium
power<00:02:31.549> as<00:02:31.910> well<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:33.230> were<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.440> first<00:02:33.709> of

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
power as well which were the first of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.380 
power as well which were the first of
all<00:02:33.950> obviously<00:02:34.099> target<00:02:34.819> again<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.209> light

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
all obviously target again the light

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.600 
all obviously target again the light
just<00:02:35.599> on<00:02:35.810> him<00:02:35.989> narrow<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.769> little<00:02:37.040> bit<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
just on him narrow a little bit down and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
just on him narrow a little bit down and
I<00:02:38.090> idea<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.540> obviously<00:02:38.840> because<00:02:39.079> this<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.379> the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
I idea was obviously because this is the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.920 
I idea was obviously because this is the
Instagram<00:02:40.010> pro<00:02:40.280> tutorial<00:02:40.819> keeping<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.750> guy

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.770 
the center so then again in post comping
all<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.400> together<00:04:52.580> work<00:04:53.030> pretty<00:04:53.270> well<00:04:53.360> as

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
all that together work pretty well as

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140 
all that together work pretty well as
well<00:04:54.320> my<00:04:54.500> idea<00:04:54.800> for<00:04:54.830> this<00:04:55.100> whole<00:04:55.340> idea<00:04:55.910> was

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
well my idea for this whole idea was

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.090 
well my idea for this whole idea was
also<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.690> background<00:04:57.170> has<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.710> be<00:04:57.890> at<00:04:58.010> the

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
also the background has to be at the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.280 
also the background has to be at the
back<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.670> background<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.720> needs<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.140> be

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
back of the background it needs to be

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.990
