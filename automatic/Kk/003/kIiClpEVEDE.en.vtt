00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
view of the sword sector he doesn't

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
view of the sword sector he doesn't
transform<00:00:27.300> again<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> belt<00:00:28.109> he<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.349> his

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
sword and this is obviously a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
sword and this is obviously a
ridiculously<00:00:31.260> short<00:00:31.380> version<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> his<00:00:32.189> sword

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
ridiculously short version of his sword

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.049 
ridiculously short version of his sword
I<00:00:32.610> saw<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.480> eBay<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.230> auctioning<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
I saw on eBay so he was auctioning a

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
I saw on eBay so he was auctioning a
replacement<00:00:36.059> blade<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
replacement blade for this that you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
replacement blade for this that you
could<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.010> unscrew<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.489> part<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> put<00:00:39.059> on

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
could just unscrew this part and put on

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
could just unscrew this part and put on
a<00:00:39.180> new<00:00:39.360> longer<00:00:39.660> longer<00:00:40.620> blade<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.129> it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
a new longer longer blade to make it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
a new longer longer blade to make it
look<00:00:41.370> more<00:00:41.520> show<00:00:41.700> accurate<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.170> were

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
look more show accurate but they were

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
look more show accurate but they were
only<00:00:43.440> selling<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.399> sector<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
only selling it with the sector and I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.819 
only selling it with the sector and I
already<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> sector<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
already had the sector on the way so I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
already had the sector on the way so I
wasn't<00:00:47.100> gonna<00:00:47.190> pay<00:00:47.430> another<00:00:48.289> crazily<00:00:49.289> amount

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
wasn't gonna pay another crazily amount

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
wasn't gonna pay another crazily amount
for<00:00:50.030> another<00:00:51.030> sector<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> sword<00:00:51.989> handle

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
for another sector and the sword handle

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
for another sector and the sword handle
or<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> sword<00:00:53.190> extension<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> anyway<00:00:54.960> this

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
or the sword extension but anyway this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.569 
or the sword extension but anyway this
is<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> sector<00:00:55.860> itself<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.430> there's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
is this is the sector itself and there's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.569 
is this is the sector itself and there's
a<00:00:56.670> switch<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> turn<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.460> makes

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a switch here to turn it on and it makes

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420 
a switch here to turn it on and it makes
the<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> standard<00:01:00.949> powerup<00:01:01.949> noise<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the just the standard powerup noise and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.020 
the just the standard powerup noise and
then<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.769> pull<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.979> trigger<00:01:05.100> it'll<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
then you pull the trigger it'll make the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.100 
then you pull the trigger it'll make the
standby<00:01:06.570> noise<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> basically<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.840> waiting

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
standby noise and basically it's waiting

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
standby noise and basically it's waiting
for<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> Scorpion<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> the

for the Scorpion to come here and the
Scorpion<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.689> snaps<00:01:16.350> right<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
Scorpion just snaps right on there and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
Scorpion just snaps right on there and
it<00:01:20.850> makes<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> henshin<00:01:21.479> noise<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> while

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it makes the henshin noise and while

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
it makes the henshin noise and while
this<00:01:23.220> wats<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> mode<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.180> pull<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
this wats in this mode you can pull the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.550 
this wats in this mode you can pull the
trigger<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:24.990> sword<00:01:25.259> noises<00:01:28.640> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
trigger and make some sword noises and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
trigger and make some sword noises and
then<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> cast<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.549> slap<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then to cast off you just slap the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.310 
then to cast off you just slap the
Scorpion<00:01:33.780> tail<00:01:33.930> down

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.690 

Chane<00:01:43.320> scorpion<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> after<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.430> it'll<00:01:44.580> make

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
Chane scorpion and after that it'll make

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
Chane scorpion and after that it'll make
some<00:01:44.850> different<00:01:45.150> sore<00:01:45.299> noses<00:01:50.270> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
some different sore noses like that and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
some different sore noses like that and
then<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.720> slash<00:01:55.050> again

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
then you can do right or slash again

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:09.759 
then you can do right or slash again
just<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:55.680> reactivating<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.340> tail<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.790> just

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.070 

and<00:02:10.769> then<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.519> there<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.080> so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and then that's all there is to that so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.910 
and then that's all there is to that so
that's<00:02:13.350> pretty<00:02:13.470> much<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that's pretty much it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.060 
that's pretty much it
it<00:02:14.250> goes<00:02:14.750> back<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.930> making<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.620> sword

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it goes back to making little sword

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.979 
it goes back to making little sword
noises<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.540> squeeze<00:02:18.780> these<00:02:18.930> two

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
noises then you just squeeze these two

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.229 
noises then you just squeeze these two
buttons<00:02:19.320> right<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> scorpion<00:02:21.030> pops

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
buttons right here and the scorpion pops
