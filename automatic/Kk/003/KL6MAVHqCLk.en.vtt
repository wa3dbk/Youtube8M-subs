00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 the amazon water eyes project 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.450
 our waters keep our rivers and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.190
 prioritizing lives 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 the honey production chain is being 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 promoted by the municipal government of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.619
 high forest through the secretary 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
 municipal government with support from the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.189
 the Amazon basin, which is the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 funder of the project 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 amazon are being cultivated beehive 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 of stingless bees from the Amazon until 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.050
 later this year the site will have 300 beehives 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.840
 to be started on the first 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 quarter of 2015 the distribution to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 farmers interested 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 the production process consists of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 partial withdrawal of the disc creates jobs 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 and Sermin of the motherboard 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.899
 the parts removed from the parent 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 are placed in a new carton 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.309
 from there will be created a new one with 6 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.890
 named daughter colony this new 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.629
 how to receive artificial feeding 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 so that it can develop is also 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 the entire carton has been sealed 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.399
 rational to avoid the attack of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 natural enemies 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.829
 the millionaire question exists within the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 amazon water eyes project she comes 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.049
 with the focus on bees 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 installed in the restoration areas. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.950
 areas of restoration areas of liabilities 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 within the properties 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 rural areas that are now regularized by 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.600
 through the rural environmental registration 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.090
 the focus is what is focusing on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.810
 environmental issue by ensuring that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.299
 biodiversity regarding the flora then 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.790
 I have a very great relationship between 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.369
 bees and plant species or by 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.979
 according to the agents responsible for 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.040
 pollination then placing it in the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.920
 app so many areas working pa 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.869
 maintaining the biodiversity of flora and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 is also giving a financial return 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.000
 for the farmer with the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.159
 this initiative 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 developed by the water eyes project 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 of the Amazon is strategic in the sense 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.590
 accelerate the process of recovery of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 springs and riverbanks 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.310
 because bees are agents 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.380
 pollinators besides offering an option 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 to rural producers 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 it punishes culture within the eye project 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.270
 of water in the Amazon, it represents a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.950
 conservation strategy in the sense of 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.410
 believe in promoting this 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.100
 distributing bees directly to the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.570
 producer 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.880
 then recovering the two 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.830
 short hill patients have more 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.740
 a strategy that strengthens this 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.410
 recovery of the first day the 181 is something 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.390
 more that comes to add so much to some 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.670
 environmental component that the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.770
 of the jotinha course of hill and that is a 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.430
 thing that the producer often has 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.160
 these bees are stingless like a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.630
 grip on the porch of your house and 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.370
 people brings a context of 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.500
 spring recovery and for one 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 content of consumption possibility 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.690
 improvement of its food menu and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.490
 possibility of future 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.070
 establish a culture of bees 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.090
 in the municipality and be able to market honey 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.590
 of these bees 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 Secretary of high ambient medium 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.760
 forest speaks of this joint work 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.710
 city ​​hall and rural producers 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 this second phase of the project in the eyes 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.640
 we then continue with the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.340
 recovery, right? 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 the result of this pps-pe the watercourse 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 and in return we offer the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.980
 producer, but this part because 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.580
 help him financially with the donation 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.460
 in these bees for this comedy that 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230
 He has more financial aid than she 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.270
 remembers that through the city hall the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 municipality shows to be a pioneer in 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.470
 encourage the cultivation of meliponicultura 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.290
 It's an innovation, huh ? 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.070
 offering is here in the region is first 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.930
 the city hall offering this innovation 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.250
 is not for the producer and will start to 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.950
 make this distribution at the beginning of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.230
 2012 and 2015 and that the producer wants to see 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.230
 really benefited high city hall 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.530
 forest working gift 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.530
 building the future
