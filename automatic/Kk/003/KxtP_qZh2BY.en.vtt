00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.630
 Yes is very much Hello or subtitle and or will you can see when you see the title today 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.750
 I think 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.750
 The number of subtitle subscribers has exceeded 1,000 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.759
 I have not been able to make a video of thanks and my feelings into video because the timing has not been matched so far 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 But 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.550
 This time the city ​​abduction that I do not work last night in an attempt to get a shot of the numbers of the absolute just line 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550
 I checked it 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 But this I'm really glad that our story had become from 999 people to 1001 people in the next moment 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.970
 I was not able to shoot the perfect skusho why, but I really surprised myself

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.990

 Even though you may not know is who was recently you registered 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.400
 In my case I like digital mono gadgets but I'm not even more detailed 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.050
 is 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.180
 Or gotten advice from everyone in the comments each time you worried about or lost or rather 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.630
 Video progresses while also Attari 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.009
 Failure Video There are also a lot just how we learn from the failure also to all videos 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 I want to go there, so there may be many things that are not helpful 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.659
 I would be glad if you could watch over it with warm eyes 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.460
 I would like to continue making videos of what I can buy within the scope of my pocket money 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.720
 Thank you in advance 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.369
 That's where I want to finish today with full of gratitude 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.090
 There is something that I have to talk to me in recent trends 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:46.369
 Plala Mobile lte I have been using for two weeks 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.659
 It is a plan of communication unlimited of maximum speed 3 mbps limit 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.450
 There is a report 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 Actually, gradually 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.369
 I could see a glimpse of slowing down due to radio wave congestion but 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.759
 Has become as caught on youtube play 360 p from yesterday 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.729
 So I tried a speed test every day with yesterday but I also 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.729
 Occasionally you can see 1 mbps off 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.950
 When I look at the average, I can see about 1.5 eyes, but the speed required for my original application 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.450
 It means that it has fallen to the last line 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.380
 You have no choice but to go back to youtube play 240 votes when it falls 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.880
 It will be quite stressful situation 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.750
 However , according to the four interview articles, just because it is a fixed price 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.880
 Or 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 The available bandwidth is available with ample margin, and the bandwidth will continue to see demand 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.600
 It was written that it increased 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.470
 Is I think the story that is knowledge that does not hold as the all-you-can-eat metatarsal plan of not 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.370
 Was 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.650
 Why the site is concentrated on contracts 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:00.180
 I believe it is a temporary traffic jam and I want to see it for a while 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.159
 Also come and that those who are becomes to users from 100 200 gb used 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:09.989
 Although in segregation of this area and I feel also I think we need a little more fragmented 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.360
 I think the importance or importance of what this plan has started is great . 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.980
 Well 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.330
 I would like to support it unless the bad situation continues 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.760
