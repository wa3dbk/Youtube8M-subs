I be refine cases come in two
configurations<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:07.610> attachment<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.300> first

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
configurations for attachment the first

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.470 
configurations for attachment the first
one<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.870> stem<00:01:09.200> clamp<00:01:09.500> with<00:01:10.370> its<00:01:10.580> 2-bike<00:01:11.120> stem

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
one is a stem clamp with its 2-bike stem

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.350 
one is a stem clamp with its 2-bike stem
and<00:01:11.950> as<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.010> quick<00:01:13.250> attachment<00:01:13.820> release<00:01:14.090> like

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
handlebars because the iberia case is

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.830
