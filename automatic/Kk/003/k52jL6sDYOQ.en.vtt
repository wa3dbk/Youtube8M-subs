00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
waterproof eyeliner pens because they

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.620 
waterproof eyeliner pens because they
are<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.689> thin<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.670> it<00:00:23.670> takes<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.269> 10

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

seconds to do your eyeliner because you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 
seconds to do your eyeliner because you

just do one line across and they're
super<00:00:28.769> thin<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.460> hard<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> mess

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
super thin so it's really hard to mess

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
opened yet I'm wearing the black one
today<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.620> sure<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.160> tell<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.809> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
today I'm not sure if you can tell but I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380 
today I'm not sure if you can tell but I
used<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.620> aqua<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.670> forgot<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
used to have one in aqua but I forgot to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
used to have one in aqua but I forgot to
put<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> cap<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> dried<00:00:52.890> out

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
put the cap on and then it dried out

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
put the cap on and then it dried out
because<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> cap<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.480> hard<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:54.960> on

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
because the cap is really hard to put on

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
because the cap is really hard to put on
actually<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
actually because you think you have it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.779 
actually because you think you have it
on<00:00:57.289> what<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.500> wrong<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
on what is wrong but then you have to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
on what is wrong but then you have to
really<00:01:00.090> press<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.890> snaps

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
really press down on it so it like snaps

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
really press down on it so it like snaps
so<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> only<00:01:03.390> problem<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.049> these

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so that's the only problem with these

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
so that's the only problem with these
sometimes<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.799> dry<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> sometimes<00:01:05.700> elf

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sometimes they dry out and sometimes elf

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
sometimes they dry out and sometimes elf
is<00:01:06.420> weird<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> you'll<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.860> it's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is weird and you'll get it and it's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
is weird and you'll get it and it's
already<00:01:08.369> dried<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.060> these<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.689> only<00:01:09.780> one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
already dried out but these are only one

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
already dried out but these are only one

sheer<00:02:26.570> claims<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.740> will<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
sheer claims that it will be a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120 
sheer claims that it will be a
long-lasting<00:02:29.330> finish<00:02:29.960> mat<00:02:30.380> coverage<00:02:30.830> with

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
natural minerals in the shine control so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.990 
natural minerals in the shine control so
I<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.070> really<00:02:34.340> good<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.760> I've

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
I think this is really good because I've

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.580 
I think this is really good because I've
been<00:02:35.150> getting<00:02:35.390> shiny<00:02:35.690> especially<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.470> my

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
been getting shiny especially on my

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.560 
been getting shiny especially on my
forehead<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.910> summer<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.300> it's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
forehead because it is summer and it's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.540 
forehead because it is summer and it's
really<00:02:38.810> hot<00:02:39.020> out<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.350> my<00:02:39.500> mac<00:02:39.770> powder<00:02:40.130> isn't

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
really hot out on my mac powder isn't

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.650 
really hot out on my mac powder isn't
doing<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.030> great<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.110> job<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:42.830> absorbing

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
doing that great of a job like absorbing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.480 
doing that great of a job like absorbing
oil<00:02:44.660> daya<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.650> thought<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.070> would<00:02:46.130> do<00:02:46.460> a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
oil daya so I thought this would do a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.880 
oil daya so I thought this would do a
better<00:02:46.910> job<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:47.990> plus<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.680> lot

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
better job with it plus it's a lot

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.040 
better job with it plus it's a lot
cheaper<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.730> cousin<00:02:50.120> uses<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.930> she

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
cheaper and my cousin uses this and she

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.000 
cheaper and my cousin uses this and she
said<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.380> compares<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> mac<00:02:52.940> powder<00:02:53.300> so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
said it compares to the mac powder so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.830 
said it compares to the mac powder so
I'm<00:02:55.010> excited<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.459> try<00:02:55.640> this<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.209> still<00:02:56.690> have

that neutrogena powder by don't really
like<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.450> has<00:02:59.870> no<00:02:59.900> coverage

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
like it because it has no coverage

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.540 
like it because it has no coverage
should<00:03:00.590> i<00:03:00.680> use<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:00.980> setting<00:03:01.400> my<00:03:01.489> concealer

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.830 
should i use it for setting my concealer
last<00:03:02.540> thing<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.900> picked<00:03:03.080> up<00:03:03.320> was<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.830> Rimmel

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
last thing I picked up was the Rimmel

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.990 
last thing I picked up was the Rimmel
bronzer<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.900> 021<00:03:06.739> sunlight<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.760> didn't

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
bronzer and 021 sunlight and I didn't

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.520 
bronzer and 021 sunlight and I didn't
know<00:03:08.060> which<00:03:08.209> one<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.420> pick<00:03:08.600> up<00:03:08.810> some<00:03:09.140> light<00:03:09.350> or

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
know which one to pick up some light or

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.080 
know which one to pick up some light or
Sundance<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.340> think<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.910> will<00:03:11.030> fit

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
Sundance and I think this one will fit

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.910 
Sundance and I think this one will fit
me<00:03:11.360> better<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:12.200> looks<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.650> matte

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
me better and it looks like a matte

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.590 
me better and it looks like a matte
powder<00:03:13.160> I'm<00:03:13.489> not<00:03:13.640> really<00:03:13.850> sure<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.510> a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
powder I'm not really sure and it's a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.830 
powder I'm not really sure and it's a
little<00:03:14.840> bit<00:03:14.989> darker<00:03:15.200> than<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.270> NYC<00:03:17.270> sunny<00:03:17.600> one

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
little bit darker than the NYC sunny one

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.570 
little bit darker than the NYC sunny one
that<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:18.080> told<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.470> guys<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.770> hated<00:03:19.040> because<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
that I told you guys I hated because it

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.949 
that I told you guys I hated because it
does<00:03:19.730> nothing<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:22.580> here<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.120> two<00:03:23.330> side<00:03:23.750> by

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
does nothing so here the two side by

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.500 
does nothing so here the two side by
side<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:25.190> one<00:03:25.370> looks<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.700> lot<00:03:25.850> darker<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.390> will

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
side this one looks a lot darker it will

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.240 
side this one looks a lot darker it will
probably<00:03:26.750> bet<00:03:27.050> be<00:03:27.350> better<00:03:27.560> for<00:03:27.770> contouring

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
probably bet be better for contouring

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.949 
probably bet be better for contouring
because<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.700> one<00:03:28.940> I'm<00:03:29.150> just<00:03:29.360> using<00:03:29.570> as<00:03:29.840> a

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
because this one I'm just using as a

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.990 
because this one I'm just using as a
setting<00:03:30.350> powder<00:03:30.380> because<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.370> has<00:03:31.520> no<00:03:31.550> color

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
setting powder because it has no color

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.970 
setting powder because it has no color
at<00:03:32.270> all<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.840> packaging<00:03:33.320> on<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.620> is<00:03:33.770> really

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
at all the packaging on this is really

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.240 
at all the packaging on this is really
interesting<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.450> there's<00:03:36.260> no<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:36.500> flap

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
interesting it like there's no like flap

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.240 
interesting it like there's no like flap
so<00:03:37.790> I'm<00:03:38.000> afraid<00:03:38.330> it's<00:03:38.480> gonna<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.750> fall

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
so I'm afraid it's gonna like fall

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.380 
so I'm afraid it's gonna like fall
because<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.370> put<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:40.700> over<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:41.239> no

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
because you put this over and there's no

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.080 
because you put this over and there's no
clicky<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:42.080> make<00:03:42.230> sure<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.620> stayed<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.400> hope<00:03:43.940> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
clicky to make sure it stayed I hope you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.960
