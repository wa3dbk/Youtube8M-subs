00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
wonder how the ranking system actually

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.120

again a slight problem I'm having is
that<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.700> zero<00:03:55.060> squad<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.570> looking<00:03:55.870> pretty

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
that the zero squad is looking pretty

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.390 
that the zero squad is looking pretty
shitty<00:03:56.740> right<00:03:56.830> now

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
shitty right now

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.220 
shitty right now
Corinne<00:03:57.670> she<00:03:57.790> didn't<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.150> jack<00:03:58.480> shit<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.140> I'm

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
Corinne she didn't do jack shit and I'm

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.960 
Corinne she didn't do jack shit and I'm
guessing<00:03:59.920> he's<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.340> standing<00:04:00.640> around

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
guessing he's just standing around

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.150 
guessing he's just standing around
watching<00:04:01.510> shoot<00:04:01.990> ro<00:04:02.230> try<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.560> fight<00:04:02.860> off<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
sternritter but then she gets shot in

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.600 
sternritter but then she gets shot in
the<00:04:04.930> head<00:04:05.110> do<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.530> think<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.890> killed<00:04:06.280> her

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
the head do I think that killed her

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.490 
the head do I think that killed her
no<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.330> these<00:04:07.480> characters<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.110> been<00:04:08.140> built

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
no but these characters have been built

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.990 
no but these characters have been built
as<00:04:08.650> being<00:04:08.860> stronger<00:04:09.280> than<00:04:09.310> captain's<00:04:09.850> like

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
as being stronger than captain's like

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.210 
as being stronger than captain's like
Yamamoto<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.960> yet<00:04:11.080> two<00:04:11.440> out<00:04:11.710> of<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.980> five

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
have been pushed aside and I honestly

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.080 
have been pushed aside and I honestly
don't<00:04:14.800> think<00:04:14.890> we'll<00:04:15.220> get<00:04:15.340> closure<00:04:15.700> on<00:04:15.880> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
don't think we'll get closure on the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.180 
don't think we'll get closure on the
zero<00:04:16.299> squad<00:04:16.630> status<00:04:17.200> in<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.470> next<00:04:17.799> chapter

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
cuz it's at points like this that kuba

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.200 
cuz it's at points like this that kuba
pulls<00:04:20.470> away<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.799> something<00:04:21.190> else<00:04:21.340> plus<00:04:21.760> next

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
pulls away to something else plus next

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.180
