00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.969 

hey<00:00:00.179> guys<00:00:00.359> 4x<00:00:00.750> Cuban<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.319> and<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.829> video

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hey guys 4x Cuban here and in this video

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.230 
hey guys 4x Cuban here and in this video
I'll<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.340> teaching<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.820> guys<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.000> to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
I'll be teaching you guys how to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:14.480 
I'll be teaching you guys how to
lubricate<00:00:03.510> your<00:00:03.750> mo<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.110> out<00:00:04.470> suit<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.340> this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
lubricate your mo you out suit so this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.790 
lubricate your mo you out suit so this
method<00:00:14.670> works<00:00:15.089> both<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.870> outs<00:00:16.049> -<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
method works both on the outs - and the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
method works both on the outs - and the
waist<00:00:16.980> -<00:00:17.160> because<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.180> basically<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.779> same

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
waist - because it's basically the same

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
waist - because it's basically the same
mechanism<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> pieces<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
mechanism just some of the pieces are a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
mechanism just some of the pieces are a
little<00:00:21.029> bit<00:00:21.150> differently<00:00:21.570> designed<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.619> it'll

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
little bit differently designed so it'll

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.410 
little bit differently designed so it'll
work<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.220> both<00:00:23.400> cubes<00:00:23.789> doesn't<00:00:24.119> matter<00:00:24.269> what

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
work for both cubes doesn't matter what

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330 
work for both cubes doesn't matter what
you<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> first<00:00:25.949> thing<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you have so the first thing you need to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.109 
you have so the first thing you need to
do<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:27.320> start<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.500> any<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.880> pull<00:00:30.090> out

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
do is start on any side and you pull out

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.950 
do is start on any side and you pull out
one<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> edge<00:00:31.560> pieces<00:00:32.630> take<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one of the edge pieces take out the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.020 
one of the edge pieces take out the
other<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> other<00:00:35.610> side<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
other one do that for the other side as

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
other one do that for the other side as
well<00:00:37.070> just<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> corners<00:00:40.040> it<00:00:41.040> might

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
well just take out the corners it might

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.619 
well just take out the corners it might
be<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.489> bit<00:00:41.730> difficult<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> might

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
be a little bit difficult and you might

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
be a little bit difficult and you might
have<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> loosen<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> tensions<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
have to loosen up the tensions of it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
have to loosen up the tensions of it
because<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.270> tensions<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> bit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
because I have my tensions are a bit

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.400 
because I have my tensions are a bit
tighter<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
tighter so just take out one of the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.540 
tighter so just take out one of the
corners<00:00:49.860> both<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> corners<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:50.969> showing

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
corners both the corners are showing

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
corners both the corners are showing
like<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.440> take<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.860> these

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like that and just take out these

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
like that and just take out these
centers<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:59.430> also<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> take<00:01:00.210> out

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
centers and you also need to take out

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
centers and you also need to take out
these<00:01:00.660> internal<00:01:01.350> pieces<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> doesn't

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
these internal pieces so it doesn't

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
these internal pieces so it doesn't
matter<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.430> internal<00:01:03.210> pieces<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:03.870> with

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
matter if internal pieces come out with

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.340 
matter if internal pieces come out with
them<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:05.600> ok<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.689> once<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.140> all

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
them or not ok so once you have all

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520 
them or not ok so once you have all
these<00:01:07.530> pieces<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.510> need<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> poke<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
these pieces out you need to poke the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.730 
these pieces out you need to poke the
outer<00:01:10.740> ring<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.600> core<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
outer ring down of the core you want to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
outer ring down of the core you want to
do<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> carefully<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.240> none<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
do it carefully so that none of the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.179 
do it carefully so that none of the
other<00:01:16.080> pieces<00:01:16.439> fall<00:01:16.770> out

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
other pieces fall out

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.539 
other pieces fall out
now<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.080> Lube<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.680> put<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> little

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
now just take some Lube and put a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:31.260 
now just take some Lube and put a little
bit<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:21.060> around<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.960> ring

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.260 

it's<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.049> little<00:01:32.290> bit<00:01:32.409> hard<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.710> see<00:01:33.130> but<00:01:33.270> that's

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
it's a little bit hard to see but that's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.539 
it's a little bit hard to see but that's
how<00:01:34.630> much<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.110> want<00:01:35.439> if<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.979> can<00:01:36.040> see<00:01:36.369> that

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
how much you want if you can see that

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.570 
how much you want if you can see that
it's<00:01:37.360> not<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.600> lot<00:01:37.930> it's<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.619> just<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.549> little

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
it's not a lot it's just just a little

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.179 
it's not a lot it's just just a little
bit<00:01:39.909> just<00:01:40.600> some<00:01:40.840> Luber<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.380> there<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.979> should

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
bit just some Luber on there that should

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.880 
bit just some Luber on there that should
be<00:01:42.310> good<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:43.170> let's<00:01:44.170> see<00:01:44.259> how<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.500> done<00:01:44.710> you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
be good and let's see how that done you

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.520 
be good and let's see how that done you
can<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.070> poke<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.759> back<00:01:46.000> up<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.530> then

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
can just poke this back up and then

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.080 
can just poke this back up and then
slide<00:01:48.189> these<00:01:48.490> centers<00:01:48.850> back<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.399> then<00:01:51.580> you

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
slide these centers back and then you

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.399 
slide these centers back and then you
just<00:01:52.149> want<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.450> slide<00:01:52.630> them<00:01:52.810> back<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.289> can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
just want to slide them back and you can

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.630 
just want to slide them back and you can
dig<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.649> go<00:01:53.740> back<00:01:53.920> if<00:01:54.070> they<00:01:54.189> watch<00:01:54.369> just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
dig and go back if they watch just

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.310 
dig and go back if they watch just
because<00:01:54.789> these<00:01:55.030> internal<00:01:55.840> pieces<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.229> are

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
because these internal pieces that are

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.350 
because these internal pieces that are
coming<00:01:56.350> out<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.399> then<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.820> want<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.210> put

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
coming out and then you want to put

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.999 
coming out and then you want to put
everything<00:01:58.929> else<00:01:59.170> back<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.560> its<00:01:59.710> original

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
everything else back in its original

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.499 
everything else back in its original
position<00:02:00.520> starting<00:02:01.179> off<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.420> these

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
position starting off with these

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.680 
position starting off with these
internal<00:02:01.929> pieces<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.759> once<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.119> have<00:02:04.299> them<00:02:04.539> in

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
internal pieces so once you have them in

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.139 
internal pieces so once you have them in
there<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.289> put<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> corners<00:02:06.700> back<00:02:06.940> in

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
there like that put the corners back in

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:15.240 
there like that put the corners back in
next<00:02:12.060> now<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.360> put<00:02:13.630> these<00:02:14.049> edges<00:02:14.799> back<00:02:15.010> in

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
next now just put these edges back in

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.199 
next now just put these edges back in
their<00:02:15.459> positions<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:21.400> before<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
their positions now before you put the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.759 
their positions now before you put the
last<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:22.720> centers<00:02:23.019> back<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.530> want<00:02:23.680> to

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
last two centers back and you want to

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.789 
last two centers back and you want to
put<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.160> bit<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.489> Lube<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.440> here

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
put a little bit of Lube just right here

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.550 
put a little bit of Lube just right here
on<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.130> little<00:02:27.160> black<00:02:27.610> part<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.959> center

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
on that little black part of the center

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.460 
on that little black part of the center
of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> center<00:02:30.040> pieces<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:31.060> both<00:02:31.480> sides<00:02:37.470> it

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
of the center pieces on both sides it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050 
of the center pieces on both sides it
doesn't<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:39.070> too<00:02:39.310> much<00:02:39.519> just<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
doesn't have to be too much just a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.140 
doesn't have to be too much just a
little<00:02:40.329> dab<00:02:40.570> would<00:02:40.959> be<00:02:41.109> good<00:02:41.440> enough<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
little dab would be good enough and it's

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.550 
little dab would be good enough and it's
okay<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> get<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:44.170> bit<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.290> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
okay if you get a little bit on the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.349 
okay if you get a little bit on the
white<00:02:44.709> part<00:02:44.950> that's<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.790> internal<00:02:46.180> pieces

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
white part that's on the internal pieces

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.810 
white part that's on the internal pieces
that's<00:02:47.079> ok<00:02:47.380> too<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:49.930> put<00:02:50.859> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
that's ok too and now it just put the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:00.650 
that's ok too and now it just put the
center's<00:02:52.150> back<00:02:52.359> in<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:58.950> turn<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.040> cube

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
center's back in and turn the cube

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.970 
center's back in and turn the cube
you'll<00:03:01.660> notice<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.170> huge<00:03:02.530> difference<00:03:03.130> in<00:03:03.310> speed

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
you'll notice a huge difference in speed

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.430 
you'll notice a huge difference in speed
now<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.430> turn<00:03:06.700> these<00:03:06.940> centers<00:03:07.299> because<00:03:08.260> you

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
now just turn these centers because you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.509 
now just turn these centers because you
put<00:03:08.680> some<00:03:08.920> Lube<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.880> here<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:12.250> keep

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
put some Lube in here and just keep

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.789 
put some Lube in here and just keep
turning<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.660> works<00:03:14.410> its<00:03:14.620> way

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
turning that so that works its way

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.849 
turning that so that works its way
around<00:03:18.900> now<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:19.959> can<00:03:20.139> move<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.709> next

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
around now we can move on to the next

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.530 
around now we can move on to the next
center<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> don't<00:03:21.430> actually<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> turn

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
center you don't actually have to turn

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.960 
center you don't actually have to turn
after<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.650> do<00:03:23.769> each<00:03:23.920> Center<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.670> like

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
after you do each Center I just like

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360 
after you do each Center I just like
doing<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.170> can<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.739> all<00:03:26.950> at<00:03:27.100> once

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
doing that but you can do it all at once

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.460 
doing that but you can do it all at once
and<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.850> scramble<00:03:28.359> it<00:03:28.389> up<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.810> some<00:03:28.989> solves

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and just scramble it up do some solves

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.289 
and just scramble it up do some solves
but<00:03:29.850> anyways

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
but anyways

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:40.180 
but anyways
moving<00:03:31.660> on<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.989> next<00:03:32.139> side

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.810 

and<00:03:41.190> now<00:03:41.310> we<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.970> one

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
and now we can do this one

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.460 
and now we can do this one
so<00:03:44.820> poke<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.210> down<00:03:45.360> carefully<00:03:45.990> when<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.320> do

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
so poke it down carefully when you do

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
so poke it down carefully when you do
that<00:03:46.620> it'll<00:03:46.860> push<00:03:47.160> these<00:03:47.400> internal<00:03:47.760> pieces

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that it'll push these internal pieces

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.630 
that it'll push these internal pieces
back<00:03:48.330> which<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.080> okay<00:03:49.500> because<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.370> push

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
back which is okay because you can push

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.730 
back which is okay because you can push
if<00:03:50.910> when<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.300> push<00:03:51.810> these<00:03:51.990> centers<00:03:52.320> back<00:03:52.530> it

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
if when you push these centers back it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740 
if when you push these centers back it
will<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:52.890> back<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> normal<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.330> just<00:03:54.540> put<00:03:54.720> a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
will go back to normal so just put a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:33.890 
will go back to normal so just put a
little<00:03:54.960> bit<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.170> Lube<00:03:55.380> here<00:04:32.600> all<00:04:33.600> right<00:04:33.720> guys

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
little bit of Lube here all right guys

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.530 
little bit of Lube here all right guys
I'm<00:04:34.170> back<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.710> I've<00:04:35.160> lubed<00:04:35.640> all<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> sides

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
I'm back in I've lubed all of the sides

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.380 
I'm back in I've lubed all of the sides
and<00:04:37.020> once<00:04:37.350> you're<00:04:37.560> done<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.860> step<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:39.150> next

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
and once you're done that step the next

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.630 
and once you're done that step the next
thing<00:04:39.540> we<00:04:39.630> want<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.020> loop<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.980> pieces

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
thing we want to do is loop the pieces

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.370 
thing we want to do is loop the pieces
the<00:04:41.970> outer<00:04:42.120> layers<00:04:42.360> when<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> leave<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the outer layers when you leave the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.750 
the outer layers when you leave the
center's<00:04:43.710> you're<00:04:43.980> basically<00:04:44.430> being<00:04:44.700> the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
center's you're basically being the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.120 
center's you're basically being the
middle<00:04:45.120> layer<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.720> really<00:04:45.930> want<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.290> turn

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
middle layer and you really want to turn

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.310 
middle layer and you really want to turn
the<00:04:47.460> cube<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.790> lot<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.510> work<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.140> loop

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
the cube a lot so you can work that loop

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.380 
the cube a lot so you can work that loop
all<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> way<00:04:49.710> around<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.730> you'll<00:04:50.940> notice<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
all the way around and you'll notice the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.550 
all the way around and you'll notice the
sides<00:04:51.660> are<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.870> lot<00:04:52.080> faster<00:04:52.560> now<00:04:57.440> we're<00:04:58.440> not

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
sides are a lot faster now we're not

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.190 
sides are a lot faster now we're not
done<00:04:59.040> just<00:04:59.460> yet<00:04:59.670> you<00:05:00.330> want<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.600> pull<00:05:00.810> out<00:05:00.960> one

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
done just yet you want to pull out one

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.010 
done just yet you want to pull out one
of<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.380> edge<00:05:01.470> pieces<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.220> put<00:05:03.180> some<00:05:03.390> Lube<00:05:03.690> on

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
of the edge pieces and put some Lube on

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:13.280 
of the edge pieces and put some Lube on
the<00:05:04.470> inside<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> corner<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:12.840> put<00:05:13.050> enough

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
the inside of the corner just put enough

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.280 
the inside of the corner just put enough
so<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.710> whole<00:05:13.920> surface<00:05:14.190> of<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.580> corner<00:05:14.970> is

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
so the whole surface of the corner is

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.170 
so the whole surface of the corner is
full<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.280> kind<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.490> hard<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.820> see<00:05:18.000> but<00:05:18.030> I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
full and it's kind of hard to see but I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.170 
full and it's kind of hard to see but I
put<00:05:18.480> that<00:05:18.690> much<00:05:18.930> on<00:05:19.230> this<00:05:19.410> corner<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.180> just

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
put that much on this corner and just

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.500 
put that much on this corner and just
put<00:05:21.600> that<00:05:21.780> back<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.190> can<00:05:23.220> just<00:05:24.180> turn

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
put that back in and you can just turn

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.470 
put that back in and you can just turn
that<00:05:24.690> around<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.320> work<00:05:26.310> that<00:05:26.580> loop<00:05:26.910> around<00:05:27.120> a

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
that around and work that loop around a

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.390 
that around and work that loop around a
little<00:05:27.600> bit<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.740> might<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:28.890> easier<00:05:29.250> if<00:05:29.280> you

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
little bit and it might be easier if you

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.150 
little bit and it might be easier if you
lube<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:30.150> lot<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.170> pieces<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:31.650> then<00:05:31.770> turn<00:05:32.010> it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
lube a lot of pieces and then turn it

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.520 
lube a lot of pieces and then turn it
all<00:05:32.280> at<00:05:32.430> once<00:05:32.730> but<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:33.510> just<00:05:33.840> kind<00:05:34.260> of<00:05:34.320> do<00:05:34.500> it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
all at once but I just kind of do it

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.000 
all at once but I just kind of do it
random<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.480> just<00:05:36.480> take<00:05:37.200> another<00:05:37.410> one<00:05:37.650> put<00:05:37.950> a

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
random so just take another one put a

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.260 
random so just take another one put a
little<00:05:38.190> bit<00:05:38.310> more<00:05:38.370> on<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.640> should<00:05:42.030> be

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
little bit more on and that should be

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.020 
little bit more on and that should be
pretty<00:05:42.930> good<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.169> don't<00:05:43.350> need<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.590> lot<00:05:44.010> if<00:05:44.940> you

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
pretty good you don't need a lot if you

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.450 
pretty good you don't need a lot if you
feel<00:05:45.270> like<00:05:45.390> you<00:05:45.660> it's<00:05:46.080> not<00:05:46.290> enough<00:05:46.500> and

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
feel like you it's not enough and

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.610 
feel like you it's not enough and
just<00:05:47.639> keep<00:05:47.789> adding<00:05:48.150> more<00:05:48.180> Lube<00:05:48.569> as<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.410> go

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
just keep adding more Lube as you go

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.350 
just keep adding more Lube as you go
until<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.009> have<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.400> right<00:05:50.610> amount<00:05:50.819> that<00:05:51.240> you

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
until you have the right amount that you

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.240 
until you have the right amount that you
feel<00:05:51.539> is<00:05:51.660> good<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.199> think<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:52.800> is<00:05:52.979> a<00:05:53.009> good

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
feel is good I think this is a good

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.700 
feel is good I think this is a good
amount<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.759> Cube<00:05:54.150> is<00:05:54.300> incredibly<00:05:55.139> fast<00:05:55.470> it's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
amount and Cube is incredibly fast it's

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.089 
amount and Cube is incredibly fast it's
all<00:05:55.979> almost<00:05:56.880> uncontrollable<00:05:57.720> for<00:05:57.930> me<00:05:58.099> it'll

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
all almost uncontrollable for me it'll

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.830 
all almost uncontrollable for me it'll
be<00:05:59.250> good<00:05:59.460> out<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.759> box<00:06:00.000> but<00:06:00.389> once<00:06:00.630> you

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
be good out of the box but once you

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.900 
be good out of the box but once you
actually<00:06:01.590> fully<00:06:01.830> lube<00:06:02.069> it<00:06:02.250> it'll<00:06:02.520> be<00:06:02.669> amazing

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
actually fully lube it it'll be amazing
