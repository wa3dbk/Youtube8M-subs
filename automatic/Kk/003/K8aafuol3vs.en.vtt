00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.470
 thank you store nymph 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.000
 as well as tehnomir companies for 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.670
 provided device 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.360
 Hello everyone, I give you an example Czech 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.660
 and in this video I want to talk about two 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.490
 smartphones this is lenovo s920 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.470
 the one that blue more and s820 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.480
 which is little red and a little bit 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.900
 smaller well of course this video is called 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.870
 comparison of two smartphones from one 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.979
 of the same manufacturer I certainly would not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.300
 absolutely would call it a direct comparison but 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:55.949
 and the elements we still compare well 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.850
 let's just look at the appearance 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.190
 of this and another smartphone but this one is made 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.970
 soft touch plastic 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.590
 more smooth and sliding here too 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.350
 as if soft-touch plastic but he is that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.630
 practically and here but tilted he he 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.380
 don't stagger if this one will just 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 move out 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.020
 then this smartphone is somehow with us 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.840
 Now stick this surface it's something 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 more with sticky here by the way tear on 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.380
 back side they look very much like a camera 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.750
 in the middle 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 here is the only flash below and there 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.930
 flash to the side in this, as it were, and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 smartphone is better then what else is a microphone 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.830
 additionally there is no here and this 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.230
 small minus it when recording video this 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.470
 Well 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:54.310
 It will affect the dynamics of the ladies after all, from the bottom 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.980
 is there and there is a charging down here 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.440
 here on top 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.409
 by the way here is open charge and here 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.810
 it is covered with a special cap 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.429
 which I don't really like 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.530
 I talked about this so the first 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.440
 fundamental difference on the front 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.310
 it is of course the size of the screens you see 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.970
 that this is much more well this 5 3 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.670
 inches this goes with us 4 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.850
 inches though resolution on both 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.720
 smartphones the same here 1280 on 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.220
 720 that here 1280 to 720 and in that and in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.200
 tom smartphone worth mediatek processor 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.380
 quad 6589 underground 2 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.620
 gigahertz 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 further 1 gigabyte of RAM and 4 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.150
 the only other thing is that it is 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 multitouch up to 10 touches here just 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.320
 on 5 touches but i think it is generally 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.190
 hardly critical when you start 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.350
 use 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.400
 There may be some 10 touches 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.580
 straight specialized games for two 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.770
 but again, but for 10 touches it is also unlikely 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.640
 Is there another difference these have? 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.940
 smartphones is the volume of the battery is well logical 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.270
 that a larger smartphone has more volume 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 smaller smartphone smaller volume here 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.030
 it turns out two thousand 250 milliamps 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.769
 and the manufacturer gives it a standby 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.830
 up to 20 days and 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:40.080
 for conversation that is generally if 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:44.250
 talk on 2g networks then it's 25 hours 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.950
 work and lasts 12 hours in 3g mode 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.950
 same machine only goes week 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 standby time 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.630
 22 hours in mode 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.890
 2g and 10 hours in 3g mode 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.560
 but this is one such nuances here 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.500
 the battery wins much more precisely 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.510
 may even be saving somehow 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.930
 electricity and I don't even know why 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.299
 but the producers are like this 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.269
 the device gives much better performance 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.130
 rather than this machine though the processor 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.860
 the same RAM is the same here 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.770
 even smaller display 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 but here a little by volume is not the battery there well 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.349
 not much here and so here it is all 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.550
 Looks like someone I would advise 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.090
 to acquire 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.699
 what device in general 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.389
 I personally for example 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.150
 chose 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.090
 this or this smartphone but with that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.220
 that i have a tablet i would choose 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.080
 definitely only this phone because 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.139
 well why should I be so big if u 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.030
 I have a tablet if for example 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.970
 I would not have a tablet maybe I would 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.690
 looked at and lenovo s920 because 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.169
 here is the big screen 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.210
 further if you are a girl then I would 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.330
 would recommend you a smartphone with a smaller 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.100
 why the screen because the girth of the hand 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.860
 must fit normally that is 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.870
 well unless you are musical hands and 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.300
 long fingers you can then and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.070
 quietly use this device 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.280
 but this is a sort of nuance further what else 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:34.070
 so that this central button for 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:37.740
 people who are well for example by sight to 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.900
 need a bigger screen i will say that in 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.080
 principle and this screen is enough but you 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.510
 could take such well 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.530
 phone so that it would be much 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:54.330
 What follows is interesting that still wanted 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:58.110
 would say that if you are for example 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.340
 take it for social networks then for 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.229
 social networks 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:08.210
 It is very suitable and smaller apparatus why 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:11.849
 because well the screens are so big 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.810
 in principle, too, here on the lover crafty 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.680
 the question is probably personal 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.010
 preferences 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.910
 which screen I like better 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.710
 but certainly if you have a tablet that 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.650
 more phone I would probably less 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.930
 recommended to choose than this one 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.050
 smaller but basically everything I wanted 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.310
 tell about these devices and a and 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.310
 differences from each other 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:45.030
 both devices are very interesting both 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.890
 apparatus well beautiful but I still gave 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.000
 would prefer this red 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.820
 the apparatus he 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.890
 not much more like plus to everything 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.110
 if we talk about red, then he also 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.930
 thematic headphones reds go 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.030
 all this is very attractive and 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.920
 I wonder thank you for watching 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.600
 this video and how such a difference 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.970
 smartphones apart and to whom what 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.880
 more suitable to someone which more 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.410
 like it so choose don't forget

 including both reviews and unpacking these 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.340
 smartphones and just the same again
