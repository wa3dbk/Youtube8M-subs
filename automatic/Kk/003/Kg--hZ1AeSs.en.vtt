 I felt that they will participate because 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 I think it's the television but we though I think in the most time consuming 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.109
 We're going to have a stage for whoever presents 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.879
 who our neighborhood of igapó lie down we say that comes from our bar 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.519
 besides I think 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.449
 it is a vital element 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.820
 the establishment of the genre to study here 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.680
 here in brazil mainly in são paulo kurt wüthrich 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.579
 is the main activity 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.089
 I appreciated 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.429
 now the comedian has a house that is made 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.120
 really for those who enforce it 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 good luck, ours is that the country is very big the power 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.200
 the only Brazilian on the pitch who can rest easy but we can assume that 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.460
 one week 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.620
 for an hour what the government wants to show that the government actually commands 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.820
 here started now five years ago 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 2000 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 and I think that soon from the Machiavellian too 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 sheila's ability to adapt and create other types of units 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.790
 body and try to do one thing well at will to discuss 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.690
 and who has talked but want to do is going to stay 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.510
 and then it will rise again 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.290
 by the leaders' proposal until the date of departure 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.570
 came back up and fell 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.410
 the one who speaks the first lady of income 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.390
 She has a lot of history for me. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
 air we slaughter it near the end of growth the tendency is to lower the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160
 stabilize 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.580
 this language 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.790
 in a while 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.970
 I think it's going to be a little bit parted. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.440
 will be a tendency to mix 20 by a theatrical play will have a 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.500
 bit of a try and have other types of dead language 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.730

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.740
 I was extorting patcho 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.000
 the great talent 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 who choose another one that comes back to the top 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.860
 the current team the peak was low power will stay 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.620
 Why write? 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.060
 It's because the guy 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.990
 little opposition to the rhythm 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 the rumor 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.150
 It's okay to have 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.750
 nor that the capital amy's body was patented for years 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 although it has been recorded 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.110
 this path what you have done so far has been a junction of things 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949
 comedian ski deleted gender 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.599
