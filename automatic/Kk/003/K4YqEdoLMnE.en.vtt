00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.869
 after revealing the beginning of the following year 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.790
 the very first I have shown during e3 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.560
 2013 at the gamescom pangea brought 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.150
 again destiny despite the bad 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.680
 news is that it is not that there are 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.140
 lots of new information from 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 to tell you so I showed it was 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.320
 once again the same and the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.420
 more or less information said 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.190
 we can confirm that though 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.809
 destiny looks like a 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.030
 very interesting mix between a shooter 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.739
 in the first person and some elements 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 persistent that can be associated 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.300
 to the world of mmo rpg in particular 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.400
 what we liked is on one side 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.530
 the differentiation that the three classes 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.879
 seem to have and also that growth 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.850
 your character should have 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.190
 in the course of the adventure vangi held 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.930
 very much to say how the acquisition of 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.610
 new equipment the possibility of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.530
 also customize the aesthetics and make 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.909
 see what adventures and what challenges 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.350
 they were fought with their own 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.940
 character will be one of the components 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 fundamentals of the gaming experience 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.740
 same on the other side we have to say 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.150
 also a bit of a fan of bungee titles that 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.200
 the gameplay therefore especially the parts 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.330
 gun and rifle in hand look like 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.070
 absolutely solid and already with all the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.510
 series a eats it proved to know 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.050
 do so much to know how to create 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.930
 extremely immediate experiences but that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.120
 they know how to value what is the ability 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.470
 of the player and the increasing skill of the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.900
 player during the game experience 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.500
 so there is this very promising mix 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.480
 among a gameplay a very solid gameplay 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 really extremely solid and these 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.980
 mechanical halfway between singles 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 player and multiplayer is single player e 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.460
 mmo that really can give a foundation 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.260
 a further push to change gear 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.210
 but destiny and really distinguish it from a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.790
 first-person shooter panorama 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.050
 by now very flattened we hope to 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.830
 get new information already in 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.040
 coming months 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.270
 activision and bank bank are a lot 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.210
 tight as new information 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.220
 they seem to sip them with an image 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.690
 sometimes a new video from time to time 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.519
 we hope to be able to put the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.659
 eyes especially the hands in a very short time 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.620
 however as soon as we have new ones 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.620
 information we will keep you updated
