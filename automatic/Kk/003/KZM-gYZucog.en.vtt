um<00:02:02.390> pro<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.110> before<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.860> videos

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
um pro right now like before I do videos

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.650 
um pro right now like before I do videos
I'll<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.760> really<00:02:06.060> quick<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
I'll put this on really quick because it

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.749 
I'll put this on really quick because it
absorbs<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.500> oils<00:02:07.830> on<00:02:08.070> your<00:02:08.100> skin<00:02:08.399> it's

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
absorbs like your oils on your skin it's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.950 
absorbs like your oils on your skin it's
very<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:10.250> translucent<00:02:11.250> um<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.900> think

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
very very it's in translucent um I think

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.420 
very very it's in translucent um I think
that<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.380> might<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.740> couple<00:02:13.950> others

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
that they might have a couple others

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.610 
that they might have a couple others
shades<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.390> not<00:02:15.570> really<00:02:15.720> positive<00:02:16.350> though<00:02:16.470> by
