00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.959
 that someone merci means to a gameplay 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.959
 of need for speed world in this go on 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.420
 this time a tutorial for what they come 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:20.470
 being the dracs that is and greetings 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.080
 with the car of ironman the audi the web to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.100
 wilson and well let's go to the safe 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.619
 house to the car behind with which 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.100
 I'm going to explain how to know how to change 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.100
 car 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.220
 lamborghini Murcielago 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.950
 good that the first thing he has to have 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.050
 a car back first that is 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.940
 pretty acceleration and pretty 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.220
 tip speed ok 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 having these two already made him is 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.970
 quite powerful the car does not matter 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 much control as we will be in 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.100
 Straight line for skills 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 skills you can start with those that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 sells you in the game that are these 8 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.979
 % although if you want to get a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.990
 better performance you have to play a 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.860
 little bit more to get better here 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.280
 as you can see these are well pros 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.780
 100% of this would not be missing 32% for 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.780
 fill this but good 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.810
 let's go out 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.450
 and I will explain a technique with which 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 almost never going to lose is not that it is not 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.909
 nothing that skill like that is 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.979
 it's simply skill we're going to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.820
 select this join multiplayer not 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.820
 wait for it to fill 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.140
 and good as we found players 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.899
 Well, I got into the class that is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 with what is supposed to be my 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.439
 auto let's run against a kwh the ix 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.310
 in the guera that is thrown back to the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.960
 look and this one is made to give 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.649
 but I'll show you the technique 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.450
 so they can so they can get a 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.160
 little bit more speed as we can 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.700
 see 3 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.700
 do not 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 very well here he committed a fail at the beginning 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.710
 because it was pressed to that desktop 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.400
 of windows so well let's do it 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.670
 again 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 okay 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.000
 and well here we are again let's 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.400
 show I'll show you how it should be 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 21 we start in green according to the speed 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.110
 third speed here double nitro like this 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.240
 this is how it is used and with this they can reach 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.040
 a truly mad speed 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.170
 about the connection with the ix in which it comes 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.900
 ahead we can earn the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.270
 another one that comes back is about 2 per 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.060
 a hundred less verbal than me so 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.000
 obviously it's easy for him to win but so 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.370
 that's how the trick is 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.220
 in our position in the skill well 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.240
 that we are going to enter another one so that they see 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.280
 and that never fails 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.710
 and good here we are left you the other 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.160
 lamborghini but good what matters is 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:16.540
 show them how is one we start green 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.090
 green green 1 2 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.280
 12 yes I think it's that big 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 green handle and it's because I have him 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.030
 we scare them all blue as they can 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.430
 see 100% and how can you say this more 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 what ability is to be calm since if 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.390
 you do it in a hurry it will not leave you 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.290
 obviously you will not leave anything 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.299
 we win the connection 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.569
 for a little bit 13 seconds but good 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.090
 that's what I wanted to tell you 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.900
 it's not a hack I can remember it is not 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.629
 no hack 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.540
 ok is just skill and you can use it in 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.090
 his drag careers is quite useful not 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.659
 I'm going to tell you that it has not helped me 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.670
 beat him to turn off or probes to morphine 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:10.080
 and blowout aventador is etcetera 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.630
 and I really share them because I do not know 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.549
 I would like you to also use this 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 shift ability and control there is something 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.250
 I have to clarify them to see 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.050
 I have not put you what they see here is 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.380
 what he has given me that is already ofac 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.990
 site and it was very little the reason was with 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.490
 fairies to laugh remembered to recover the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.880
 emeralds of the cause of the loss of 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.630
 new but that does not matter I have not bought 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.630
 absolutely nothing with bus 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.029
 he is in exaggeration I have only bought 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.099
 one thing with bus 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:49.819
 all this has been the pomegranate in the 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.499
 drags in addition to the persecutions and that 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.919
 it's the only thing I bought with busse I'm going 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.919
 to show 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.989
 is 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.769
 that is the only one that I bought with 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:02.769
 boroughs with you 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.409
 a body kit for sex but it's what 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.720
 unique so please stop and stop 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.250
 accusing me of hacks nothing more entertains me 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.960
 in this game ok 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.340
