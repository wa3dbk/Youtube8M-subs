00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.719
 good afternoon today we are with you and in this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.219
 video will be about samsung smartphone 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 galaxy s5 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.760
 a new south korean flagship was shown 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.070
 at mwc 2014 in barcelona and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.660
 went on sale April 11, 2014 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 long-awaited novelty got refreshed 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.759
 fingerprint scanner design 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.390
 heart rate monitor new interface and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 waterproof case 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 but first things first appearance 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 galaxy s5 hardly be called original, he 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.190
 considers everything we saw in the past 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.050
 flagship companies distinguish smartphone 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.870
 rounded edges physical button 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 home chrome sides in the same 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 time when looking at the phone and languages â€‹â€‹do not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 spinning remnant of a word as it was the case 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.649
 galaxy s3 and partly galaxy s4 straight 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.859
 lines of you 5 obviously more 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.199
 contrary to some rumored smartphone tops 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.350
 stayed plastic metal case 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.220
 samsung has decided not to implement but under 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.689
 no one masks the galaxy s5 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 on the contrary, the company tried to find 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.549
 regular original solution for the back 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.970
 the cover as it was with a disguise galaxy 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.770
 note 3 under the skin back cover galaxy s5 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 something like material to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.740
 sheathed inside some panels 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500
 cars 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.180
 he is soft and smooth to the touch entirely 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 filled perforations 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.829
 in our opinion the skin speak inside 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.890
 looks more interesting but in general and new 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.020
 also looks original especially if 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.990
 purchase models are not black 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.899
 color 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.500
 four colors are still available black 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.450
 white turquoise and gold galaxy s5 has become 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.850
 noticeably more bulky and heavy 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.590
 phones compare miss galaxy s4 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.210
 his weight increased by 15 grams to 145 grams 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.030
 the diagonal of the la vazov screen is only one 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.950
 tenth of an inch but isabel permeability 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 smartphone still got a few extra 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 millimeters on the sides in the hand is all 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.630
 still comfortable though it's not so noticeable 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.510
 the device starts to remind more and more 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.220
 galaxy line but for the female hand he 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.069
 still somewhat too big 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.400
 the front panel is a smartphone 3 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.440
 traditional bottom button on top 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 light sensors are located and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.110
 approximation of the front camera lens 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.360
 and the speaker is picked up by the back of the phone 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.030
 is the bottom speaker it is you 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 against his camera lens synthesis 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.530
 one flash combined with pulse measures 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.430
 burbot is the rocker 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.430
 volume control 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.310
 On the right is the power button 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.110
 upper end 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.120
 given under the headphone out and 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.870
 headsets as well as the port for 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 consumer electronics control bottom 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.970
 located connector usb 30 closed 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.680
 waterproof plug last 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 have to open each time to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.890
 charge the battery or connect 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 smartphone to computer 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.140
 over time it starts to bother like 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.870
 we said galaxy s5 is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 waterproof phone in particular 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.640
 left protection standard used 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.980
 security api 67 which guarantee 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.320
 immersion to a depth of 1 meter VTI 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.050
 over there we spent seven minutes 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.580
 Full-scale test of the smartphone with water from 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.410
 samsung brand technology as possible 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.790
 notice the machine keep full 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.190
 water performance 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.190
 although she may complicate working with her 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.480
 autumn extract galaxy s5 from water rays 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.909
 some time from bed to cover 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.340
 so that the moisture does not get protected 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.090
 device areas in other words 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.069
 dry it for two to three hours 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.409
 galaxy s5 comes in two main 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.139
 quad - core modifications 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.470
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.709
 and eight core equity shares 54 22 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.009
 in theory both versions are capable of networking 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.440
 lte and and are approximately equal in speed also 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.139
 the smartphone has 2 gigabytes of RAM memory 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.410
 built-in flash memory 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.550
 16 or 32 gigabyte screen diagonal 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.780
 is 5 and 1 inch at resolution 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.870
 1920 to 1080 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.060
 or full hd screen based on matrix 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.210
 super amoled that guarantees excellent 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.889
 color reproduction and maximum viewing angles 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.650
 also worth noting a very decent 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.960
 For years technology 320 brightness candela 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.289
 per square meter in the preceding 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.690
 models it was noticeably lower 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 galaxy s5 running 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.490
 android 4 4 2 which also complement 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.550
 own samsung touchwiz shell 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.800
 in the new version and feature updated menu 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.080
 settings which will now be but 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.300
 a huge variety of similar foreign 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.590
 icons tangled in them will not make 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.080
 special work 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.900
 among other things, a new smartphone 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.120
 got a special energy mode 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.280
 movement able to save charge 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.500
 energy by transferring the image to 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.930
 black and white frequency reduction 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.660
 CPU shutdown of various services 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.729
 and so on for maximum savings 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.130
 You can work with the phone to five 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.340
 six hours inflict interest charge 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.590
 battery is quite impressive 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.690
 s health app version 30 got 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.660
 new interface and new features for 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.060
 tracking your activity and start 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.280
 you will need to enter your parameters after 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.080
 what can make training schedules 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.199
 set achievements target 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.199
 indicators 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.810
 here you can measure the pulse with 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.810
 cudjoe winds 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.890
 camera galaxy s5 received a resolution of 16 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.450
 megapixels and technology and social also 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.530
 Now the ability to shoot video 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.330
 Ultra hd or 4k resolution all settings 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.760
 cameras are grouped in one grid 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.670
 a table that is somewhat scary at first 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.590
 there are also special shooting modes 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.820
 the camera itself does very 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.220
 high-quality images 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.130
 front camera resolution left 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.290
 the former 2 megapixel video it is capable 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.690
 capture resolution full hd 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.660
 on this we finish our video about 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.880
 samsung galaxy s5 novelty 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.160
 Of particular interest though 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.050
 not without flaws more about 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.090
 other features of the flagship can 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.520
