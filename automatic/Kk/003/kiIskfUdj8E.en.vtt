00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you throw in washing or notice another

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.710 
you throw in washing or notice another
good<00:01:53.790> player<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> they've<00:01:54.329> been<00:01:54.450> throwing<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
good player that they've been throwing a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.160 
good player that they've been throwing a
lot<00:01:54.840> lately<00:01:55.219> another<00:01:56.219> Terran<00:01:56.520> player<00:01:56.640> so

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
lot lately another Terran player so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.149 
lot lately another Terran player so
don't<00:01:58.170> necessarily<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> throw<00:01:58.829> him<00:01:59.009> in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
don't necessarily want to throw him in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.940 
don't necessarily want to throw him in
either<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:01.020> instead<00:02:01.469> they're<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> throw

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
either so instead they're going to throw

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.289 
either so instead they're going to throw
a<00:02:02.009> desert<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.700> makes<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.000> lot<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.180> sense

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
a desert and that makes a lot of sense

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.929 
a desert and that makes a lot of sense
because<00:02:03.780> kannada<00:02:04.399> even<00:02:05.399> though<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> zerg<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
because kannada even though the zerg is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.600 
because kannada even though the zerg is
kind<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> middle<00:02:06.659> matchup<00:02:07.049> he's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
kind of this middle matchup he's

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.510 
kind of this middle matchup he's
statistically<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.789> even<00:02:09.149> i<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.840> serve

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
statistically about even i can serve

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
statistically about even i can serve
and<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.600> only<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.960> bad<00:02:13.260> matchup

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and so it's it's not only a bad matchup

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.870 
and so it's it's not only a bad matchup
form<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> good<00:02:14.670> matchup

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
form but it's not really a good matchup

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.940 
form but it's not really a good matchup
from<00:02:15.180> either<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.260> throwing<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.740> very

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
from either and so throwing in a very

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
from either and so throwing in a very
good<00:02:17.100> sir<00:02:17.220> clear<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.640> column<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.540> probably

game my big kannada here so it looks
like<00:03:56.070> he's<00:03:56.250> gone<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:58.110> think<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.190> was<00:03:59.310> a

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
like he's gone for I think that was a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.259 
like he's gone for I think that was a
over<00:04:00.390> pool<00:04:01.100> because<00:04:02.100> he<00:04:02.310> see<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.489> second<00:04:03.060> over

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
over pool because he see a second over

over pool because he see a second over

word moving away from his base at the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
some quick zerglings out here just to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.699 
some quick zerglings out here just to
try<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.630> put<00:04:09.810> some<00:04:09.959> pressure<00:04:10.110> on<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.380> kannada

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709

try and put some pressure on it kannada
actually<00:04:11.040> he's<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> put<00:04:11.430> down<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.580> bunker

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
actually he's going to put down a bunker

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.229 
actually he's going to put down a bunker
just<00:04:13.140> below<00:04:13.350> his<00:04:13.440> ramp<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.920> try<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.280> attract

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
just below his ramp to try and attract

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.370 
just below his ramp to try and attract
against<00:04:15.480> out<00:04:15.600> looks<00:04:15.810> like<00:04:15.930> he's<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.230> try

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
against out looks like he's going to try

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620 
against out looks like he's going to try
and<00:04:16.410> expand<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.250> bunker<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:18.239> needs<00:04:18.539> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
and expand so that bunker in needs that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.510 
and expand so that bunker in needs that
bunker<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.410> order<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.710> protect<00:04:20.039> his<00:04:20.340> base

bunker to in order to protect his base
in<00:04:20.549> order<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.910> expand

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
in order to expand

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.260 
in order to expand
and<00:04:21.860> he's<00:04:22.010> getting<00:04:22.160> some<00:04:22.400> reason<00:04:22.730> as<00:04:22.820> well<00:04:22.850> it

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and he's getting some reason as well it

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.900 
and he's getting some reason as well it
is<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.570> long<00:04:24.170> distance<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.520> going<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.670> help

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
is a long distance it's going to help

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.610 
is a long distance it's going to help
cannot<00:04:26.330> adjust<00:04:26.660> for<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.930> moment<00:04:27.170> but<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.560> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
cannot adjust for the moment but in the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
cannot adjust for the moment but in the
late<00:04:27.770> game<00:04:27.980> that's<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.490> problem

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
late game that's going to be a problem

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.990 
late game that's going to be a problem
four<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.090> them<00:04:29.240> told<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:30.730> it's<00:04:31.730> going<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> make

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
four of them told you it's going to make

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.530 
four of them told you it's going to make
it<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.300> lot<00:04:32.630> more<00:04:32.660> difficult<00:04:33.200> for<00:04:33.230> kanana<00:04:33.620> to

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
it a lot more difficult for kanana to

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.270 
it a lot more difficult for kanana to
you<00:04:35.540> know<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.380> move<00:04:36.620> all<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.160> across

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
you know to to move all the way across

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.490 
you know to to move all the way across
the<00:04:37.460> map<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.000> attack<00:04:38.270> him<00:04:38.480> sending<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.410> as

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
the map to attack him sending it as

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.460 
the map to attack him sending it as
simple<00:04:39.740> as<00:04:39.830> early<00:04:40.040> wow<00:04:40.310> how<00:04:40.550> did<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.760> survive

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
simple as early wow how did I survive

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.990 
simple as early wow how did I survive
aww<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:43.250> guess<00:04:43.280> there's<00:04:43.580> probably<00:04:43.610> only<00:04:43.880> one

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
aww I guess there's probably only one

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.150 
aww I guess there's probably only one
marine<00:04:44.300> in<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.510> bunker<00:04:44.780> right<00:04:44.900> now<00:04:45.050> maybe<00:04:45.260> and

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
marine in the bunker right now maybe and

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.470 
marine in the bunker right now maybe and
that's<00:04:46.310> what's<00:04:46.490> going<00:04:46.670> on<00:04:46.850> but<00:04:47.440> whoa<00:04:48.440> kannada

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
that's what's going on but whoa kannada

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.450 
that's what's going on but whoa kannada
moving<00:04:50.480> his<00:04:50.600> scvs<00:04:50.960> out<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.500> way<00:04:51.620> that's

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
moving his scvs out of the way that's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.690 
moving his scvs out of the way that's
kind<00:04:52.670> of<00:04:53.770> risky<00:04:56.590> okay<00:04:57.590> anyway<00:04:57.920> well<00:04:58.430> he<00:04:58.580> knows

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
kind of risky okay anyway well he knows

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.490 
kind of risky okay anyway well he knows
best<00:04:58.940> he<00:04:59.180> decided<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.540> pull<00:04:59.720> this<00:04:59.870> he's<00:05:00.110> out<00:05:00.290> he

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
best he decided to pull this he's out he

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.900 
best he decided to pull this he's out he
saw<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.740> one's<00:05:00.950> early<00:05:01.310> go<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.580> there<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:01.760> run

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
saw that one's early go in there and run

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.030 
saw that one's early go in there and run
away<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.090> guess<00:05:02.300> maybe<00:05:02.600> he<00:05:03.290> knew<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:03.770> his

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
away I guess maybe he knew that his

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460 
away I guess maybe he knew that his
defenses<00:05:04.790> have<00:05:04.940> been<00:05:05.000> tested<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.600> he<00:05:05.960> he<00:05:06.260> saw

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
defenses have been tested and he he saw

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.930 
defenses have been tested and he he saw
that<00:05:06.620> he<00:05:06.770> was<00:05:06.920> making<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.250> lot<00:05:07.340> more<00:05:07.370> zerglings

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
that he was making a lot more zerglings

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.610 
that he was making a lot more zerglings
in<00:05:08.030> his<00:05:08.120> base<00:05:08.300> some<00:05:08.750> servings<00:05:09.110> are<00:05:09.170> chasing<00:05:09.440> at

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
in his base some servings are chasing at

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.650 
in his base some servings are chasing at
STV<00:05:09.860> rounds<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.580> guess<00:05:11.150> he<00:05:11.240> knew<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.540> not

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
STV rounds so I guess he knew that not

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.730 
STV rounds so I guess he knew that not
all<00:05:11.780> deserving<00:05:12.080> actually<00:05:12.500> know<00:05:12.590> though

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
all deserving actually know though

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.840 
all deserving actually know though
certainly<00:05:13.010> has<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.310> got<00:05:13.430> pulled<00:05:13.610> back<00:05:13.700> to

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
certainly has just got pulled back to

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.430 
certainly has just got pulled back to
chase<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.330> SUV<00:05:14.660> so<00:05:14.840> they<00:05:15.020> he<00:05:15.170> didn't<00:05:15.380> know

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
chase the SUV so they he didn't know

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.650 
chase the SUV so they he didn't know
that<00:05:15.590> they<00:05:15.680> were<00:05:15.710> going<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:15.890> be<00:05:16.010> there<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.630> a

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
that they were going to be there so a

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.510 
that they were going to be there so a
little<00:05:17.810> bit<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.380> little<00:05:18.590> bit<00:05:18.800> risky<00:05:19.160> i<00:05:19.190> guess<00:05:19.370> it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
little bit a little bit risky i guess it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.920 
little bit a little bit risky i guess it
cannot<00:05:19.730> go<00:05:19.880> pull<00:05:20.060> those<00:05:20.180> stds<00:05:20.420> out<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.810> way

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
cannot go pull those stds out of the way

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.900 
cannot go pull those stds out of the way
but<00:05:21.340> anyway<00:05:24.070> he<00:05:25.070> has<00:05:25.280> managed<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.640> get<00:05:25.730> that

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
but anyway he has managed to get that

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.520 
but anyway he has managed to get that
expansion<00:05:26.240> up<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.810> pretty<00:05:27.080> big<00:05:27.200> he's

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
expansion up and that is pretty big he's

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.460 
expansion up and that is pretty big he's
very<00:05:28.250> easy<00:05:28.910> secured<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.840> expansion<00:05:30.200> with

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
very easy secured that expansion with

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.220 
very easy secured that expansion with
minimal<00:05:30.860> resources<00:05:31.010> used<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:32.020> he's<00:05:33.020> going<00:05:33.170> to

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
minimal resources used and he's going to

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.750 
minimal resources used and he's going to
have<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.350> real<00:05:33.620> big<00:05:33.740> economic<00:05:33.950> advantage<00:05:34.670> I

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
have a real big economic advantage I

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.330 
have a real big economic advantage I
think<00:05:34.790> going<00:05:35.180> into<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.450> big<00:05:35.660> game<00:05:35.840> because

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
think going into the big game because

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.260 
think going into the big game because
even<00:05:37.340> though<00:05:39.370> so<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.430> calm<00:05:40.700> has<00:05:40.850> gotten<00:05:41.180> that

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
even though so I calm has gotten that

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.180 
even though so I calm has gotten that
the<00:05:41.540> tool<00:05:41.840> he's<00:05:42.200> gotten<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.530> second<00:05:42.890> hatchery

usually<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:56.990> Zerg<00:05:57.170> have<00:05:57.350> less<00:05:57.530> drones<00:05:57.860> at

their bases and that sort of thing and
so<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.480> they<00:06:02.960> need<00:06:03.770> more<00:06:03.890> bases<00:06:04.340> again<00:06:04.640> just

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240

busy<00:06:59.090> rounding<00:06:59.510> my<00:06:59.630> other<00:06:59.810> stuff<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.410> now

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
busy rounding my other stuff and now

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.050 
busy rounding my other stuff and now
he's<00:07:00.710> got<00:07:00.860> a<00:07:00.889> spire<00:07:01.250> going<00:07:01.550> down<00:07:01.699> at<00:07:01.820> a<00:07:01.850> nice

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
he's got a spire going down at a nice

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.780 
he's got a spire going down at a nice
little<00:07:02.380> Trixie<00:07:03.380> position<00:07:03.830> kind<00:07:04.430> of<00:07:04.490> off<00:07:04.610> on

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
little Trixie position kind of off on

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.129 
little Trixie position kind of off on
the<00:07:04.880> side<00:07:05.120> so<00:07:05.479> it'll<00:07:05.630> be<00:07:05.690> difficult<00:07:05.930> for

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
the side so it'll be difficult for

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.620 
the side so it'll be difficult for
kannada<00:07:07.070> if<00:07:07.310> he<00:07:07.460> when<00:07:07.820> he<00:07:07.880> comsats<00:07:08.360> it'll<00:07:08.570> be

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
kannada if he when he comsats it'll be

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.600 
kannada if he when he comsats it'll be
difficult<00:07:08.780> from<00:07:09.139> the<00:07:09.260> spot<00:07:09.530> that<00:07:09.560> he's<00:07:10.460> not

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
difficult from the spot that he's not

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.860 
difficult from the spot that he's not
going<00:07:10.790> to<00:07:10.850> have<00:07:10.940> concept<00:07:11.360> for<00:07:11.540> a<00:07:11.570> minute

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
going to have concept for a minute

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.700 
going to have concept for a minute
anyway<00:07:12.880> so<00:07:13.880> he's<00:07:14.300> probably<00:07:14.750> only<00:07:15.350> going<00:07:15.560> to<00:07:15.650> be

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
anyway so he's probably only going to be

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.580 
anyway so he's probably only going to be
able<00:07:15.740> to<00:07:15.919> come<00:07:16.100> sat<00:07:16.810> you<00:07:17.810> know<00:07:17.930> right<00:07:18.440> when
