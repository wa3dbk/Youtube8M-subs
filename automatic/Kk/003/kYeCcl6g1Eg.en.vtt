the iphone i mean is kind of choppy
let's<00:01:58.200> look<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> page<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:01.250> i'm<00:02:02.250> going

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
let's look at a page over here i'm going

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
let's look at a page over here i'm going
to<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:03.590> look<00:02:04.590> at<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:05.040> get

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to go back look at this will get

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
to go back look at this will get
something<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.140> graphical

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
something with a bit more graphical

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.490 
something with a bit more graphical
quality<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> screw<00:02:09.720> attack

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
quality so if we go to screw attack

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.030 
quality so if we go to screw attack
calm

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.540 

see<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.120> works

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.870 

then<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> zoom<00:02:27.930> in

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.180 

so<00:02:35.540> hopefully<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.800> it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
so hopefully you can see that that it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.030 
so hopefully you can see that that it
looks<00:02:37.370> really<00:02:38.030> choppy<00:02:38.690> or<00:02:39.260> scrolls<00:02:39.770> really

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
looks really choppy or scrolls really

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.940 
looks really choppy or scrolls really
