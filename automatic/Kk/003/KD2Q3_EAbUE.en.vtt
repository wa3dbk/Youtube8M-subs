put the tape on what I need to do so I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.589

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
put tape across like that and I do three

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.630 
put tape across like that and I do three
pieces<00:02:00.840> covering<00:02:01.349> the<00:02:01.439> fold<00:02:01.619> line<00:02:01.890> I'll<00:02:02.429> show

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
pieces covering the fold line I'll show

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.819 
pieces covering the fold line I'll show
you<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.909> second<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you in a second I think people do just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.210 
you in a second I think people do just
one<00:02:05.009> piece<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.489> tape<00:02:05.989> you<00:02:06.989> know<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.709> long<00:02:07.920> way

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
one piece of tape you know the long way

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.460 
one piece of tape you know the long way
sometimes<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> short<00:02:10.259> way

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
sometimes they do is the short way

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.559 
sometimes they do is the short way
really<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.420> makes

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
really up to you I don't think it makes

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.089 
really up to you I don't think it makes
much<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.019> difference<00:02:13.049> in<00:02:13.560> protecting<00:02:13.980> your

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
much of a difference in protecting your

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.670 
much of a difference in protecting your
comic<00:02:14.480> although<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.200> might<00:02:16.440> make<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
comic although it might make a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.569 
comic although it might make a
difference<00:02:16.769> when<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.220> comes<00:02:17.280> down<00:02:17.519> to

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
difference when it comes down to

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.819 
difference when it comes down to
humidity<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.329> see<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.140> public<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.590> nicely

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
humidity and see the public is nicely

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.509 
humidity and see the public is nicely
covered<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.319> field<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.340> i

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
covered and field and as you can see i

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.890 
covered and field and as you can see i
did<00:02:23.819> three<00:02:24.560> pieces<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.739> tape<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:26.900> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
did three pieces of tape right there so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.569 
did three pieces of tape right there so
that's<00:02:28.410> basically<00:02:28.560> how<00:02:28.859> you<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> trade

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
that's basically how you do the trade

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.150 
that's basically how you do the trade
you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:30.959> some<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.380> larger<00:02:31.829> card

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you can do some of the larger card

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.240 
you can do some of the larger card
covers<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.040> tight<00:02:35.220> fit

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
covers like that but it's a tight fit

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.069 
covers like that but it's a tight fit
you're<00:02:35.940> probably<00:02:36.120> better<00:02:36.359> off<00:02:36.510> with<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
you're probably better off with the

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.190 
you're probably better off with the
larger<00:02:37.620> comm<00:02:38.340> book<00:02:38.720> covers<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.019> will

that after a long time that you have

that after a long time that you have
these<00:07:39.400> covers<00:07:39.760> on<00:07:39.930> picking<00:07:40.930> them<00:07:41.050> off<00:07:41.170> will

these covers on picking them off will

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.230 
these covers on picking them off will
probably<00:07:41.770> damaged<00:07:42.100> it<00:07:42.250> to<00:07:42.340> be<00:07:42.490> so<00:07:43.060> protective

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 
probably damaged it to be so protective

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.480 
probably damaged it to be so protective
or<00:07:43.930> the<00:07:44.440> pace<00:07:44.710> so<00:07:44.950> you're<00:07:45.100> probably<00:07:45.220> just

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
or the pace so you're probably just

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.190 
or the pace so you're probably just
going<00:07:45.640> to<00:07:45.730> have<00:07:45.820> to<00:07:45.880> grab<00:07:46.660> a<00:07:46.690> new<00:07:46.960> one<00:07:47.170> and
