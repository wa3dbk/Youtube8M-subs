00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
they did they did do a lot of polishing

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.990 
they did they did do a lot of polishing
on<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.500> game<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.949> frame<00:03:24.430> rates<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:24.759> stuff

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
on this game the frame rates and stuff

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.240 
on this game the frame rates and stuff
are<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.180> as<00:03:25.540> good<00:03:25.659> as<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> ps2<00:03:26.259> but<00:03:27.069> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
are just as good as a ps2 but the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.640 
are just as good as a ps2 but the
graphics<00:03:27.579> are<00:03:27.669> a<00:03:27.699> lot<00:03:27.879> better<00:03:28.030> um<00:03:28.590> when<00:03:29.590> you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
graphics are a lot better um when you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.929 
graphics are a lot better um when you
watch<00:03:29.799> cutscene<00:03:30.280> it's<00:03:30.459> kind<00:03:30.639> of<00:03:30.699> weird

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
watch cutscene it's kind of weird

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.670 
watch cutscene it's kind of weird
because<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.299> cutscenes<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.290> graphics

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
because the cutscenes like the graphics

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.550 
because the cutscenes like the graphics
are<00:03:32.799> like<00:03:32.919> a<00:03:33.189> third<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.389> what<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:34.569> are<00:03:34.689> in

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
are like a third of what they are in

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.129 
are like a third of what they are in
this<00:03:36.340> game<00:03:36.400> actually<00:03:37.030> after<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:37.840> redid<00:03:38.079> it

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
this game actually after they redid it

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.280 
this game actually after they redid it
so<00:03:38.979> that's<00:03:39.129> kind<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.430> weird<00:03:39.609> but<00:03:40.079> check<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.169> out

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
so that's kind of weird but check it out

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.999 
so that's kind of weird but check it out
it's<00:03:41.879> fantastic<00:03:42.879> if<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.030> haven't<00:03:43.299> lately
