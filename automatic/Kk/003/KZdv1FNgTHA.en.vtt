00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
this guy really helped increase mobility

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.780 
this guy really helped increase mobility
in<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> ankle<00:01:18.439> because<00:01:18.829> sometimes<00:01:19.280> when

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
in the ankle because sometimes when

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.830 
in the ankle because sometimes when
we're<00:01:19.939> doing<00:01:20.060> squats<00:01:20.649> in<00:01:21.649> particular<00:01:22.840> people

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
we're doing squats in particular people

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.190 
we're doing squats in particular people
have<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.170> tendency<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:25.659> kind<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.780> screw<00:01:27.049> up

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
have a tendency to kind of screw up

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.760 
have a tendency to kind of screw up
their<00:01:27.380> form<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.979> their<00:01:28.939> squats<00:01:29.360> because<00:01:29.810> they

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
their form in their squats because they

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.940 
their form in their squats because they
have<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.450> decreased<00:01:32.450> mobility<00:01:32.770> range<00:01:33.770> of

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
have a decreased mobility range of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.609 
have a decreased mobility range of
motion<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.610> ankle<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.320> helps

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
motion in that ankle so this helps

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.499 
motion in that ankle so this helps
really<00:01:36.890> loosen<00:01:37.220> up<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.429> soleus<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.270> lower

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
really loosen up the soleus that lower

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.120 
really loosen up the soleus that lower
part<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.049> calf<00:01:39.259> muscle<00:01:41.679> what<00:01:42.679> I'll<00:01:42.770> do<00:01:42.979> is

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130

part of the calf muscle what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:43.280> turn<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:44.060> little<00:01:44.840> bit<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:46.420> same<00:01:47.420> position

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
I'll turn a little bit so same position
