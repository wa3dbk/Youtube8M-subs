00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to you with the channel asset today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.609
 we will look at monster beats headphones 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 tour 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 let's headphones so complete in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:40.379
 us you case cover consider later you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:43.430
 yourself headphones you than me these headphones 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.539
 quite a long time already therefore them 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.129
 flew off looked 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.129
 icon beech both on one is on the second 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 No, in principle, the books do not affect the window 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.760
 don't know so what about four pairs 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.930
 replaceable 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 such things here they are completely different 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:19.520
 too, under the size of a wide narrow herringbone 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.520
 such here we can also side 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:42.479
 further book then instruction on 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:48.680
 great english french nirvana with 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:55.700
 understood by the village russian 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:00.530
 It seems there is not observed for the Russian 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 Further such a beam in my opinion I do not remember 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.740
 was filled with say headphones in the very 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.289
 the box itself does not need them so well 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 so here's a clothes pin 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.580
 that is, this is something to attach to clothes and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:24.450
 so what can I say about 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:27.799
 Headphone headphone design made very 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.000
 well that is this is such a stylish wire 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:35.250
 well with and flat wire 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 the fact that he is less confused and beautiful 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:44.239
 Looks like let's talk how 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.489
 distinguish a fake headphone from a single 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.739
 of course we understand now that she is everything 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.720
 Almost all of Chinaâ€™s trading market 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.790
 for the good will have to intercept 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.320
 Well, let us have the German market or 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 some more you have to overpay 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.310
 how to distinguish a fake original 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.959
 Well, firstly it is on the box itself 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.880
 minister kill read the text can be seen if 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.670
 poison bug then this is this for a long time to all 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.989
 known not so global but in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.510
 mostly here's a portrait 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.060
 the hall of the box we can see now 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.250
 see what 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 and a little bit of our nato on Chinese 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.810
 it just can not see not the picture 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.380
 darker just she doesn't 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.660
 printed on the box but in principle 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.599
 nothing else except from the neck 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:55.370
 about the box itself , we are nothing 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.800
 We can not say there was nothing like she here 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.069
 it is if it is careless it is also rather 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.160
 just likelihood big so fake 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.130
 need to be careful further the box is 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.530
 should be fully open if it 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.000
 opens completely is a good thing if 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.000
 the only way to open 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:28.760
 no further like this hack i said by 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.970
 about wire if round debt 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.450
 round wire doesn't make us like he 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.050
 there must be a flat 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.990
 you see further the plug bayonets should 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.840
 be here is 90 degrees straight 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.220
 monster beats does not produce plugs already 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.320
 since 2008 it seems like a year that's just right 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.729
 Now mostly such further 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:02.050
 the serial number is our viewer about 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:05.510
 need to be there by the very picture 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:11.000
 we if you just like her 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:14.150
 mirror then this is bad it should be 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.690
 with such as say such as ribbed 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.720
 something like this letter b should so not 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.580
 drawn in these straight printed 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:29.860
 finger touch it to feel as if 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:33.530
 lips here in principle on crafts it is a letter 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.580
 erased if rubbed 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.689
 not here 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.610
 everything is good all is well kept she 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.219
 instantly extends to just like that 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.680
 here is terantino erased 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:51.009
 I said headphones for a long time yes 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:57.629
 certainly can erase it all 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:06:00.490
 paint it all safe in principle 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.939
 let's look at the cover 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.710
 an interesting design is made and white too 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:11.050
 there is no letter their logo inside the case 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.690
 such a mesh headphone what 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.490
 it turns out well we can 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:21.639
 We can attach replaceable Well, you can have one pair 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.060
 put all of course you headphones are not 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:30.969
 fit well, basically, everything I wanted 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:34.810
 say these interesting 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:38.669
 headphones thanks for watching 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.469
 the next video will be in two weeks 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.500
 will be in another device 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.560
 Dad does not know his son, but it will not be 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.580
 headphones that's for sure everyone thanks for 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.580
