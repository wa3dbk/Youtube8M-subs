lesson we saw that one type of membrane

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.939 
lesson we saw that one type of membrane
protein<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> lipid<00:00:15.269> linked<00:00:15.660> protein<00:00:16.230> it's

one side of the bilayer or the other Sun

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
one side of the bilayer or the other Sun
may<00:00:25.710> also<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> transmembrane<00:00:26.849> region<00:00:27.750> but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
may also have a transmembrane region but

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.150 
may also have a transmembrane region but
this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:29.420> altogether<00:00:30.420> common<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.949> keep

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.080 
linked proteins in the figure on the
left<00:01:02.520> part<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.930> blue<00:01:04.140> portion<00:01:04.650> represents

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
left part a the blue portion represents

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
left part a the blue portion represents
an<00:01:06.090> amino<00:01:06.479> acid<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:07.229> chain<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> portion<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
an amino acid side chain or a portion of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.969 
an amino acid side chain or a portion of
a<00:01:08.430> protein<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.380> attached<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
a protein and to this we have attached a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.070 
a protein and to this we have attached a
lipid<00:01:11.400> anchor<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.180> case<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.689> simply<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
lipid anchor in this case it's simply a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.520 
lipid anchor in this case it's simply a
fatty<00:01:13.409> acid<00:01:13.920> chain<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.659> amide

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
fatty acid chain and so we have an amide

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.700 
fatty acid chain and so we have an amide
link<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.759> protein<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
link to our protein and the one on the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
link to our protein and the one on the
right<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.580> complicated<00:01:21.119> lipid

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
right we have a more complicated lipid

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.100 
right we have a more complicated lipid
anchor<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.430> case<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.450> series<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
anchor in this case we have a series of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
anchor in this case we have a series of
carbohydrate<00:01:26.100> residues<00:01:26.580> indicated<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
carbohydrate residues indicated by the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.109 
carbohydrate residues indicated by the
cyclic<00:01:27.960> structures<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.579> still<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.090> our

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
cyclic structures here we still have our

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.050 
cyclic structures here we still have our
protein<00:01:30.750> component<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.530> blue<00:01:31.890> -<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
simply a fatty acid chain one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
simply a fatty acid chain one
and<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:48.510> figure<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.830> lipid

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and the figure on the right our lipid

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
and the figure on the right our lipid
anchors<00:01:50.610> actually<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.180> phospholipid<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
anchors actually a phospholipid with a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.700 
anchors actually a phospholipid with a
carbohydrate<00:01:53.040> head<00:01:53.790> group<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:55.229> complex

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
carbohydrate head group a more complex

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.670 
carbohydrate head group a more complex
structure<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:57.659> each<00:01:57.960> case<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> blue

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
structure and in each case the blue

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
structure and in each case the blue
portion<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.580> part<00:02:00.270> where<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.659> connected<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
portion is part where it's connected to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.139 
portion is part where it's connected to
the<00:02:01.560> protein<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.580> see<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the protein so you can see that the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
the protein so you can see that the
anchors<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.570> vary<00:02:03.990> quite<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.799> terms<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
anchors can vary quite a bit in terms of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.730 
anchors can vary quite a bit in terms of
complexity<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.600> also<00:02:06.899> has<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.590> with

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
complexity and this also has to do with

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
complexity and this also has to do with
how<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.100> associate<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> membrane<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
how they associate with the membrane and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
how they associate with the membrane and
whether<00:02:10.350> they<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.619> associated<00:02:10.920> inside<00:02:11.850> or

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
whether they are associated inside or

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.559 
whether they are associated inside or
outside<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.080> membrane<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:15.239> fluid

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
outside of that membrane the fluid

outside of that membrane the fluid
mosaic<00:02:15.780> model<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.620> originally<00:02:16.739> described<00:02:17.550> by

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
mosaic model was originally described by

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.020 
mosaic model was originally described by
singer<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> Nicholson<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.280> 1972<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
singer and Nicholson in 1972 the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790 
singer and Nicholson in 1972 the
original<00:02:21.480> idea<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.380> membrane

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
original idea was that the membrane

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.729 
original idea was that the membrane
proteins<00:02:23.519> could<00:02:23.790> float<00:02:24.090> entirely<00:02:24.739> randomly

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
proteins could float entirely randomly

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.100 
proteins could float entirely randomly
in<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> sea<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.400> lipids<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.870> find

in the sea of lipids what we find

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
in the sea of lipids what we find
however<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.580> though<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.569> is

however is that that is though that is

however is that that is though that is
mostly<00:02:31.230> true<00:02:31.709> they're<00:02:32.280> not<00:02:32.310> entirely<00:02:33.060> free<00:02:33.630> to

their movement and that may be because

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
their movement and that may be because
they're<00:02:38.940> interacting<00:02:39.600> with<00:02:39.720> other<00:02:39.900> proteins

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
proteins that's what we have illustrated

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
proteins that's what we have illustrated
here<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.580> case<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.970> protein<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.810> it's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
here in the case of protein a it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.650 
here in the case of protein a it's
actually<00:02:49.799> attached<00:02:50.220> there's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.670> cytoskeleton

actually attached there's a cytoskeleton

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.289 
actually attached there's a cytoskeleton

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
and so it's entirely immobile it's fixed

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.569 
and so it's entirely immobile it's fixed
in<00:02:54.480> its<00:02:54.630> position<00:02:55.370> protein<00:02:56.370> B<00:02:56.610> however<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.810> is

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
in its position protein B however it is

in its position protein B however it is
encased<00:02:59.579> within<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.450> series<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
cytoskeletal proteins but it's mobile

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.960 
cytoskeletal proteins but it's mobile
within<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.810> small<00:03:04.019> area<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:05.430> might<00:03:05.640> think<00:03:05.880> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
within that small area we might think of

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.349 
within that small area we might think of
another<00:03:06.390> example<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.709> protein<00:03:08.250> C<00:03:08.730> that

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
another example of a protein C that

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.900 
another example of a protein C that
would<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.660> entirely<00:03:10.079> mobile<00:03:10.859> not<00:03:11.280> connected

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
would be entirely mobile not connected

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.910 
would be entirely mobile not connected
in<00:03:12.060> any<00:03:12.269> way<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:13.230> not<00:03:13.440> part<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.799> our

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
in any way and that's not part of our

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.400 
in any way and that's not part of our
illustration<00:03:14.609> here<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.510> point<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.019> remember

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
illustration here the point to remember

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.830 
illustration here the point to remember
is<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.980> these<00:03:17.340> proteins<00:03:18.000> interact<00:03:18.600> with

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
is that these proteins interact with

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.990 
is that these proteins interact with
other<00:03:19.140> proteins<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:19.920> components<00:03:20.549> within<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
other proteins and components within the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.090 
other proteins and components within the
cell<00:03:21.269> because<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.799> specific

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
cell because they have a specific

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.449 
cell because they have a specific
function<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.630> protein<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.350> requires<00:03:26.070> for

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
function so if protein a requires for

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.280 
function so if protein a requires for
its<00:03:26.489> function<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.390> be<00:03:27.510> attached<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
its function that it be attached to the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.860 
its function that it be attached to the
cytoskeleton<00:03:29.160> that's<00:03:29.760> why<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.209> localized

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
cytoskeleton that's why it's localized

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.460 
cytoskeleton that's why it's localized
to<00:03:31.109> that<00:03:31.290> area<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.160> B<00:03:32.760> functions<00:03:33.450> within<00:03:34.079> that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
to that area if B functions within that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.220 
to that area if B functions within that
outlined<00:03:35.340> area<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.359> needs<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.870> mobile

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
outlined area but it needs to be mobile

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.560 
outlined area but it needs to be mobile
within<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.920> area<00:03:38.340> that's<00:03:38.910> why<00:03:39.299> it's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
within that area that's why it's

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.309 
within that area that's why it's
structured<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.670> connected<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.880> way<00:03:42.319> so

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
structured and connected in that way so

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.229 
structured and connected in that way so
we<00:03:43.440> find<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.890> proteins<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.640> well<00:03:44.850> as<00:03:45.000> lipids

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
we find that proteins as well as lipids

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.880 
we find that proteins as well as lipids
may<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:46.010> asymmetrical<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
may be asymmetrical in the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.270 
may be asymmetrical in the
brain<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.870> concludes<00:03:50.410> our<00:03:50.560> studies<00:03:51.040> in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
we considered in this chapter allow us

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.440 
we considered in this chapter allow us
to<00:04:05.080> vary<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> concentration<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.459> ions<00:04:06.670> both

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
to vary the concentration of ions both

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.740 
to vary the concentration of ions both
inside<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.020> outside<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.890> cell<00:04:09.240> we<00:04:10.240> also<00:04:10.390> want

inside and outside the cell we also want

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.170 
inside and outside the cell we also want
to<00:04:10.810> see<00:04:11.050> how<00:04:11.080> these<00:04:11.470> ion<00:04:11.950> gradients<00:04:12.550> allow<00:04:13.000> us
