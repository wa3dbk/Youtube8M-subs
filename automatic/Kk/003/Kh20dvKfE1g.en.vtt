00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.420
 that our skin works 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.610

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.620

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.220
 here we will right click to the first 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.220
 folder option and open with winrar 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.580
 here we go to the assets folder 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.070
 then the minecraft folder after the 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.370
 textures folder and then the folder in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.710
 and we're going to erase it but I show you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.690

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.890
 to erase the go by the image or skin 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.460
 that we download and replace it with the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460
 that we erase 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.000
 well now I'm going to make sure 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.570
 have put the minecraft skin that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.570
 I downloaded 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 note when we open the mini craft not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.570
 have the internet on to avoid 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.979
 lose the skin since the mini craft 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.860
 updates the version in which the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 we install good and I show you my skin 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.590
