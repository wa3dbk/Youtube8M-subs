00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.680
 with it is twelve o'clock at night and the high-pressure sodium lamp has been 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.590
 paid out 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.500
 the difference now that we have monochromatic light the activity also of 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.509
 the city to let reduce has been reduced 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.759
 and good not to him 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.380
 one as I often say that for example that when you change this 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.009
 non-promising smoke lighting 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
 they change the colors the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.360
 after the side turn off they become black car 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.629
 when they leave the restaurant they just call the police saying that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.980
 can not find your car 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.490
 These areas of the Canary Island have been protected since 1988 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.760
 and its purpose is to guarantee scientific activity from the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.900
 astronomical observatories 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.880
 in the island of the palm is the observatory of the rock of the boys 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.240
 one of the most complete sets of telescopes in the world 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.340
 the place is above the sea of ​​clouds at 2 thousand 400 meters above the level 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.190
 from sea 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 where thanks to the trade winds the atmosphere is stable and very transparent 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.110
 here geography and climate come together to provide conditions 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 exceptional for astronomical observation 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.810
 This morning Javier Díaz accompanies us to the Ecuadorians to show us 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 some of the benefits they get thanks to pollution control 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160
 light 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 we arrived at the residence of the observatory 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.840
 Juan Carlos Perez is the administrator of the observatory 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 this facility that was inaugurated in 1985 has the highest concentration of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 European telescopes located in the northern hemisphere 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.210
 That goes without saying 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 at this time in these conservatory facilities 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 with all thirteen other telescopes 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.840
 which belong to the same country 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.030
 different 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.659
 will join in it aa work 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.180
 more than 50 scientific institutions 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.580
 percent and mainly European 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.170
 percent and tonight for example we have in the show salvatore ocón 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.839
 the 35 7 and cisco people indicated 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.829
 percent and they will develop everything to a series of conservation projects 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.719
 percent and that they will later take to their own centers 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.639
 and will process that information for 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.639
 to the scientific result 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.089
 a sample of the exceptional observation conditions that 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.859
 they provide skies of the islands 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.719
 we have it in this building 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.590
 It is the great Canary telescope that is still in phase 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.859
 of installation of its sophisticated instruments 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.019
 but when it goes into operation it will be the largest telescope in the world 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.469
 the astrophysicist pedro álvarez is its director 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.569
 a scientist hopeful to be able to face with this telescope the biggest 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.609
 challenges of current astronomy 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.079
 with this telescope 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.719
 to try 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.769
 attack 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.459
 basic and fundamental problems that arise this among others 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.219
 among many 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.799
 the origin and evolution of the universe 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.490
 the birth of the fraction 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.869
 we want to see very far 2 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.539
 because see very far I'm an expert 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:38.929
 back in time 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.099
 we want to arrive 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.219
 host start of training
