00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.810
 Ministry of Defense refuses to hand 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 this is an overclocking block of this light 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.859
 carrier rocket collected in Kharkov 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 we are heading for an import substitution 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.639
 this said plisetsky where with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.590
 check came Sergei Shoigu Maxim 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 Gritsenko heard the most important military 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 news first working trip after 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 launch rocket hangar 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 started by inspecting spaceport facilities where 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.000
 the carrier is already being prepared for launch 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.130
 heavier class hangar rocket again 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 several times as powerful 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 its predecessor is mounting 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.340
 trial facility a month ago 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 modules of the newest were delivered 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 heavy and launch vehicle launch 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 which is scheduled for the end of this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 years, however, today it became known 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 what's in the ministry of defense 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.190
 abandoned booster roar in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.610
 which use Ukrainian 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 component hand-off this is not related 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 just because the booster of this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.120
 generations are completed with composite 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.829
 parts of the production of Ukraine although it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.619
 also one of the main reasons 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 Rumble works on a poisonous environmentally 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 dangerous bending or while hangar 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 enters orbit using oxygen 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.049
 hydrogen engine ministry 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 defenses against the roar decided to abandon 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.210
 favor of purely Russian launch vehicles 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 rocket point their hands next slide 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.869
 she has on her construction from 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.479
 parts manufactured at plants of Ukraine 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.650
 and today this cube and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.630
 environmental how we call it next 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.270
 that is, uses 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.329
 heptyl at today's ministry 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.780
 defense can complete all its tasks 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.970
 on our light alliances union two stages 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.679
 one for which we checked in December 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.450
 preparation and launch of non-space and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.179
 rocket public lightweight hangar 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 12 who is also with me in the hangar alone 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.439
 giving after year she ask herself only 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.810
 the extraction is closed so accurately combat 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.179
 the calculation that made the start 1 hangar with 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.159
 Plesetsk Cosmodrome in full force 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.679
 here everybody is sure about modern 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.020
 booster safer easier and yes 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.429
 more powerful than foreign analogues starting 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.399
 table built in plesetsk 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.799
 universal any types of payloads 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.920
 hangar can lead out of the plesez outside 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.790
 depending on the state of affairs on 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.250
 leased baikonur 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.160
 you were able to master in a short time 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.519
 the hardest technique and taught our hangar 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 fly actually demonstrated that 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.799
 Russia is capable of its territory 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.250
 provide independent guaranteed 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.620
 access 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 outer space especially 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.700
 distinguished themselves when launching light hangars 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.709
 the defense minister awarded medals for 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.720
 military prowess pretty stayed 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.760
 minister and built in plesetsk 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.120
 modern sports and fitness 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.329
 complex sauna cafe aquapark and even 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.030
 bowling will open it this fall at 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.299
 book of honorary guests of the museum 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.609
 aerospace forces 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.430
 the minister of defense left thanks 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.799
 Record a good memory of his visitors
