first<00:00:00.930> things<00:00:01.140> first<00:00:01.230> let's<00:00:01.770> talk<00:00:01.949> about<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
first things first let's talk about the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.789 
first things first let's talk about the
long<00:00:02.610> roll<00:00:02.929> what<00:00:03.929> I'm<00:00:03.990> gonna<00:00:04.080> demonstrate<00:00:04.290> is

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
long roll what I'm gonna demonstrate is

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.230 
long roll what I'm gonna demonstrate is
a<00:00:04.830> long<00:00:05.130> roll<00:00:05.370> breakdown<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.089> that's

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
a long roll breakdown and that's

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.810 
a long roll breakdown and that's
basically<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.870> slow<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:08.010> fast<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.639> slow

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
basically a slow to fast to slow

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.570 
basically a slow to fast to slow
approach<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.139> long<00:00:10.349> roll<00:00:10.650> now<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.490> I'm

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
approach for the long roll now what I'm

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.669 
approach for the long roll now what I'm
gonna<00:00:11.670> focus<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.650> consistency<00:00:13.650> of

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
gonna focus on here is consistency of

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.860 
gonna focus on here is consistency of
sound<00:00:14.280> okay<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.969> don't<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.210> care<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.599> fast

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
sound okay I don't really care how fast

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.750 
sound okay I don't really care how fast
I<00:00:16.049> get<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> want<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I get but all I want to know is that it

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
I get but all I want to know is that it
sounds<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> same<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.600> beginning<00:00:18.920> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
sounds the same at the beginning the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:01:12.610 
sounds the same at the beginning the
middle<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.340> at<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> end<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.140> go

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.340 

now<00:01:13.620> my<00:01:13.980> focus<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:15.320> consistency<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
now my focus for that was consistency of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.860 
now my focus for that was consistency of
sound<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:17.730> when<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.060> practicing<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
sound so now when you're practicing this

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.870 
sound so now when you're practicing this
and<00:01:19.140> learning<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:19.980> to<00:01:20.040> break<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.640> role

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and learning how to break down your role

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
and learning how to break down your role
and<00:01:21.090> play<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.540> roles<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.900> any<00:01:22.140> tempo<00:01:22.710> which

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and play your roles at any tempo which

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
and play your roles at any tempo which
is<00:01:23.010> what<00:01:23.160> this<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.400> teach<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.200> focus<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
is what this will teach you focus on

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410 
is what this will teach you focus on
your<00:01:25.500> consistency<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.250> sound<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
your consistency of sound now when I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
your consistency of sound now when I
start<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> play<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.770> faster

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
start to play and get a little faster

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730 
start to play and get a little faster
there's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> transition<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.660> stroking<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
there's a transition from stroking the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's a transition from stroking the
notes<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.520> bouncing<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
notes out to bouncing and that's when a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.150 
notes out to bouncing and that's when a
lot<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> people<00:01:34.020> change<00:01:34.440> their<00:01:34.590> sounds<00:01:35.010> so

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
lot of people change their sounds so

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.340 
lot of people change their sounds so
something<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.630 

hear<00:01:42.350> how<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.469> sound<00:01:42.590> changes<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.429> little

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
hear how the sound changes just a little

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.880 
hear how the sound changes just a little
bit<00:01:43.759> right<00:01:43.789> there<00:01:43.939> okay<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.289> when<00:01:45.770> that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
bit right there okay so when that

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.800 
bit right there okay so when that
happens<00:01:46.369> be<00:01:46.670> very<00:01:46.909> aware<00:01:47.030> with<00:01:47.329> your<00:01:47.509> ears

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
happens be very aware with your ears

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.419 
happens be very aware with your ears
that<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.049> hear<00:01:48.469> that<00:01:48.679> hear<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.310> little

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
that you hear that hear that little

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.190 
that you hear that hear that little
sound<00:01:49.670> change<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.240> then<00:01:50.569> just<00:01:50.780> sort<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:50.990> back

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
sound change and then just sort of back

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.870 
sound change and then just sort of back
up<00:01:51.439> a<00:01:51.530> little<00:01:51.619> bit<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.369> you're<00:01:52.520> actually<00:01:52.789> going

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
up a little bit so you're actually going

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.179 
up a little bit so you're actually going
to<00:01:52.939> practice<00:01:53.390> sort<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.719> both<00:01:54.200> tempos<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.069> a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
to practice sort of both tempos in a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:10.199 
to practice sort of both tempos in a
sense<00:01:55.459> so<00:01:55.549> it'll<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.729> something<00:01:55.969> like<00:01:56.090> this

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.339 

okay<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.269> you've<00:02:11.480> sort<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.720> taken<00:02:12.079> two<00:02:12.290> steps

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
okay so you've sort of taken two steps

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.380 
okay so you've sort of taken two steps
forward<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.250> step<00:02:13.519> back<00:02:13.819> in<00:02:14.120> order<00:02:14.269> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
forward and then a step back in order to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.380 
forward and then a step back in order to
really<00:02:14.930> maximize<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.890> consistency<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.030> sound

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
really maximize the consistency of sound

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.130 
really maximize the consistency of sound
as<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:18.049> relates<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.500> roll<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.870> for

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
as it relates to that roll now for

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.289 
as it relates to that roll now for
isolating<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> strokes<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.459> your<00:02:22.579> roll<00:02:22.790> we're

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
isolating the strokes of your roll we're

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.640 
isolating the strokes of your roll we're
just<00:02:23.450> going<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.599> use<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> standard<00:02:24.170> double<00:02:24.500> beat

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
just going to use a standard double beat

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.220 
just going to use a standard double beat
exercise<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.430> exercise<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.390> this

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.809 

now<00:02:33.230> there's<00:02:33.410> two<00:02:33.620> variations<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.640> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
now there's two variations you can do to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.130 
now there's two variations you can do to
that<00:02:34.940> double<00:02:35.239> beat<00:02:35.360> exercise<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.049> help

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
that double beat exercise to help

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.960 
that double beat exercise to help
compensate<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.829> whatever<00:02:37.190> deficiency<00:02:37.879> you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
compensate for whatever deficiency you

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.539 
compensate for whatever deficiency you
may<00:02:38.120> have<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.569> your<00:02:38.780> dentals<00:02:39.200> first<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.069> is<00:02:40.250> to

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
may have in your dentals first one is to

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.059 
may have in your dentals first one is to
accent<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.329> first<00:02:41.569> note

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.920 

okay<00:02:48.069> that's<00:02:48.790> very<00:02:48.909> helpful<00:02:49.510> if<00:02:49.659> you're

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
okay that's very helpful if you're

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.380 
okay that's very helpful if you're
somebody<00:02:50.230> who<00:02:50.769> plays<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.250> role<00:02:51.549> like<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:54.390> sort

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
somebody who plays a role like this sort

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.300 
somebody who plays a role like this sort
of<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.810> plays<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.530> second<00:02:57.010> note<00:02:57.099> you

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
of over plays that that second note you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.770 
of over plays that that second note you
can<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.609> compensate<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.299> play<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.569> first

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
can then compensate and play the first

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.630 
can then compensate and play the first
note<00:02:58.870> louder<00:02:59.200> now<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.890> other<00:03:00.099> one<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.519> then

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
