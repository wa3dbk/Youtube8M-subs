started off with like a square box cut

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.690 
started off with like a square box cut
it<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:28.020> size<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:29.610> order

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it up into like about my size in order

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.080 
it up into like about my size in order
to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:31.340> fast<00:01:32.340> enough<00:01:32.640> since

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to get it like the fast enough since

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
to get it like the fast enough since
it's<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> slope<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:34.350> did<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> big<00:01:34.770> wheels

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's like a slope we did the big wheels

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.210 
it's like a slope we did the big wheels
in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.190> smaller<00:01:36.030> wheels<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> front

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
in the back smaller wheels in the front

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
in the back smaller wheels in the front
and<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.340> put<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.700> backbone<00:01:39.270> hunt<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.660> so

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and we put like a backbone hunt here so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.779 
and we put like a backbone hunt here so
get<00:01:39.960> support<00:01:40.289> my<00:01:40.470> weight<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.310> first<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
get support my weight well at first it

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.570 
get support my weight well at first it
was<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:41.940> me<00:01:42.240> alone<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:44.039> kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> went<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
was just me alone it kind of went a

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.609 
was just me alone it kind of went a
pretty<00:01:45.179> bad<00:01:45.360> since<00:01:45.660> our<00:01:45.869> car<00:01:46.050> goes<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
pretty bad since our car goes to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.339 
pretty bad since our car goes to the
left<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.030> after<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:48.840> pushed<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
left but then after we pushed it and

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.240 
left but then after we pushed it and
made<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.800> changes<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:51.349> to<00:01:52.349> the<00:01:52.380> angle<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
made some changes to the to the angle of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
made some changes to the to the angle of
the<00:01:53.310> car<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:53.970> much<00:01:54.060> came<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> first

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.780 

yeah<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.970> always<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.420> record
