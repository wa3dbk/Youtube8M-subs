the<00:00:10.889> previous<00:00:11.099> tutorials<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.570> seen<00:00:12.870> how

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the previous tutorials we have seen how

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.740 
the previous tutorials we have seen how
we<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.230> neatly<00:00:13.710> relay<00:00:14.549> track<00:00:14.910> drive<00:00:15.389> around

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
we can neatly relay track drive around

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
we can neatly relay track drive around
with<00:00:16.020> three<00:00:16.410> trains<00:00:16.770> even<00:00:16.980> without<00:00:17.430> having

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
with three trains even without having

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.290 
with three trains even without having
them<00:00:18.180> collide<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.260> used<00:00:19.529> signals

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
them collide because we used signals

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
them collide because we used signals
let's<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:21.480> use<00:00:21.590> put<00:00:22.590> all<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.949> knowledge<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
let's now use put all this knowledge to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.480 
let's now use put all this knowledge to
the<00:00:23.910> test<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> create<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> larger<00:00:25.800> layout<00:00:26.220> with

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the test and create a larger layout with

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.080 
the test and create a larger layout with
more<00:00:26.820> trains<00:00:28.039> in<00:00:29.039> another<00:00:29.340> program<00:00:30.060> called

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
more trains in another program called

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.709 
more trains in another program called

EEP Aizen ban I once created this demo
of<00:00:33.899> layout<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> let's<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> recreate<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of layout and let's try to recreate this

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.770 
of layout and let's try to recreate this
in<00:00:37.410> trains<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> South<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.540> have

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
in trains over here at the South we have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
in trains over here at the South we have
a<00:00:39.989> large<00:00:40.350> station<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.399> at<00:00:41.550> least<00:00:41.790> four

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
tracks our first passenger trains and I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.900 
tracks our first passenger trains and I
go<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.210> North<00:00:48.600> Station<00:00:49.370> let's<00:00:50.370> suggest<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
go to a North Station let's suggest the

inner track as well as the outer track

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
inner track as well as the outer track
our<00:00:53.520> freight<00:00:53.940> trains<00:00:54.390> industrial<00:00:55.110> trains<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
our freight trains industrial trains and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
our freight trains industrial trains and
I<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> outer<00:00:57.000> track<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.809> able<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
I want the outer track to be able to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
I want the outer track to be able to
also<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> inner<00:01:00.090> track<00:01:00.420> train<00:01:01.550> ok<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
also go to the inner track train ok this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.990 
also go to the inner track train ok this

that<00:01:06.119> goes<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> video<00:01:07.729> let<00:01:08.729> us<00:01:08.909> open<00:01:09.150> up

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that goes with the video let us open up

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.590 
that goes with the video let us open up
the<00:01:09.840> program<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.119> can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the program and have a look if we can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
the program and have a look if we can
create<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.830> least<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.220> inner<00:01:14.460> loop<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
create at least the inner loop so that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.929 
create at least the inner loop so that
we<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> reference<00:01:16.229> point<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.820> next

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
we have a reference point for the next

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.030 
we have a reference point for the next
tutorial

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
tutorial

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
tutorial
let's<00:01:20.040> click<00:01:20.250> routes<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.299> create<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.110> new

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
let's click routes and that create a new

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.640 
let's click routes and that create a new
route<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.990> give<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.470> name<00:01:25.650> project<00:01:26.610> 1<00:01:28.970> ok<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
route we give it a name project 1 ok and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
route we give it a name project 1 ok and
then<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> real<00:01:32.340> scale<00:01:32.670> metric<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.540> all

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
then the real scale metric that's all

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.249 
then the real scale metric that's all
fine<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.970> hit<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> arrow<00:01:36.450> key<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:37.049> keyboard

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
fine I hit the arrow key on my keyboard

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
fine I hit the arrow key on my keyboard
to<00:01:37.590> tilt<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.729> thing<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.119> notice<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to tilt and the first thing I notice is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
to tilt and the first thing I notice is
that<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.439> weird<00:01:40.680> reason<00:01:40.829> North<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.729> not

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that for some weird reason North is not

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
that for some weird reason North is not
north<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> also<00:01:43.049> hit<00:01:43.409> another<00:01:43.680> arrow<00:01:44.009> key

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
north so I also hit another arrow key

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.389 
north so I also hit another arrow key
and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.970> shift<00:01:45.299> arrow<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.960> rotate<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and then shift arrow to rotate it so

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.569 
and then shift arrow to rotate it so
that<00:01:47.430> North<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> north<00:01:48.950> let's<00:01:49.950> keep<00:01:50.130> things

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that North is north let's keep things

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.499 
that North is north let's keep things
neat<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> tidy

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
neat and tidy

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.920 
neat and tidy
I<00:01:51.689> click<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.610> toolbox<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.880> laying<00:01:54.299> track<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
I click the toolbox for laying track and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.060 
I click the toolbox for laying track and
I<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.040> search<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.790> FM<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
I would like to search for the FM a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.670 
I would like to search for the FM a
track<00:01:59.180> yes<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.170> number<00:02:02.149> 38<00:02:03.469> that's<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.339 
last one are laid them all in the same
direction<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.950> don't<00:02:48.819> know<00:02:49.090> why<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.810> go

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
direction I don't know why but I go

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.970 
direction I don't know why but I go
counterclockwise<00:02:51.540> throughout<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.750> whole

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
counterclockwise throughout the whole

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.110 
counterclockwise throughout the whole
layout<00:02:53.980> okay

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
layout okay

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.150 
layout okay
this<00:02:55.329> is<00:02:55.480> done<00:02:55.829> let's<00:02:56.829> do<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.549> inner<00:02:57.819> oval<00:02:58.810> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
this is done let's do the inner oval and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.610 
this is done let's do the inner oval and
let's<00:03:00.160> say<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.370> we<00:03:00.790> want<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.180> radius<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
let's say that we want a radius of the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
let's say that we want a radius of the
turnout<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.849> curve<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.599> 50<00:03:05.230> 500<00:03:05.980> meters<00:03:06.579> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
turnout of the curve of 50 500 meters so

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.530 
turnout of the curve of 50 500 meters so
let's<00:03:08.049> click<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.500> over<00:03:08.829> here<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.250> then<00:03:09.489> 1<00:03:09.819> 2<00:03:10.180> 3

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
let's click it over here and then 1 2 3

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.009 
let's click it over here and then 1 2 3

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
4 5 1 2 3 4 5 that's okay let's put it

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.610 
4 5 1 2 3 4 5 that's okay let's put it
off<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:17.639> then<00:03:18.639> we<00:03:18.910> go<00:03:19.090> back<00:03:19.980> 1<00:03:20.980> 2<00:03:21.459> 3<00:03:22.120> 4<00:03:22.780> 5<00:03:23.200> and

off there then we go back 1 2 3 4 5 and
1<00:03:24.489> 2<00:03:24.970> 3<00:03:25.170> 4<00:03:26.170> 5<00:03:26.680> ok<00:03:27.609> that's<00:03:27.940> roughly<00:03:28.540> okay<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:30.010> let

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
1 2 3 4 5 ok that's roughly okay now let

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.309 
1 2 3 4 5 ok that's roughly okay now let
us<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.760> look<00:03:31.030> zoom<00:03:31.389> out<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.690> bit<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
us have a look zoom out a bit with the

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.309 
us have a look zoom out a bit with the
mouse<00:03:32.500> wheel<00:03:32.530> where<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.280> are<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.900> we<00:03:35.049> can

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
mouse wheel where we are so that we can

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.569 
mouse wheel where we are so that we can
go<00:03:35.650> straight<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.579> end<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.319> same

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
go straight and end up at the same

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.849 
go straight and end up at the same
location<00:03:39.579> as<00:03:39.760> over<00:03:40.209> here<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> yeah<00:03:41.590> that

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
location as over here that is yeah that

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.270 
location as over here that is yeah that
is<00:03:42.010> correct<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.730> now<00:03:43.599> we<00:03:43.660> make<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.500> end

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
is correct and now we make this end

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.159 
is correct and now we make this end
curved<00:03:45.609> but<00:03:46.000> now<00:03:46.180> we<00:03:46.239> don't<00:03:46.510> have<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.959> go<00:03:47.109> to

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
curved but now we don't have to go to

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.379 
curved but now we don't have to go to
this<00:03:47.769> one<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.190> remember<00:03:48.700> form<00:03:48.940> from<00:03:49.239> the

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
this one I remember form from the

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.589 
this one I remember form from the
picture<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.130> we<00:03:51.130> are<00:03:51.340> now<00:03:51.519> going<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:52.030> this

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
picture that we are now going to this

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.330 
picture that we are now going to this
Lane<00:03:53.109> 2<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.730> radius<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.359> now<00:03:55.560> 55<00:03:56.560> instead<00:03:57.190> of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
Lane 2 so my radius is now 55 instead of

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.289 
Lane 2 so my radius is now 55 instead of
50<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.079> little<00:03:59.440> bit<00:03:59.590> more<00:03:59.880> okay<00:04:00.880> let's<00:04:01.150> do

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
50 just a little bit more okay let's do

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:01.680 
50 just a little bit more okay let's do
it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.280

whoops<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.190> bad<00:04:09.549> 5<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:10.720> 1/2<00:04:10.870> somewhere

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
whoops that is bad 5 and 1/2 somewhere

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.080 
whoops that is bad 5 and 1/2 somewhere
over<00:04:11.889> here<00:04:11.919> we<00:04:12.880> will<00:04:13.090> do<00:04:13.389> the<00:04:13.599> accuracy<00:04:14.230> later

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
over here we will do the accuracy later

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.569 
over here we will do the accuracy later
ok<00:04:16.090> let's<00:04:16.450> now<00:04:16.630> connect<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.950> track

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
ok let's now connect it to this track

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.390 
ok let's now connect it to this track
number<00:04:19.120> 2<00:04:19.329> let's<00:04:20.229> hope<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.590> connects<00:04:20.919> yes<00:04:21.190> it

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
number 2 let's hope it connects yes it

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.170 
number 2 let's hope it connects yes it
does<00:04:21.849> and<00:04:22.469> we<00:04:23.469> can<00:04:23.830> straighten<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.669> track

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
does and we can straighten this track

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.620 
does and we can straighten this track
well<00:04:25.360> let's<00:04:25.599> try<00:04:25.870> them<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:26.260> all

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
well let's try them then all

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.490 
well let's try them then all
why<00:04:27.290> not<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.370> one<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.990> probably<00:04:29.990> here

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
why not and this one and probably here

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.290 
why not and this one and probably here
on<00:04:30.650> top<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.190> one<00:04:31.370> needs<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.000> straightened

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
on top that one needs to be straightened

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.050 
on top that one needs to be straightened
too<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:33.410> remember<00:04:34.010> from<00:04:34.220> an<00:04:34.460> earlier<00:04:34.520> tutorial

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
too we remember from an earlier tutorial

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.990 
too we remember from an earlier tutorial
to<00:04:35.660> get<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.900> perfect<00:04:36.500> circle<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:37.610> need<00:04:37.850> to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
to get a perfect circle you need to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.080 
to get a perfect circle you need to
insert<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.900> few<00:04:39.290> splines<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:39.980> let's<00:04:40.220> insert<00:04:40.760> a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
insert a few splines so let's insert a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.960 
insert a few splines so let's insert a
spline<00:04:41.510> over<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.000> over<00:04:44.000> here<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.420> also

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
spline over here and over here and also

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.710 
spline over here and over here and also
over<00:04:46.970> here<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.050> over<00:04:48.350> here<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.570> let's<00:04:50.570> not

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
over here and over here and let's not

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.850 
over here and over here and let's not
tidy<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.320> up<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.740> click<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.250> move<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.860> then

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
tidy it up so I click the move and then

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.370 
tidy it up so I click the move and then
we<00:04:55.100> see<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:56.300> get<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.570> better<00:04:56.930> idea<00:04:57.080> of

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
we see that to get a better idea of

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.590 
we see that to get a better idea of
circle<00:04:57.890> we<00:04:57.980> have<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.310> move<00:04:58.520> them<00:04:58.790> out<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.390> little

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
circle we have to move them out a little

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.530 
circle we have to move them out a little
bit<00:04:59.870> so<00:04:59.900> let's<00:05:00.500> do<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:01.040> by<00:05:01.310> eye<00:05:01.610> we<00:05:02.030> could<00:05:02.300> use

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
bit so let's do it by eye we could use

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.030 
bit so let's do it by eye we could use
the<00:05:02.750> ruler<00:05:03.170> we<00:05:03.320> have<00:05:03.470> seen<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:03.920> another

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
the ruler we have seen in another

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.880 
the ruler we have seen in another
tutorial<00:05:04.310> how<00:05:04.880> we<00:05:05.060> could<00:05:05.450> do<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.680> but<00:05:06.680> that's

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
tutorial how we could do that but that's

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.660 
tutorial how we could do that but that's
too<00:05:07.250> much<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.910> job<00:05:08.330> right<00:05:08.570> now<00:05:08.960> we<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:10.490> do

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
too much of a job right now we just do

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.910 
too much of a job right now we just do
it<00:05:10.820> by<00:05:11.030> looking<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.970> making<00:05:13.970> ourselves

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
it by looking and making ourselves

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.240 
it by looking and making ourselves
visually<00:05:16.150> satisfied<00:05:17.150> okay<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.250> I

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
visually satisfied okay I like this I

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.910 
visually satisfied okay I like this I
see<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.180> my<00:05:20.360> timer<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:21.050> we<00:05:21.260> used<00:05:21.530> five

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
see on my timer that we used five

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.130 
see on my timer that we used five
minutes<00:05:22.400> for<00:05:22.640> this<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.090> let's<00:05:23.360> stop<00:05:23.900> this

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
minutes for this so let's stop this

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.710 
minutes for this so let's stop this
tutorial<00:05:24.680> here<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.130> let's<00:05:25.370> create<00:05:25.790> the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
tutorial here and let's create the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.790 
tutorial here and let's create the
second<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.920> passenger<00:05:28.490> train<00:05:28.700> inner<00:05:29.330> loops

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
second the passenger train inner loops

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.260 
second the passenger train inner loops
and<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:31.070> next<00:05:31.340> tutorial<00:05:31.790> see<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.150> over<00:05:32.360> there

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.090 

yes<00:05:38.300> let's<00:05:38.720> save<00:05:39.170> project<00:05:39.920> one<00:05:40.520> okay
