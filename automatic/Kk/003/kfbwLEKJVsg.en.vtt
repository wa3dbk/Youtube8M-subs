Soho imagery and you can see at the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.950 
Soho imagery and you can see at the
bottom<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> Sun<00:00:08.550> there's<00:00:08.940> an<00:00:09.210> object<00:00:09.630> very

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
bottom of the Sun there's an object very

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.259 
bottom of the Sun there's an object very
steadily<00:00:10.320> headed<00:00:10.830> towards<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.429> Sun<00:00:11.759> just

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
steadily headed towards the Sun just

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.140 
steadily headed towards the Sun just
like<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> comment<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.650> May<00:00:14.070> tenth<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.940> one

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
like the comment on May tenth this one

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.620 
like the comment on May tenth this one
doesn't<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.379> simultaneous<00:00:17.130> CM<00:00:17.850> e<00:00:18.000> after

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
doesn't have a simultaneous CM e after

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.429 
doesn't have a simultaneous CM e after
it<00:00:18.779> hits<00:00:19.050> though<00:00:19.640> it<00:00:20.640> does<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.840> straight<00:00:22.260> into

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it hits though it does go straight into

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
it hits though it does go straight into
the<00:00:22.560> Sun<00:00:22.859> at<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> bottom<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.619> can<00:00:26.210> see<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the Sun at the bottom and can see that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.710 
the Sun at the bottom and can see that
slowed<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> down<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
slowed it down a little bit and so it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
slowed it down a little bit and so it
disappears<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> Sun<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.219> another

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
disappears into the Sun and then another

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
disappears into the Sun and then another
object<00:00:32.940> appears<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> Sun

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
object appears to the right of the Sun

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.959 
object appears to the right of the Sun
just<00:00:35.190> above<00:00:36.860> there<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
just above there you go you can see that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
just above there you go you can see that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
object appearing I'm not sure what that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
object appearing I'm not sure what that
is<00:00:40.710> I'd<00:00:41.100> love<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.700> anybody<00:00:42.180> knows

is I'd love to know if anybody knows
exactly<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> object<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> it's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
exactly what that object is and it's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.750 
exactly what that object is and it's
that<00:00:45.000> object<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> appear<00:00:46.760> within

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that object is going to appear within

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.970 
that object is going to appear within
this<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.300> short<00:00:48.809> time<00:00:49.110> frame<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this very short time frame here on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.420 
this very short time frame here on the
other<00:00:50.190> side<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> Sun<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> left<00:00:52.430> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
other side of the Sun on the left it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
other side of the Sun on the left it
will<00:00:53.550> appear<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.660> second<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
will appear in just a second there it is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
will appear in just a second there it is
and<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> same<00:00:57.510> object<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and you can see it's the same object it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.790 
and you can see it's the same object it
appears<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> left<00:00:58.920> and<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
appears on the left and just a lot of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
appears on the left and just a lot of
activity<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> Sun<00:01:03.210> I've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
activity going on around the Sun I've

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.109 
activity going on around the Sun I've
really<00:01:03.750> been<00:01:03.930> watching<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> trying<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
really been watching and trying to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
really been watching and trying to
differentiate<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.110> I'd<00:01:07.470> love<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.010> somebody

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
to post a really detailed description of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
to post a really detailed description of
the<00:01:12.180> different<00:01:12.540> elements<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.350> are

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the different elements that are

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.080 
the different elements that are
interacting<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> Sun<00:01:14.880> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
interacting around the Sun because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
interacting around the Sun because
there's<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.540> many<00:01:15.720> different<00:01:15.990> objects<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
there's so many different objects and a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's so many different objects and a
lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> people<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.369> speculating<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
lot of people are speculating so now you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.420 
lot of people are speculating so now you
can<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.170> reversed<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> film<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> see

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
can see I reversed the film you can see

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980 
can see I reversed the film you can see
that<00:01:20.580> object<00:01:20.909> again<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> left<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> then

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that object again on the left and then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
that object again on the left and then
you're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> appear<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you're going to see it appear there on

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.690 
you're going to see it appear there on
the<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.509> Sun<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the right of the Sun and I know that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149 
the right of the Sun and I know that
that's<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> figment<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.500> or<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.829> an

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that's not a figment you know or just an

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
that's not a figment you know or just an
aberration<00:01:29.430> by<00:01:29.909> any<00:01:30.090> means<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.750> i'm<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.290> sure

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
aberration by any means but i'm not sure

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
aberration by any means but i'm not sure
what<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> can't<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
what it is and i know it can't be a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
what it is and i know it can't be a
planet<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.490> because<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.790> moved

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
planet that we know of because it moved

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280 
planet that we know of because it moved
too<00:01:36.180> quickly<00:01:36.450> within<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:37.259> frame

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
too quickly within that time frame

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.740 
too quickly within that time frame
around<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> Sun<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.630> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
around the Sun but so now it's in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
around the Sun but so now it's in
reverse<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> comet<00:01:41.360> what

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
reverse and you can see the comet what

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
reverse and you can see the comet what
I'm<00:01:42.479> calling<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> comet<00:01:43.380> come<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:44.009> from<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I'm calling a comet come back from the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
I'm calling a comet come back from the
Sun<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.759> there's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> objects<00:01:45.810> moving

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
Sun so there's a lot of objects moving

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020 
Sun so there's a lot of objects moving
around<00:01:46.350> quickly<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.700> one's<00:01:47.909> very

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
