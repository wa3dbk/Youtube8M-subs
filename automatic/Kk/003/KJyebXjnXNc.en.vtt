 Good. There's time for pumpkin pies, apples and cookies 

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:10.157
 which is probably why this pin collects a lot of attention these days. 

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:14.307
 This was designed by InternetFad, Lena, Candace, MD Jester, and many more of you 

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:20.631
 It is a delicate, delicious, shimmering Jolly Ranchery coated sugar apple 

00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.949
 which you can easily create by melting some Jolly Rancher candy and adding edible glitter 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.891
 Well, it looks like a delicious taste. I chose a few apples, a packet of sticks, 

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.029
 a small bowl that I can put in the oven and a ton of Jolly Ranchers candy 

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:38.556
 and finally some edible glitter. At first I mistook my apple and put my stick into it ... 

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:44.163
 That sounded strange. I just put the stick in the apple. Next I unpacked Jolly Ranchers 

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:48.935
 And I put them in my bowl, which, as described, I put in my oven at 250 degrees. 

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:53.144
 After 10 minutes and without much progress in melting, I raised the temperature to 350. 

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:57.474
 Fifteen minutes later, I had a hot, bubbling bowl of Jolly Rancher Syrup. 

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.420
 This is the time when I took edible glitter and mixed it all together. Let's talk about the edible glitter 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.561
 It's a mixture of crap, whether it's edible shine, sparkle, sparkle, or whatever you want. 

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:10.936
 The resulting effect is quite uninteresting. There's not too much glitter 

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:16.241
 So keep in mind. Yeah, so as you can see, there is no spark or glitter anywhere 

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.425
 which is a little embarrassing. this mixture cools very quickly, so I had to put it back in the oven 

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.869
 Another few minutes until it was syrupy again. Then I took my apple, 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.255
 I carefully dipped it and spun it around until I got a nice layer. But beware, this is super hot, 

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:34.010
 so don't burn like an idiot. It's definitely a mess 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.691
 but I was still spinning around until it cooled and hardened. 

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:44.773
 And that's what came out of it. Well, I have to admit that my technique isn't the best. 

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:49.069
 This is the first time I've '' dressed '' apple, so I did everything right. 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.701
 But I certainly didn't get the glittering effect I really wanted. So I wanted to try one more apple. 

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:59.796
 This time I thought all glitters are pretty edible not? It's just whether you decide 

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:04.801
 if you want to eat it. And if you want to glitter for one week. 

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:09.363
 With this persistent thought in my head, I melted another batch of Jolly Ranchers, 

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:15.273
 added some classic glitter, mixed it and mm-hm, here it is. 

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:21.273
 There's the glitter I've been looking for. Mm wt. I thought so. 

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:25.186
 I took another apple and carefully dipped it into a new mixture. 

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:30.039
 So I turned the soaked apple, and now that's what I'm talking about. Huh? 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:36.458
 Look at that. I'm definitely very excited to eat this. It's a bit, a little hard 

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:40.480
 You know, but I drank milk. I have strong bones and teeth. I 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.578
 I think I can handle it. Good. It won't work here. 

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:48.826
 I have to find a good place here. 

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.296
 Huh. 

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:09.273
 [coughing] 

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:16.983
 [screaming]
