00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.199
 pikes here so I'm going to start 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.310
 by lures that are the best 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 for me soft lures of sierentz 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 flexible killers we add a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.039
 leaded heads of 7 grams of which I am going 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 make you see then like that that is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 mounted is their tape very well I 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.440
 like that and then we have them 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.270
 what was this custom wars but when they 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.090
 are blue and white with a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.570
 leaded heads of this serious so here 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.149
 making me schering lure 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 white color with glitter 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 So here is a killer who walks 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 very well there will be added a head 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 leaded 7 g 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.609
 so here I hope I'm going to type 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 the pole with them tomorrow that's next 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.149
 So here is a leaded lead of 7 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.450
 grams a basic leaded head 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.390
 here after that I'll introduce you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.820
 two hours from zac so a lure 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 flexible like this here it was a very 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.259
 good their hymn h not but he has you well 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.020
 is not a lure that works very well 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.189
 very well but it's a lure that makes 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 that they imitate a fish in the water 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.930
 but it works well and lasts with 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.829
 a little bib 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.009
 that's what kills me a trout we do not 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.110
 can impute a small fish that the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.079
 poles he loves defending I'm doing 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.259
 that end that I do not like too much does this 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 their ceo throwing times and two triples 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.370
 clings like everything like those 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.920
 it clings and the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.320
 time can not fish properly 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.430
 this is just the default that I 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.380
 found on this lure but otherwise he 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.030
 works very well 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.930
 here is now I'll have you spent 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.870
 to prayers so I have three spoons 4 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.910
 even spoons that they are very very 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.160
 well for the boom these are the 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.700
 spoons net of spoons walking 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.400
 very very good 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.840
 so here we have a fluorescent meps spoon 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.270
 blue eps then I still have 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.300
 spoons and this one it's not a 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.930
 normal spoon is a spoon with 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.490
 a little behind them who imitates 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 white in the lead is a small limit 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.940
 white and the poles are crazy 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
