will see you at the first hatch test

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.940 
will see you at the first hatch test
which<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.610> speed<00:03:00.940> test<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.840> yeah<00:03:02.410> I'll<00:03:02.710> go

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
which was a speed test and yeah I'll go

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.540 
which was a speed test and yeah I'll go
and<00:03:03.130> go<00:03:03.400> transition<00:03:04.000> over<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.300> that<00:03:04.570> now<00:03:05.550> okay

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
and go transition over to that now okay

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.730 
and go transition over to that now okay
so<00:03:06.610> here<00:03:07.030> we're<00:03:07.180> going<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.600> what<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> top

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
so here we're going to see what the top

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.990 
so here we're going to see what the top
speed<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.910> car<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:11.520> obviously<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.730> an<00:03:12.790> S

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
speed of this car is obviously it's an S

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.910 
speed of this car is obviously it's an S
Class<00:03:13.240> car<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.960> would<00:03:14.320> expect<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.800> go

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
Class car so you would expect it to go

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.120 
Class car so you would expect it to go
about<00:03:15.160> 175<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:16.990> tuned<00:03:17.530> on<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.010> it's

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
about 175 but it is a tuned on so it's

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.340 
about 175 but it is a tuned on so it's
obviously<00:03:18.370> gonna<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.820> lot<00:03:19.270> harder<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:20.170> get

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
obviously gonna be a lot harder to get

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.680 
obviously gonna be a lot harder to get
that<00:03:20.500> top<00:03:20.680> speed<00:03:20.860> here<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.160> go<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.510> naught

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
that top speed here we go so the naught

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.180 
that top speed here we go so the naught
sticky<00:03:23.020> time<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.470> probably<00:03:23.739> somewhere<00:03:24.130> in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
sticky time was probably somewhere in

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.010 
sticky time was probably somewhere in
the<00:03:24.250> region<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.610> about<00:03:25.060> three<00:03:25.390> seconds<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.930> was

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
the region of about three seconds it was

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.280 
the region of about three seconds it was
not<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.620> long<00:03:26.680> at<00:03:27.280> all<00:03:27.640> I'll<00:03:28.510> see<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.780> gonna

see some in a minute my difficulties I

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.520 
see some in a minute my difficulties I
believe<00:03:36.940> oh<00:03:37.330> they<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.110> got<00:03:38.260> traction

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
believe oh they have got traction

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.620 
believe oh they have got traction
control<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.640> maybe<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:39.940> don't<00:03:40.060> know<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.420> if

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
control on so maybe I don't know that if

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.270 
control on so maybe I don't know that if
that<00:03:40.750> has<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.140> do<00:03:41.290> with<00:03:41.320> something<00:03:41.620> here

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
that has to do with something here

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.880 
that has to do with something here
obviously<00:03:42.550> reaching<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.720> max<00:03:44.019> speed<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
obviously reaching it's a max speed of

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.550 
obviously reaching it's a max speed of
about<00:03:47.010> 182<00:03:48.300> very<00:03:49.300> very<00:03:49.750> good<00:03:49.930> indeed<00:03:50.200> there

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
about 182 very very good indeed there

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.650 
about 182 very very good indeed there
you<00:03:50.620> go<00:03:50.680> about<00:03:50.830> 183<00:03:51.250> 182<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.150> didn't<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.510> don't

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
you go about 183 182 I didn't I don't

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.720 
you go about 183 182 I didn't I don't
think<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:52.900> saw<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.260> go<00:03:53.410> past<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:53.860> at<00:03:53.980> 83

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
think I saw it go past one at 83

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.240 
think I saw it go past one at 83
so<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.239> max<00:03:55.480> speed<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.720> obviously<00:03:56.140> one<00:03:56.650> eight

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so it's max speed is obviously one eight

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.420 
so it's max speed is obviously one eight
three<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:58.590> take<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.739> as<00:03:59.800> you<00:03:59.980> will<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.220> think

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
three so take it as you will I think

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.009 
three so take it as you will I think
that's<00:04:00.790> pretty<00:04:00.970> fast<00:04:01.239> for<00:04:01.390> an<00:04:01.450> s-class<00:04:01.690> car

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
that's pretty fast for an s-class car

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.530 
that's pretty fast for an s-class car
and<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.769> will<00:04:02.980> give<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.370> its<00:04:03.550> thumbs<00:04:03.940> up<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.420> is

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and I will give it its thumbs up that is

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.610 
and I will give it its thumbs up that is
definitely<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.260> good<00:04:05.769> sign

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
definitely a good sign

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.140 
definitely a good sign
okay<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.950> next<00:04:09.100> test<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.610> gonna<00:04:09.730> be<00:04:09.970> a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
okay so the next test it's gonna be a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.259 
okay so the next test it's gonna be a
drift<00:04:10.750> test<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:12.100> like<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.820> think<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.060> myself

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
drift test now I like to think of myself

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.170 
drift test now I like to think of myself
a<00:04:13.660> pretty<00:04:14.110> good<00:04:14.260> drifter<00:04:14.920> I'm<00:04:15.040> not<00:04:15.220> bad<00:04:15.489> you

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
a pretty good drifter I'm not bad you

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390 
a pretty good drifter I'm not bad you
know<00:04:16.330> but<00:04:16.540> this<00:04:16.630> car<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.290> was<00:04:17.440> hard<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:18.130> would

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
know but this car it was hard it would

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.280 
know but this car it was hard it would
to<00:04:18.850> drift<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.330> this<00:04:19.450> car<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.930> must<00:04:20.080> be<00:04:20.200> an

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
to drift it in this car you must be an

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.029 
to drift it in this car you must be an
MLG<00:04:20.709> pro<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.430> was<00:04:22.020> planted<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.500> know<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.890> was

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
MLG pro it was planted you know it was

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.560 
MLG pro it was planted you know it was
just<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.460> wouldn't<00:04:24.729> leave<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.090> ground<00:04:25.330> it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
just it wouldn't leave the ground it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.910 
just it wouldn't leave the ground it
wouldn't<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:25.930> us<00:04:26.020> back<00:04:26.200> end<00:04:26.470> out

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
wouldn't get us back end out

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.220 
wouldn't get us back end out
it<00:04:27.250> was<00:04:27.460> just<00:04:27.610> there<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.150> was<00:04:28.360> safe<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.930> floor

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
it was just there it was safe the floor

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.250 
it was just there it was safe the floor
no<00:04:29.440> matter<00:04:29.740> what<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:31.480> could<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:31.810> cannot<00:04:32.050> rip

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
no matter what you could you cannot rip

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.140 
no matter what you could you cannot rip
this<00:04:32.350> car<00:04:32.620> I'm<00:04:33.250> determined

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
this car I'm determined

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.720 
this car I'm determined
you<00:04:34.540> cannot<00:04:35.020> drift<00:04:35.800> this<00:04:36.010> car<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.460> want<00:04:36.640> to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
you cannot drift this car if you want to

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.130 
you cannot drift this car if you want to
give<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:37.030> give<00:04:37.480> it<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.630> go

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
give this give it a go

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.070 
give this give it a go
be<00:04:38.410> my<00:04:38.680> guest<00:04:39.310> but<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.790> car<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.240> impossible

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
be my guest but this car is impossible

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.260 
be my guest but this car is impossible
to<00:04:41.200> drift<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.310> wouldn't<00:04:42.610> move<00:04:42.730> like<00:04:43.060> here

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
to drift it just wouldn't move like here

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.690 
to drift it just wouldn't move like here
you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.510> see<00:04:43.720> me<00:04:43.900> trying<00:04:44.170> to<00:04:44.260> get<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.400> move<00:04:45.550> it

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
you can see me trying to get to move it

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.910 
you can see me trying to get to move it
it<00:04:45.820> would<00:04:46.120> not<00:04:46.690> move<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:47.050> absolutely<00:04:47.530> planted

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
it would not move is absolutely planted

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.650 
it would not move is absolutely planted
to<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.100> ground<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.390> know<00:04:49.480> it's

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
to the ground and this you know it's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.050 
to the ground and this you know it's
probably<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.020> sign<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.980> see<00:04:51.220> how<00:04:51.460> good<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:51.850> car

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
probably a sign to see how good this car

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.570 
probably a sign to see how good this car
is<00:04:52.270> on<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.420> sir<00:04:52.750> cage<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.590> wouldn't<00:04:54.190> drink<00:04:54.400> it

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
is on a sir cage it wouldn't drink it

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.360 
is on a sir cage it wouldn't drink it
would<00:04:54.970> not<00:04:55.510> drift<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:56.200> here<00:04:56.440> I'm<00:04:57.010> gonna<00:04:57.190> go

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
would not drift so here I'm gonna go

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.910 
would not drift so here I'm gonna go
move<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.150> race<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:59.140> I<00:04:59.200> you<00:04:59.320> did<00:04:59.620> which<00:04:59.890> is

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
move to the race that I you did which is

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.220 
move to the race that I you did which is
obviously<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.340> third<00:05:00.460> test<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.000> yeah<00:05:01.990> I'll

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
obviously the third test and yeah I'll

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.010 
obviously the third test and yeah I'll
see<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.590> there

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
see you there

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.930 
see you there
okay<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.260> did<00:05:05.440> skip<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.950> 60%<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.640> races

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
okay so I did skip to 60% of the races

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.520 
okay so I did skip to 60% of the races
to<00:05:07.120> get<00:05:07.570> all<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.780> boring<00:05:08.020> stuff<00:05:08.110> out<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.440> way

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
to get all the boring stuff out the way

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.980 
to get all the boring stuff out the way
with<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.760> was<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.060> reason<00:05:10.360> why<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.480> lost

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
with and this was the reason why I lost

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.720 
with and this was the reason why I lost
I<00:05:11.020> actually<00:05:11.200> crashed<00:05:11.620> into<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.890> car<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:12.670> can

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
I actually crashed into a car but I can

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.100 
I actually crashed into a car but I can
tell<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.240> from<00:05:13.390> what<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.570> played<00:05:13.870> with<00:05:14.020> the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
tell you from what I played with the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.310 
tell you from what I played with the
kindest<00:05:14.590> but<00:05:14.890> I<00:05:15.070> think<00:05:15.280> of<00:05:15.370> these<00:05:15.460> three<00:05:15.640> races

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
kindest but I think of these three races

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.870 
kindest but I think of these three races
the<00:05:17.320> cars<00:05:17.560> very<00:05:17.620> planted<00:05:18.130> obviously<00:05:18.520> the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the cars very planted obviously the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.610 
the cars very planted obviously the
turning<00:05:19.360> circle<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:19.900> very<00:05:20.080> limited<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.590> will

turning circle it's very limited I will

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.950 
turning circle it's very limited I will
say<00:05:20.920> that<00:05:21.160> but<00:05:21.700> it's<00:05:22.240> very<00:05:22.300> planted<00:05:22.810> it's<00:05:22.930> a

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
say that but it's very planted it's a

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.600 
say that but it's very planted it's a
very<00:05:23.140> good<00:05:23.290> car<00:05:23.530> for<00:05:24.070> those<00:05:24.220> type<00:05:24.460> of

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
very good car for those type of

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.640 
very good car for those type of
competitive<00:05:25.060> races<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:26.200> I've<00:05:26.410> definitely

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
competitive races and I've definitely

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.440 
competitive races and I've definitely
recommend<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:27.430> considering<00:05:27.970> it's<00:05:28.090> got<00:05:28.240> such<00:05:28.420> a

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
recommend it considering it's got such a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.260 
recommend it considering it's got such a
broad<00:05:28.750> range<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:30.280> know<00:05:30.430> classes<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.120> can

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
broad range of you know classes you can

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.700 
broad range of you know classes you can
use<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.110> it's<00:05:32.200> always<00:05:32.320> all<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
use it in it I think it's always all the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.010 
use it in it I think it's always all the
way<00:05:32.800> from<00:05:32.980> D<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.400> X<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:34.480> know<00:05:34.630> for<00:05:34.960> those

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
way from D to X you know for those

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.930 
way from D to X you know for those
hatchback<00:05:35.530> races<00:05:35.890> it's<00:05:36.370> a<00:05:36.460> very<00:05:36.670> viable

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
hatchback races it's a very viable

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.360 
hatchback races it's a very viable
option<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.600> definitely<00:05:38.110> recommend<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.160> for

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
option and I definitely recommend it for

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.760 
option and I definitely recommend it for
you<00:05:39.970> know<00:05:40.090> just<00:05:40.420> general<00:05:40.750> racing<00:05:41.110> 3<00:05:41.350> Rika<00:05:41.740> and

obviously can see me making a lot of

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.060 
obviously can see me making a lot of
mistakes<00:05:45.460> here<00:05:45.850> that's<00:05:46.150> just<00:05:46.360> user<00:05:47.070> error

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070

mistakes here that's just user error
mistakes<00:05:48.640> the<00:05:48.910> car<00:05:49.120> is<00:05:49.300> fun<00:05:49.660> phenomenal<00:05:50.430> the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
mistakes the car is fun phenomenal the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.920 
mistakes the car is fun phenomenal the
fact<00:05:51.670> it<00:05:51.790> doesn't<00:05:51.820> drift<00:05:52.270> makes<00:05:52.540> it<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.780> more

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
fact it doesn't drift makes it a more

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.430 
fact it doesn't drift makes it a more
viable<00:05:53.230> option<00:05:53.440> I<00:05:53.680> think<00:05:53.980> for<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.260> circuit<00:05:56.260> car

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
viable option I think for a circuit car

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.490 
viable option I think for a circuit car
now<00:05:56.740> I'm<00:05:57.550> gonna<00:05:57.760> go<00:05:57.970> over<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:59.320> know<00:05:59.440> to

opinions on this mark to golf then I'm

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.480 
opinions on this mark to golf then I'm
one<00:06:16.870> suggested<00:06:17.290> for<00:06:17.410> drifting<00:06:17.710> it's<00:06:18.160> for

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
one suggested for drifting it's for

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.910 
one suggested for drifting it's for
drifting<00:06:18.790> it's<00:06:18.940> a<00:06:19.030> no-no<00:06:19.390> I<00:06:19.630> could<00:06:20.620> say<00:06:20.740> that

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
drifting it's a no-no I could say that

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.740 
drifting it's a no-no I could say that
without<00:06:21.310> without<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.820> shadow<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.180> a<00:06:22.330> doubt<00:06:22.360> you

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
without without a shadow of a doubt you

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.570 
without without a shadow of a doubt you
know<00:06:22.900> customisation<00:06:23.740> is<00:06:23.770> also<00:06:24.070> grow<00:06:24.280> option

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
know customisation is also grow option

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.190 
know customisation is also grow option
obviously<00:06:24.940> got<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.330> lot<00:06:25.480> of<00:06:25.510> lot<00:06:25.780> of<00:06:25.810> option<00:06:26.080> for

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
obviously got a lot of lot of option for

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.560 
obviously got a lot of lot of option for
the<00:06:26.260> front<00:06:26.500> bumpers<00:06:26.860> and<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.670> got<00:06:27.850> some<00:06:28.120> some

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
the front bumpers and you got some some

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.930 
the front bumpers and you got some some
options<00:06:28.840> for<00:06:28.900> this<00:06:29.140> side<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.560> back<00:06:29.910> but<00:06:30.910> I

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
options for this side and back but I

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.340 
options for this side and back but I
wouldn't<00:06:31.270> obviously<00:06:31.480> make<00:06:31.810> it<00:06:31.930> in<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.080> one

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
wouldn't obviously make it in a one

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.560 
wouldn't obviously make it in a one
suggestion<00:06:33.190> for<00:06:33.490> customisation<00:06:34.330> you've<00:06:34.480> got

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
suggestion for customisation you've got

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.240 
suggestion for customisation you've got
a<00:06:34.600> lot<00:06:34.840> of<00:06:34.930> Japanese<00:06:35.350> cars<00:06:35.560> which<00:06:35.950> are<00:06:36.100> better

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
a lot of Japanese cars which are better

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.480 
a lot of Japanese cars which are better
feel<00:06:36.490> for<00:06:36.670> that<00:06:37.470> for<00:06:38.470> a<00:06:38.500> circuit<00:06:38.920> car<00:06:39.130> I

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
feel for that for a circuit car I

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
feel for that for a circuit car I
definitely<00:06:39.970> recommend<00:06:40.240> it

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
definitely recommend it

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.420 
definitely recommend it
for<00:06:40.630> a<00:06:40.660> hatchback<00:06:40.870> circuit<00:06:41.590> car<00:06:41.800> it's

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
for a hatchback circuit car it's

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.460 
for a hatchback circuit car it's
possibly<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:42.970> best<00:06:43.060> on<00:06:43.300> the<00:06:43.540> game<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:44.320> know

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
possibly the best on the game you know

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.990 
possibly the best on the game you know
it's<00:06:44.650> very<00:06:44.680> planted<00:06:45.220> to<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:45.340> ground<00:06:45.640> and

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
it's very planted to the ground and

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.550 
it's very planted to the ground and
you're<00:06:46.480> not<00:06:46.630> gonna<00:06:46.780> get<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.080> to<00:06:47.140> drift<00:06:47.320> unless

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
you're not gonna get it to drift unless

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.950 
you're not gonna get it to drift unless
you<00:06:47.740> tap<00:06:48.220> that<00:06:48.340> ebrake<00:06:48.730> or<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:49.570> if<00:06:49.720> someone

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
you tap that ebrake or you if someone

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.720 
you tap that ebrake or you if someone
knocks<00:06:50.260> you<00:06:50.440> off<00:06:50.470> track<00:06:50.710> it's<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.100> very<00:06:51.550> good

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
knocks you off track it's a very good

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.670 
knocks you off track it's a very good
car<00:06:52.000> before<00:06:52.450> that<00:06:52.810> obviously<00:06:53.230> looks<00:06:53.440> wise

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
car before that obviously looks wise

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.920 
car before that obviously looks wise
it's<00:06:53.950> got<00:06:54.070> a<00:06:54.100> lot<00:06:54.340> of<00:06:54.460> design<00:06:54.820> options<00:06:55.630> in<00:06:55.810> the

it's got a lot of design options in the
storefront<00:06:56.260> and<00:06:56.800> I<00:06:57.130> definitely<00:06:57.640> recommend<00:06:57.970> it
