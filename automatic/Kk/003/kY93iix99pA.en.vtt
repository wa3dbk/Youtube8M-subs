00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.310 

the<00:00:08.849> TriCaster<00:00:09.480> allows<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.929> bring<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.170> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the TriCaster allows you to bring in a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.740 
the TriCaster allows you to bring in a
variety<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.769> audio<00:00:11.250> inputs<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.330> has<00:00:12.509> its

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
variety of audio inputs and it has its

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.959 
variety of audio inputs and it has its
own<00:00:12.960> internal<00:00:13.349> devices<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.549> can<00:00:14.730> create

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
own internal devices that can create

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
own internal devices that can create
audio<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.990> need<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> way<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> mix<00:00:16.710> all<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
audio so you need a way to mix all that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
audio so you need a way to mix all that
audio<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.270> out

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
audio on the way out

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.470 
audio on the way out
well<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.619> TriCaster<00:00:20.310> comes<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:21.000> an<00:00:21.180> audio

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260 
/ video coming into the system now
you'll<00:00:49.500> notice<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> switcher<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.910> we

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you'll notice on the switcher that we

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
you'll notice on the switcher that we
have<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.750> follow<00:00:52.110> control<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.280> for

have a follow control and this is for

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
have a follow control and this is for
audio<00:00:53.969> follow<00:00:54.449> video<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.890> means

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
audio follow video and that means

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.869 
audio follow video and that means
whenever<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.469> live<00:00:58.800> input<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
whenever that is the live input on the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
whenever that is the live input on the
switcher<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.300> audio<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.079> live<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.859> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
switcher that audio will be live but if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
switcher that audio will be live but if
you<00:01:02.039> switch<00:01:02.340> away<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.239> input<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you switch away from that input that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
you switch away from that input that
audio<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.500> fade<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> audio<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
audio will fade down and the audio for

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
audio will fade down and the audio for
