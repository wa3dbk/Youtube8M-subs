00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the azuqueca basket has started from very 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 different way last season in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.770
 a party very worked for the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.690
 premises before a polytechnic university 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.240
 of valència that went from azuqueca without 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.070
 understand much the result the first 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 fourth was very even the two teams 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.880
 They failed and were equally and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.350
 both were launched to the attack and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.330
 although the university picked up from the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.680
 start a small advantage the equality 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.810
 remained in these first ten 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.670
 minutes and finished the first quarter with 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.470
 tie at 21 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.540
 the second room was more of the same 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 although the azuqueca basket took the lead 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.980
 on the scoreboard he did not go beyond the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 Three points Jorge Bar was the paladin 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 of the team and he only got more than 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 50% of your team's points 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.989
 college pivots 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 they scored with ease and some failures 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.300
 in defense they got that the azuqueca not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 went out on the score at rest 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.379
 40-37 the third quarter followed with a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.000
 tremendous equality but the university 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.890
 he started playing with advantage in the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 scoreboard thanks to the clamorous failures 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.839
 in defense of the premises neither the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 tickets to basket worked and so the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.280
 valencia went up to five points 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 up an incredible triple of reds in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 the last second left the marker in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.549
 56 55 and everything to decide for the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.549
 next room 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.619
 the last quarter did not start anything right 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.270
 for the locals that they saw as those of 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.670
 valencia they went with the score thanks 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 to his might in the inner game with a 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.080
 gustavo tour as principal executor 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.700
 local people did not see any of the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.159
 ways if they were going with a disadvantage of 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 9 points on the score in the absence of 5 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.530
 minutes to the end 60 69 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.420
 the tiredness accumulated in the visitors 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.730
 and personal faults began to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.230
 take their toll and the premises started to 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.870
 see aaron the figure of sergio fernández 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.670
 ibarra that brought the marker up 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.520
 equal it with two free throws of this 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.520
 last 74 74 and to the extension 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.640
 in the extension the little bench of the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.009
 visitors began to take their bill and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.960
 each time it was harder for them to write down the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.580
 local failed again and again baskets 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.620
 under the hoop alone but the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.050
 opponent's counterattacks either does not curdle 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.060
 they go to 20 seconds molina put them 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 ahead 81 82 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.810
 lack of staff of the visiting team and 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.480
 Carlos García took responsibility 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 and took the two free throws the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.650
 only ones that he had thrown in all the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.920
 match giving the lead to the basket 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.920
 azuqueca 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.450
 the last shot of life did not enter and gave the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.150
 victory to the home team in a match 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.400
 where anyone could win a match 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.120
 of those who creates interesting hobby and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.120
 motivator 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.519
 match 83 82 wins 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.330
 the hike azuqueca pp the first match and 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.920
 already suffering is not a normal thing 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 here in azuqueca and in the league eba 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.370
 I always say that anyone can 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.050
 win and anyone can win then 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.790
 good and we have suffered a lot although a 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.530
 good team very veteran that we have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.150
 put things very difficult with 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.519
 experience in league eba and always the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.989
 first matches are difficult to 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.910
 value because we have played 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.200
 we only have a month of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.849
 training and good what is important is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.950
 that has stayed at home and we will add 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.660
 the first victory whatever it is to win is 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.060
 good for us 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.170
 remember that we made a good match 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.690
 we went ahead and we lost the first 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.579
 unfairly and good, I think that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.319
 it's a match that has been good for us 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.120
 gives confidence and now we go to gandhi to 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.680
 see what if the plan we have a 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.410
 signed player that is a great 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 player like manuel redero de la moza 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.270
 we are waiting for you for the topics 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.400
 of 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.990
 that he has work and he has difficulty coming 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.160
 schedule and such let's make an effort 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.570
 in waiting for you 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.830
 we do not want to sign unless you tell us 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.780
 that can not already definitely 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.430
 we would look for another player but neither 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.200
 that we have to go crazy, I think 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.580
 that with the equipment that we have this is 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.520
 same the team in the past removing 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.710
 esteban and removing tomás and adrián that 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.090
 we are able to save category and I 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.820
 I think that Carlos García Galán is going to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.920
 give many games if it's mine the truth is 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.840
 it gives me great but overall 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.510
 the whole team with an incredible effort 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.430
 of everyone even in the extension and good 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.770
 there we have the prize the finalist of the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.480
 and see if we can continue with 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.330
 this good streak happens the truth that we 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.060
 it cost a lot, we were seven parties 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.590
 followed without winning and is very important 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.710
 start winning for the confidence of the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.850
 team and everything and good with this victory 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.520
 next week in gandia if 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.730
 we get another one and if we go through the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.730
 good way
