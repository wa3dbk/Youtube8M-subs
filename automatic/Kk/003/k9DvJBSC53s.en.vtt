00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.140
 great or that sounded in Munich 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.179
 philharmonic 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.260
 here they are otherwise always at home the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.509
 Munich Philharmonic 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.340
 Today they are all free except one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 I can ask the chief conductor 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.930
 majestro lorin maazel why chase us 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.930
 drums actually scared one 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.079
 why can the drums scare you ? 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.770
 in the rhythm which is constant 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:42.920
 and that grows very slowly brings one 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:50.260
 fantastic restlessness and fear as a pro 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.260
 you do not try to lead 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.860
 but there are certainly also drummers 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.100
 they are really wrong 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 have carved to the wrong of his the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.649
 Final professionals and they are done 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.070
 fanatical lover of the tradition 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.270
 drums students who are considered 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.480
 seven hours were yours with buses like that 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.510
 They love that that's it for them 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.610
 almost a drug you practice there dam dam 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.350
 for hours and enthusiastically right 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.690
 that is life for them and it can be 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.350
 I can absolutely excl 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.350
 not there
