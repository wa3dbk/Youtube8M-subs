how's<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.850> feel<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.180> think<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.420> could<00:00:06.600> you

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
how's it feel you think you could you

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.089 
how's it feel you think you could you
could<00:00:06.930> use<00:00:07.109> something<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.589> yeah<00:00:08.069> I

could use something like that yeah I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.570

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
think so the nerf arrows probably need

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.980 
think so the nerf arrows probably need
to<00:00:11.700> be<00:00:11.730> replaced<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.360> something<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.750> little

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to be replaced with something a little

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.470 
to be replaced with something a little
bit<00:00:13.110> better<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.639> yeah<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.210> would<00:00:15.389> be

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
