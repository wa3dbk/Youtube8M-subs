00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
this is fat bee man and wintertime and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.410 
this is fat bee man and wintertime and
we're<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> start<00:00:09.960> thinking<00:00:10.469> about

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
we're going to start thinking about

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.289 
we're going to start thinking about
raising<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.599> queens<00:00:12.900> spring<00:00:13.620> time<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.700> this

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
raising some queens spring time now this

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.570 
raising some queens spring time now this
is<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:16.070> baby<00:00:17.070> nuke<00:00:17.550> which<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.710> half<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.010> size<00:00:20.279> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
is a baby nuke which is half the size of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
is a baby nuke which is half the size of
a<00:00:20.730> standard<00:00:20.970> frame<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.769> I'll<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.279> go

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a standard frame and what I'll do is go

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.500 
a standard frame and what I'll do is go
through<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.850> step<00:00:24.210> by<00:00:24.240> step<00:00:25.099> the<00:00:26.210> whole<00:00:27.210> thing

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
through it step by step the whole thing

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
through it step by step the whole thing
of<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.460> basically<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.789> one

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
of this here is basically this is one

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.430 
of this here is basically this is one
whole<00:00:30.750> frame<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> one

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
whole frame and see this here is one

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.580 
whole frame and see this here is one
frame<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> basically<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.910> we've<00:00:36.059> done<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
frame and basically what we've done is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
frame and basically what we've done is
we<00:00:37.590> cut<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> half<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> took<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> standard

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
we cut it in half if you took a standard

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
we cut it in half if you took a standard
frame<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.829> would<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.579> end<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
frame which would be one end to the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
frame which would be one end to the
other<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:43.020> 19<00:00:43.500> inches<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.340> we're<00:00:44.489> going

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
other be 19 inches so what we're going

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209 
other be 19 inches so what we're going
to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> split<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to do is we're going to split all this

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.389 
to do is we're going to split all this
wood<00:00:47.670> every<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.170> made<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
wood every bit of this is made out of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.650 
wood every bit of this is made out of
scrap<00:00:51.469> now<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.059> step<00:00:54.449> by<00:00:54.480> step

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
scrap now I'm going to go step by step

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.490 
scrap now I'm going to go step by step
here

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
here
