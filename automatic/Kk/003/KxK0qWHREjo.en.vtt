 x 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.530
 at different times 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.279
 turnovers 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.509
 the main problem is important 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.409
 I intend to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.090
 never work like that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 in a car accident 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 jccf 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
 but 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 I created a project 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 square 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.050
 2 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.410
 according to data from December 5 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 why 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 Rosstat 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 found a typo 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 square 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.119
 Polanski 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.439
 according to suffered about 20 thousand 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 in this region 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:54.459
 Oscar 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.459
 previous time 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.719
 so 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.859
 simply put 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.859
 in this situation when using frequencies 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 cause 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.429
 t 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.149
 if share 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.109
 in the end it will remain 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:04.859
 cause of death 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.859
 someone will believe 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.969
 chl 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.169
 if a 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.169
 writes the author of the article 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.620
 x 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.620
