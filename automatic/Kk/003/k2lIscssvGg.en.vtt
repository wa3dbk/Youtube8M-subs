00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.610
 hello guys today we will show one 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.230
 very interesting and spectacular and generally 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.410
 cool fact but again it is a bit 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.539
 useless as you see we are now on 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.440
 moment we are in some abyss i am not 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.220
 I know what it's like to call it somehow 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.040
 really under the map and how are you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.379
 see we play for spirits a and what 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.660
 spiritualists they have one thing in common they 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.300
 he doesn't have skins that 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.859
 allow them to pass through the cards on 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.480
 in fact, a lot of heroes possess 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.469
 like ability but few to 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.629
 thought of it 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.629
 a full list of heroes who can 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.600
 pass through the map I throw off 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.519
 description well and let's teach you how it all 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 do it the same way it is a ball 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:08.460
 flies here and let's not skate 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.040
 for some reason you can not rolls 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 links to sample first of all 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.329
 everyone was parted hooray so so for 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.530
 beginning we have to go the most 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:27.399
 upper left corner more precisely the leftmost 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.680
 map angle and territory calculation 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.380
 certainly not necessary but desirable 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.079
 because it is enough to improve vision 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.520
 so everything drains touch me now I 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.140
 you need to go to the base for 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.509
 wards so that you visually easier 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.649
 show this whole thing so everything is fine 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:49.659
 now i will return there water here all 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:52.700
 okay go back so to speak from the rules 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.270
 son yes good site 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.909
 so all i'm there come on myself i'm so all that we 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 cleared the area we have 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.600
 for example a storm or some memory 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.399
 another hero that we will have in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.240
 describing the whole list we will come description 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.759
 in general or 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.530
 he will use storms or wort 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.569
 spirit that they are less 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.239
 just making it simple i think i 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.180
 this is the storm that he has for it all 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.150
 necessity so all don't touch me so 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.180
 first we have to do something to press 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 on the ultu take 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.200
 screen the topmost left of your 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.739
 camera go there your screen camera and from there 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.349
 here you press the letters r as you can see there 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.819
 I turn on 3d models slightly sewed on 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.480
 click on my horse on the idea should 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.329
 rise this camera 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.849
 from the side, yes, as you can see here 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.890
 stay topaz but unfortunately walk 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.239
 we can't walk at all 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.980
 you can only move 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.590
 here here also we can now 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.670
 sneak off the map what get under 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.209
 cards need to push 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.980
 p and even higher choose the point of displacement with 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.280
 using ulta and we generally find yourself 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.639
 under the cards for small you nobody there 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.930
 will get no way at all it's just 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.880
 unreal in general you yourself hope 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.000
 understand what you are under cards 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.959
 in general already outside the mechanics and the world of dota and in 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.060
 common matrix 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.730
 so well let's try to cut it and 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.970
 so well, I rubbed and as taught let's try 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.239
 Now and we will attach to vich we substitute 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.239
 put 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.730
 as you take off there and so now i 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.920
 practice for you to listen inside and even 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.650
 I do not see and by the way, have a long chip 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.819
 look through 3d mod 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.290
 bottom left here 's this river 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.239
 start 10 away 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.959
 all of us are now in order for your cards 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.540
 pitches come jump on this place 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.180
 as you see now we have this one 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.370
 background on yellow and daughter and by the way he 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.290
 blue it is fun it is size with from 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.599
 day and night 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.109
 Sydney if people are yellow this is 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.349
 understandable in general, such is the tank itself 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.560
 in fact if professionally forgets 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.959
 then you play on the helm cheek hero 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.299
 call me a person have not tried this 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.759
 A bug for example, sitting in you, flies huskar and 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.650
 you somehow you manage 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.479
 fly right over there he stay here 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.300
 forever you can calmly still 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.880
 through teleport still bark 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.520
 detox ordinary proven even in general 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:40.229
 very interesting as some have thought 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:44.009
 up so find fly so interesting 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.229
 will it fly or not is important chicken 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.389
 but I'm kinda like the analogue flies through 20 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.580
 stones, but under the map I do not know will fly 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:58.710
 she or not look see it 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:02.960
 generally an hour flies to only included 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:09.270
 interesting and it is not even Versus forever us 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.759
 flew ahrenet okay always planted 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:18.060
 I would save the rice but you can beat the chicken 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:21.980
 And in general, in any case, it will plunge 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.840
 in shock your opponent more precisely khuskara 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.700
 in general, I thought he would be shakira 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.070
 ohrenet what a cool thing 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.570
 showed me and one guy for that to him 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.820
 thank you very much here by the way 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.490
 can be considered modelki Tomsk you 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.490
 or something like that with a 3d mod here just 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.580
 fine work three more yes here 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.820
 just awesome, well, in general, that's all 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.860
 the fate of the mountain here you understand you need to go 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.840
 here in this corner of the map and from there you i 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.190
 I think you can do everything yourself but if 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.100
 you can not write a comment 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.530
 tried as someone a butcher but lighter 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.570
 all houses in vain do this storms due 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.190
 You can be lazy in general very much 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.410
 heroes can crank it 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.070
 I will write in the description you are already there 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.480
 guess how to do it I just 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.940
 threw off a description of the heroes who can do it 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:14.180
 do so oh well guys on and only 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.430
 that I can rely on you played 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.770
 would be the background and the hell the blue background is cool 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.430
 Yes, really beautiful as a jerk 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.030
 bear yourself then this is all thanks for 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.770
 viewing 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.990
 it was certainly a useless tank but 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.140
 cool enough spectacular and in general 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.670
 by itself is famously worthless and everything 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.620

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.660
