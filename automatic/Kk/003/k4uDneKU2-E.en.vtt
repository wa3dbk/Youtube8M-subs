00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
the goal of any kind of base layer is to

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.640 
the goal of any kind of base layer is to
keep<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.850> acclimatized<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.750> regulated<00:00:46.350> so

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
keep you acclimatized and regulated so

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
better more proficient and safer rider

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.130 
better more proficient and safer rider
so<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.790> we<00:00:50.910> look<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.810> know<00:00:51.930> think

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so if we look at this you know think

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
so if we look at this you know think
about<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.410> under<00:00:52.980> armour<00:00:53.160> started<00:00:53.580> this<00:00:53.640> craze

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
about it under armour started this craze

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.390 
about it under armour started this craze
probably<00:00:54.390> 15<00:00:54.870> years<00:00:54.900> ago<00:00:55.290> every<00:00:56.160> major

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
probably 15 years ago every major

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.150 
probably 15 years ago every major
mountaineering<00:00:57.140> manufacturer<00:00:58.140> has<00:00:58.530> taken

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
mountaineering manufacturer has taken

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.620 
mountaineering manufacturer has taken
their<00:00:59.310> crack<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.730> compression<00:01:00.270> suits<00:01:00.420> from

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
their crack at compression suits from

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.390 
their crack at compression suits from
the<00:01:00.780> big<00:01:00.960> guys<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> small<00:01:01.680> size<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
the big guys to the small size the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.890 
the big guys to the small size the
difference<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.240> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> motorcycle

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
difference here is this is motorcycle

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.960 
difference here is this is motorcycle
specific<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.220> does<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.339> mean<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.759> I<00:01:05.850> was

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
specific so what does that mean if I was

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
specific so what does that mean if I was
wearing<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> ski<00:01:06.630> jacket<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.619> like

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
wearing just a ski jacket would be like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.170 
wearing just a ski jacket would be like
okay<00:01:07.979> I'd<00:01:08.159> wear<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.610> compression<00:01:08.939> suit

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
okay I'd wear my compression suit

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340 
okay I'd wear my compression suit
underneath<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.659> could<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.170> even

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
underneath it could be a more even

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.660 
underneath it could be a more even
material<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.490> laid<00:01:11.640> out

around<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.060> construction<00:01:27.690> what<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.050> do<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
around it construction what I do is I

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.899 
around it construction what I do is I
create<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> slight<00:01:29.100> air<00:01:29.340> gap<00:01:29.550> it's<00:01:29.760> going<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
create a slight air gap it's going to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.130 
create a slight air gap it's going to
allow<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.479> breathe<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.990> bit

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
allow this to breathe a little bit

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
allow this to breathe a little bit
better<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.010> more<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.460> wicking

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
better so it's more it's wicking

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.610 
better so it's more it's wicking

sweat for the wintertime this is keeping

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.360 
sweat for the wintertime this is keeping
you<00:01:36.600> cool<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.380> warm<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.040> started<00:01:38.280> keeping

you<00:01:38.549> dry<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.970> warm<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.510> if<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:39.870> if

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you dry but warm because if you're if

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
you dry but warm because if you're if
you're<00:01:40.229> wet<00:01:40.560> while<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.280> body's<00:01:41.640> trying<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you're wet while your body's trying to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
you're wet while your body's trying to
stay<00:01:42.120> warm<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.479> happens<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.049> clammy

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
stay warm what happens is you get clammy

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.990 
stay warm what happens is you get clammy
and<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.830> very<00:01:44.100> uncomfortable<00:01:44.700> feeling

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and that's a very uncomfortable feeling

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.410 
and that's a very uncomfortable feeling
so<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.960> look<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.260> shoulder<00:01:46.670> round<00:01:47.670> knit<00:01:47.940> 3d

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so we look at the shoulder round knit 3d

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.000 
so we look at the shoulder round knit 3d
map<00:01:48.659> look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.440> elbow<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.860> go

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
map look at where the elbow would go

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.399 
map look at where the elbow would go
it's<00:01:50.220> round<00:01:50.940> knit<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.360> 3d<00:01:51.810> map<00:01:52.020> again

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it's round knit it's 3d map again

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's round knit it's 3d map again
creating<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.010> air<00:01:53.310> gap<00:01:53.580> if<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.390> bring<00:01:54.570> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
creating that air gap if we bring it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.910 
creating that air gap if we bring it
back<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:54.990> chest<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.650> men's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920

it's<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.590> tough<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.040> are

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
it's going to be tough because these are

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's going to be tough because these are
dark<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.790> i'm<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> show<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.479> when

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
we do the cutaway that we have different

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.130 
we do the cutaway that we have different

it's<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.330> different<00:02:12.480> perforation<00:02:13.110> scheme

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's a different perforation scheme
