a little bit weird you know like just
things<00:00:16.920> he<00:00:17.039> does<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.390> he<00:00:18.510> knows

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
things he does and the things he knows

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.420 
things he does and the things he knows
smart<00:00:19.109> guy<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.410> don't<00:00:19.590> dive<00:00:19.770> much<00:00:19.949> tells<00:00:20.369> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
smart guy you don't dive much tells you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.560 
smart guy you don't dive much tells you
about<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.670> tells<00:00:20.970> me<00:00:21.060> about<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.420> day<00:00:21.449> long

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
about it tells me about it all day long

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050 
about it tells me about it all day long
so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.289> guess<00:00:23.130> he<00:00:23.220> learned<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> few<00:00:23.670> things<00:00:23.730> over

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
so I guess he learned a few things over

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
so I guess he learned a few things over
there<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.449> close<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
there so I'm close I'm like that I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.480 
there so I'm close I'm like that I
probably<00:00:25.949> tannery<00:00:26.400> glass<00:00:27.019> because<00:00:28.279> he's<00:00:29.279> from

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
probably tannery glass because he's from

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.380 
probably tannery glass because he's from
Regina<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:31.099> he's<00:00:32.099> been<00:00:32.399> playing<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Regina and he's been playing a lot of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
Regina and he's been playing a lot of
door<00:00:33.809> stuff<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.649> had<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> climb<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.340> mountain

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
door stuff you had to climb a mountain

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
door stuff you had to climb a mountain
this<00:00:35.910> summer<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> Africa<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this summer and it's out of Africa so I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.290 
this summer and it's out of Africa so I
think<00:00:38.280> he's<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.760> guy<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.180> could

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think he's probably the guy that could

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.760 
think he's probably the guy that could
survive<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.629> longest<00:00:40.700> probably<00:00:41.700> uh<00:00:42.770> Ballard

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
survive the longest probably uh Ballard

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
survive the longest probably uh Ballard
because<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.120> he's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> guy<00:00:45.570> who<00:00:45.629> doesn't

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
because you do he's a guy who doesn't

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
because you do he's a guy who doesn't
shower<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.640> fit<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:51.079> yeah

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
shower much so it fit right in yeah

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
shower much so it fit right in yeah
mostly<00:00:52.620> showering<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> big<00:00:53.430> part<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
mostly showering is a big part of it you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
mostly showering is a big part of it you
know<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.710> some<00:00:55.920> guys<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
know I don't know some guys that

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
know I don't know some guys that
probably<00:00:56.579> living<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.969> Alberta<00:00:57.420> Saskatchewan

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
probably living in Alberta Saskatchewan

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.720 
probably living in Alberta Saskatchewan
or<00:00:58.620> something<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.280> grew<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.520> there

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
or something I can they grew up there

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.209 
or something I can they grew up there
like<00:00:59.940> mace<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.829> those<00:01:01.980> guys<00:01:02.190> they

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
like mace and and those guys they

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
like mace and and those guys they
probably<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.270> able<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.449> handle<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.870> better

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
probably be able to handle it better

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
probably be able to handle it better
first<00:01:04.920> let<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> voted<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.670> probably<00:01:06.390> say

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
first let me get voted off probably say

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
first let me get voted off probably say
probably<00:01:07.590> Mason<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:09.210> seems<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
probably Mason just seems there's just a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
probably Mason just seems there's just a
little<00:01:10.619> baby<00:01:10.770> something<00:01:11.250> else<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.240> know

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
little baby something else I don't know

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
little baby something else I don't know
every<00:01:13.049> kind<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> bug<00:01:13.590> genre<00:01:13.950> hurts<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
every kind of bug genre hurts and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
every kind of bug genre hurts and
mushroom<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.700> say<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> nice<00:01:15.689> tall<00:01:15.900> guy<00:01:16.080> who

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
mushroom you say this nice tall guy who

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.960 
mushroom you say this nice tall guy who
made<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.610> something<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
made that but I don't something like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
made that but I don't something like
that<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.240> probably<00:01:18.900> Roberto<00:01:19.439> because

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that I think probably Roberto because

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
that I think probably Roberto because
you<00:01:20.189> wanted<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> easy<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.119> him<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you wanted to make it easy on him I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
you wanted to make it easy on him I
think<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.439> wouldn't<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.740> happy<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.520> we

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
think you wouldn't be happy there so we

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.560 
think you wouldn't be happy there so we
just<00:01:24.140> tell<00:01:25.140> him<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.979> home<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.580> he

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
just tell him you got to go home so he

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.859 
just tell him you got to go home so he
can<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> he<00:01:28.290> computer<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.840> no<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
can go and he computer a little bit no I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.499 
can go and he computer a little bit no I
doubt<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.440 

Mason<00:01:36.509> Raymond<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.409> probably<00:01:38.450> misses

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
Mason Raymond probably probably misses

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
Mason Raymond probably probably misses
organic<00:01:39.960> food<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:41.040> wouldn't<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.610> enough
