00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
Testament and which weren't right it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.250

it's<00:04:57.560> fascinating<00:04:57.740> for<00:04:58.310> people<00:04:58.670> I<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:59.150> when

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's fascinating for people I think when

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.110 
it's fascinating for people I think when
people<00:04:59.300> study<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.140> learn<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.160> opens<00:05:01.970> up

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
people study that learn that it opens up

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.690 
people study that learn that it opens up
I<00:05:02.300> mean<00:05:02.660> some<00:05:02.840> people<00:05:03.080> fear<00:05:03.290> that<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.800> think<00:05:04.610> we

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
I mean some people fear that I think we

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.830 
I mean some people fear that I think we
shouldn't<00:05:04.940> fear<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.330> think<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:05.810> should

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
shouldn't fear that I think we should

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.540 
shouldn't fear that I think we should
especially<00:05:06.530> if<00:05:06.770> we<00:05:06.890> think<00:05:07.100> that<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.370> Holy

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
especially if we think that the Holy

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.000 
especially if we think that the Holy
Spirit<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.240> somehow<00:05:08.990> active<00:05:09.470> in<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.650> world<00:05:09.830> I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
Spirit is somehow active in the world I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.220 
Spirit is somehow active in the world I
think<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.430> trust<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.090> Holy<00:05:11.210> Spirit<00:05:11.780> is<00:05:11.960> going

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
think you trust the Holy Spirit is going

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.830 
think you trust the Holy Spirit is going
to<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.680> know<00:05:13.000> safeguard<00:05:14.000> your<00:05:14.150> faith<00:05:14.450> in<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
to you know safeguard your faith in the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.300 
to you know safeguard your faith in the
midst<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.140> your<00:05:15.290> sanity<00:05:15.650> well<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:15.920> think<00:05:16.040> that

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
midst of your sanity well I think that

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.120 
midst of your sanity well I think that
what<00:05:16.580> perhaps<00:05:17.540> some<00:05:17.780> folks<00:05:18.020> would<00:05:18.230> be<00:05:18.440> afraid

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
what perhaps some folks would be afraid

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.300 
what perhaps some folks would be afraid
of<00:05:19.310> is<00:05:19.460> if<00:05:19.640> you<00:05:19.790> you<00:05:20.630> start<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.990> unpack<00:05:21.310> what

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
of is if you you start to unpack what

then all of a sudden now you know
everything<00:05:28.460> falls<00:05:29.060> apart<00:05:29.150> but<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.930> know<00:05:30.020> that

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230

might<00:05:33.260> call<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.620> second<00:05:34.070> reading<00:05:34.310> where<00:05:35.150> you

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
might call a second reading where you

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.140 
might call a second reading where you
you<00:05:36.800> acquire<00:05:37.070> all<00:05:37.250> this<00:05:37.400> information<00:05:37.700> but

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
you acquire all this information but

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.450 
you acquire all this information but
then<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.390> sort<00:05:38.600> of<00:05:38.720> Brac<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.440> out<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:40.070> lot<00:05:40.340> of

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
then you sort of Brac it out a lot of

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.100 
then you sort of Brac it out a lot of
that<00:05:40.580> information<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.390> then<00:05:41.600> reread<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
that information and then reread the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.200 
that information and then reread the
gospel<00:05:42.530> from<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.800> new<00:05:42.920> perspective<00:05:42.950> I<00:05:43.610> think

they're difficult enough to figure out

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.910 
they're difficult enough to figure out
much<00:06:37.940> less<00:06:38.270> trying<00:06:38.660> to<00:06:38.780> like<00:06:38.960> get<00:06:39.650> to<00:06:39.830> the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
much less trying to like get to the

things<00:06:41.479> that<00:06:41.870> happen<00:06:42.199> behind<00:06:42.380> them<00:06:42.740> I'm

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
things that happen behind them I'm

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.010 
things that happen behind them I'm
interested<00:06:43.460> in<00:06:43.490> actually<00:06:43.810> talking<00:06:44.810> about

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
interested in actually talking about

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.499 
interested in actually talking about
that<00:06:45.440> very<00:06:45.740> text<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.430> when<00:06:46.580> you<00:06:47.030> do<00:06:47.240> that<00:06:47.479> I

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
that very text and when you do that I

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.990 
that very text and when you do that I
think<00:06:47.900> you<00:06:48.020> have<00:06:48.259> what<00:06:49.039> you're<00:06:49.190> referring<00:06:49.639> to

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
think you have what you're referring to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.120 
think you have what you're referring to
i<00:06:50.030> think<00:06:50.150> is<00:06:50.360> this<00:06:50.539> second<00:06:51.199> reading<00:06:51.860> the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
i think is this second reading the

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.370 
i think is this second reading the
second<00:06:52.699> naïveté<00:06:53.449> where<00:06:53.660> you<00:06:53.780> can<00:06:53.960> now<00:06:54.110> come

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
second naïveté where you can now come

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.439 
second naïveté where you can now come
back<00:06:54.530> to<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.800> texts<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:55.370> you're<00:06:55.910> not<00:06:55.970> worried

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
back to the texts and you're not worried

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.420 
back to the texts and you're not worried
about<00:06:56.509> all<00:06:56.870> those<00:06:57.139> debates<00:06:57.380> of<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.979> Jesus

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
about all those debates of the Jesus

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.520 
about all those debates of the Jesus
Seminar<00:06:58.610> versus<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.509> fundamentalist<00:07:00.259> about

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
Seminar versus the fundamentalist about

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.110 
Seminar versus the fundamentalist about
yes<00:07:00.979> it<00:07:01.099> really<00:07:01.220> did<00:07:01.460> happen<00:07:01.610> no<00:07:01.910> it<00:07:02.000> really

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
yes it really did happen no it really

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.870 
yes it really did happen no it really
didn't<00:07:02.419> happen<00:07:02.690> go<00:07:02.840> look<00:07:03.500> let's<00:07:04.490> look<00:07:04.610> at<00:07:04.759> what

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
didn't happen go look let's look at what

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.550 
didn't happen go look let's look at what
we<00:07:04.970> actually<00:07:05.150> have<00:07:05.509> the<00:07:05.690> text<00:07:06.110> and<00:07:06.289> let's

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
we actually have the text and let's

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.260 
we actually have the text and let's
figure<00:07:06.770> this<00:07:06.919> out<00:07:07.069> together<00:07:07.250> what<00:07:07.970> we<00:07:08.060> need<00:07:08.210> to

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
figure this out together what we need to

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.939 
figure this out together what we need to
take<00:07:08.360> a<00:07:08.569> break<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.319> we're<00:07:09.470> going<00:07:09.590> to<00:07:09.650> get<00:07:09.740> more

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
take a break and we're going to get more

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.980 
take a break and we're going to get more
into<00:07:10.250> it<00:07:10.280> after<00:07:10.490> this<00:07:10.819> with<00:07:11.210> Tony<00:07:11.419> Jones<00:07:11.660> don't

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
into it after this with Tony Jones don't

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.319 
into it after this with Tony Jones don't
go<00:07:12.110> anywhere
