there's<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.110> power<00:02:44.319> brick<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:44.890> still<00:02:45.190> huge

the<00:02:48.280> non<00:02:48.519> slim<00:02:49.530> Xbox<00:02:50.530> 360<00:02:51.340> before<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.269> I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the non slim Xbox 360 before this so I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.880 
the non slim Xbox 360 before this so I
guess<00:02:52.750> that's<00:02:52.989> an<00:02:53.110> improvement<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.709> very

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
guess that's an improvement and a very

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.530 
guess that's an improvement and a very
weird<00:02:54.220> connector<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.030> now<00:02:55.180> look<00:02:55.360> at<00:02:55.450> this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
weird connector on that now look at this

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.050 
weird connector on that now look at this
I<00:02:55.780> think<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.320> good<00:02:56.560> value<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.730> get<00:02:57.910> all

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I think this is a good value you get all

for 399 if you don't have an Xbox 360
this<00:03:05.739> might<00:03:06.069> be<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> time<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.640> dive<00:03:07.180> right<00:03:07.510> in
