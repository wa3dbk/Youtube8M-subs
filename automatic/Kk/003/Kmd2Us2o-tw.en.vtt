 hello and welcome to geek newspaper 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 those years i'm with greg ocs 2013 on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.670
 is currently on the sharp stand 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.400
 with the famous booth ix at then exo this 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 are the sharp screens for for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.599
 everything that is mobile devices and there 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.929
 we're actually in front of a screen 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.369
 a 10.1-inch screen prototype 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.820
 ultra sensitive you have to know something 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.660
 is that the exo screens of cat 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 why do we talk about it the weather is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 because they have a product the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 first quality is that it consumes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 very little energy behind they have 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.130
 a very high definition so there was no 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 not the numbers but basically ca 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.240
 it's all about retina and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.040
 or even more is the last thing 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.540
 it is especially super sensitive 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.940
 so to show you the super 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.430
 sensitivity of this screen we just have a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.040
 simple pencil 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 the up one can use a pencil to 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.840
 paper to write directly on 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 the screen 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 so you can see that's when 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 even pretty impressive to see that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.620
 it's pretty sensitive obviously we can 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.910
 always x and his finger but suddenly 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.340
 we do not even need to have a style 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.670
 is specific to the less stylish wacom 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 specific bamboo style and others 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.000
 can use a simple pencil and there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.330
 you can see that it works from the fire 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 God 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.400
 and then that's pretty impressive 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 it's really very very very sensitive 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.550
 and we can see it in safer on 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.259
 the screen only at the level of the level of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.520
 display 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.080
 the display is very very small then 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.640
 unfortunately you will not see it 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.320
 not in video but in fact we have 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 several font sizes and even on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 the smallest size there we distinguish 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.479
 clearly distinguishes the characters 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.140
 I think that's about all 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.910
 so if you have other questions 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.910
 do not hesitate / the geek's diary
