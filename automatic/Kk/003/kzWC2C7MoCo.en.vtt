it's<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> reticle<00:00:49.670> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> nice<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.360> know

it makes it more gamer ish rather than

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
it makes it more gamer ish rather than
like<00:00:53.670> looking<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> chess<00:00:54.600> piece<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
like looking like a chess piece at the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
like looking like a chess piece at the
same<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.699> guess<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.600> unlike<00:00:58.109> an

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
same time I guess this is unlike an

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
same time I guess this is unlike an
aluminum<00:00:59.070> metal<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.820> something<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
aluminum metal or something like that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.579 
aluminum metal or something like that
you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> bottom<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
you can see at the bottom here is this

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.310 
you can see at the bottom here is this
cushiony<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.189> prevents<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
cushiony thing and this prevents the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
cushiony thing and this prevents the
metal<00:01:07.320> piece<00:01:07.619> from<00:01:08.060> scratching<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.180> screen

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
metal piece from scratching your screen

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
metal piece from scratching your screen

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which would be the worst situation

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.969 
which would be the worst situation
possible<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.970> I've<00:01:12.420> played<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> just

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
possible and I've played with it just

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.210 
possible and I've played with it just

three<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.280> four<00:01:50.549> inch<00:01:50.790> size<00:01:51.090> screen<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.600> not

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
three to four inch size screen I'm not

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.149 
three to four inch size screen I'm not
one<00:01:51.840> hundred<00:01:51.930> percent<00:01:52.110> sure<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.860> samsung

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
one hundred percent sure it's a samsung

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
one hundred percent sure it's a samsung
focus<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.689> you'll<00:01:54.990> notice<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> takes<00:01:55.590> up

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
focus so you'll notice that it takes up

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
focus so you'll notice that it takes up
a<00:01:55.860> huge<00:01:56.070> portion<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> screen<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.750> larger

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
a huge portion of the screen much larger

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
a huge portion of the screen much larger
than<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.439> regular<00:01:58.619> normal<00:01:59.250> thumb<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.820> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
than your regular normal thumb would so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
than your regular normal thumb would so
it's<00:02:01.200> questionable<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.430> might<00:02:02.820> not

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it's questionable that you might not

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's questionable that you might not
want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.869> play<00:02:04.110> games<00:02:04.409> using<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
want to play games using this on a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
want to play games using this on a
smaller<00:02:06.570> screen<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.170> you're<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.469> your

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
smaller screen but if you're on your

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.150 
smaller screen but if you're on your

you know tablet screen you can see that

you know tablet screen you can see that
that's<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.980> decent<00:02:17.730> size<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> takes<00:02:18.810> up

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that's a decent size that it takes up

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.810 
that's a decent size that it takes up
you<00:02:19.230> know<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.650> mean<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.280> worst<00:02:20.490> in

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
you know I mean it's not the worst in

you know I mean it's not the worst in
the<00:02:20.910> world<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.720> acceptable<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:24.510> I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the world so it's acceptable and what I

the world so it's acceptable and what I
did<00:02:24.810> notice<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.470> playing<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.950> was<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
did notice that of playing this was that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840 
did notice that of playing this was that
you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.380> only<00:02:28.560> rotate<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.520> right<00:02:29.760> you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
you can only rotate like this right you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.600 
you can only rotate like this right you
can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.620> joystick<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.250> moving

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
can see that the joystick is moving

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.000 
can see that the joystick is moving
around<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.390> move<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.660> around<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.410> when

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
around you move it around right and when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.730 
around you move it around right and when
you're<00:02:35.190> controlling<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.880> game<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.810> didn't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
you're controlling a game I I didn't

necessarily see any sort of specific
games<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.350> work<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.370> joystick<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
games at work with this joystick that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.060 
games at work with this joystick that
are<00:02:42.360> specifically<00:02:42.840> meant<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.530> joystick

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
are specifically meant for this joystick

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.430 
are specifically meant for this joystick
so<00:02:44.580> your<00:02:44.760> typical<00:02:45.090> game<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.660> meant<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.320> your

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so your typical game is meant for your

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.260 
so your typical game is meant for your
thumb<00:02:46.710> with<00:02:47.220> your<00:02:47.370> thumb<00:02:47.670> say<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.180> you're

thumb with your thumb say that you're

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.930 
thumb with your thumb say that you're
moving<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:49.080> paddle<00:02:49.890> around<00:02:50.340> right<00:02:50.670> in

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
moving like a paddle around right in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.730 
moving like a paddle around right in
order<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.600> move<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.960> paddle<00:02:52.320> all<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> way

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
order to move that paddle all the way

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620 
order to move that paddle all the way
from<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.670> side<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> screen<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
from this side of the screen to that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970 
from this side of the screen to that
side<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.990> screen<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.620> move<00:02:55.800> your

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
side of the screen you have to move your

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.100 
side of the screen you have to move your
finger<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.760> from<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.720> side<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:57.990> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
finger all the way from one side of the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.490 
finger all the way from one side of the
screen<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> other<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.580> joystick

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
screen to the other with this joystick

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.870 
screen to the other with this joystick
you'll<00:03:01.500> notice<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.010> can<00:03:02.100> only<00:03:02.400> move<00:03:02.640> to

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you'll notice that you can only move to

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.370 
you'll notice that you can only move to
the<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.570> much<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.260> only

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
the right this much and you can only

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.470 
the right this much and you can only
move<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.770> left<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.550> much<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.330> your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
move to the left this much so your

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.030 
move to the left this much so your
paddle<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.960> basically<00:03:07.410> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.680> move<00:03:07.830> from

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
paddle is basically going to move from

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.670 
paddle is basically going to move from
here<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.600> not<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.050> move<00:03:10.200> all

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
here to here it's not going to move all

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.710 
here to here it's not going to move all
the<00:03:11.130> way<00:03:11.160> across<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.880> screen<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.270> least<00:03:12.510> with

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the way across the screen at least with

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240 
the way across the screen at least with
the<00:03:12.870> games<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.320> are<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.620> currently

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
the games that are out there currently

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.120 
the games that are out there currently
so<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.390> huge<00:03:15.420> problem<00:03:16.110> when<00:03:17.010> you're

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so that's a huge problem when you're

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.620 
so that's a huge problem when you're
using<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.610> controller<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> almost

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
using this controller so it almost

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.470 
using this controller so it almost
becomes<00:03:19.140> like<00:03:19.400> what<00:03:20.400> kind<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.850> games<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.420> i

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
becomes like what kind of games can i

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.390 
becomes like what kind of games can i
use<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.959> order<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.070> are<00:03:23.190> really

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
use in order that that are really

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000 
use in order that that are really
compatible<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.050> joystick<00:03:25.320> I'm<00:03:25.800> not

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
compatible with this joystick I'm not

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.580 
compatible with this joystick I'm not

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
one hundred percent sure hopefully

one hundred percent sure hopefully
thinkgeek<00:03:28.590> has<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:29.160> list<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.270> do<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.810> will

thinkgeek has a list if they do I will

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.480 
thinkgeek has a list if they do I will
put<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> description<00:03:31.770> field<00:03:32.400> below

and you know maybe they'll update that
in<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> future<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.730> that'd<00:03:35.850> be<00:03:36.030> wonderful<00:03:36.270> if

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
in the future so that'd be wonderful if

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.940 
in the future so that'd be wonderful if
they<00:03:36.720> if<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.770> look

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
they if they have that I have to look

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.750 
they if they have that I have to look
into<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.150> besides<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.130> yeah<00:03:41.130> i<00:03:41.400> mean<00:03:41.610> i

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
into it but besides that yeah i mean i

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.240 
into it but besides that yeah i mean i
like<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.330> idea<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> joystick<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:43.770> very

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
like the idea of the joystick it's very

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.030 
like the idea of the joystick it's very
comfortable<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:45.390> thumb<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:46.020> not<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.890> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
comfortable your thumb is not going to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.010 
comfortable your thumb is not going to
be<00:03:47.250> sliding<00:03:47.760> around<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.540> does<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
be sliding around like it does on the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.770 
be sliding around like it does on the
screen<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.830> know<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.910> might<00:03:51.090> miss<00:03:51.450> and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
screen and you know you might miss and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.750 
screen and you know you might miss and
hit<00:03:52.230> something<00:03:52.560> else<00:03:52.920> on<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> screen<00:03:53.580> and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
hit something else on the screen and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.880 
hit something else on the screen and
that's<00:03:54.180> always<00:03:54.390> frustrating<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
that's always frustrating so this is a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.660 
that's always frustrating so this is a
really<00:03:56.130> nice<00:03:56.720> way<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.780> play<00:03:58.350> video<00:03:59.100> games<00:03:59.370> if

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
really nice way to play video games if

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.880 
really nice way to play video games if
you<00:04:00.270> could<00:04:00.480> actually<00:04:00.720> play<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.470> video<00:04:01.709> game

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
you could actually play the video game

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.070 
you could actually play the video game
correctly<00:04:02.280> without<00:04:02.880> any<00:04:03.270> problems<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.930> right

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
correctly without any problems but right

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.500 
correctly without any problems but right
now<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.980> do<00:04:05.160> have<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:05.670> problems<00:04:06.090> depending

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
now you do have some problems depending

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.660 
now you do have some problems depending
upon<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.989> game<00:04:07.170> itself<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.890> that's<00:04:08.040> something

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
upon the game itself so that's something

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.630 
upon the game itself so that's something
to<00:04:08.820> look<00:04:08.910> into<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:10.470> you're<00:04:10.770> thinking<00:04:11.370> about
