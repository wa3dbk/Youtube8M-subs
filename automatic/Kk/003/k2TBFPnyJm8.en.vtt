00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
this that distance will get shorter and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
this that distance will get shorter and
shorter<00:01:26.300> one<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> goals<00:01:27.690> we<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.200> do

tag end this being the tag this being
the<00:01:40.440> standing<00:01:40.920> line<00:01:41.210> around<00:01:42.210> we're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the standing line around we're going to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
the standing line around we're going to
wrap<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> tag<00:01:43.740> around<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.430> standing<00:01:44.880> line<00:01:45.060> I

wrap the tag around the standing line I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.260 
wrap the tag around the standing line I
also<00:01:46.380> find<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.010> easier<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.760> I<00:01:47.909> hold<00:01:48.090> the

just<00:05:01.729> push<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.270> over<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:03.760> back<00:05:04.760> through<00:05:05.510> that

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
just push it over and back through that

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.580 
just push it over and back through that
loop<00:05:06.169> opening<00:05:07.479> once<00:05:08.479> you're<00:05:08.660> here<00:05:08.870> grab<00:05:09.440> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
loop opening once you're here grab the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.409 
loop opening once you're here grab the
tag<00:05:09.860> end<00:05:15.039> helps<00:05:16.039> me<00:05:16.220> if<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.520> switch<00:05:16.820> hands<00:05:17.120> now

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
tag end helps me if I switch hands now

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.719 
tag end helps me if I switch hands now
and<00:05:17.979> draw<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.039> knot<00:05:19.340> together<00:05:21.610> once<00:05:22.610> you're

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
and draw the knot together once you're

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.250 
and draw the knot together once you're
not<00:05:22.880> starts<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.390> come<00:05:23.510> up<00:05:23.539> towards<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.080> eye<00:05:24.110> of

not starts to come up towards the eye of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.120 
not starts to come up towards the eye of
the<00:05:24.530> fly<00:05:24.760> drop<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.000> tag<00:05:26.240> end<00:05:26.800> hanging<00:05:27.800> on<00:05:27.919> to

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
the fly drop the tag end hanging on to

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.279 
the fly drop the tag end hanging on to
the<00:05:28.250> fly<00:05:28.490> securely<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.510> doesn't<00:05:29.870> embed

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
the fly securely so it doesn't embed

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.279 
the fly securely so it doesn't embed
itself<00:05:30.530> in<00:05:30.890> your<00:05:31.070> finger<00:05:31.430> or<00:05:31.580> thumb<00:05:32.110> pull<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
itself in your finger or thumb pull the

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.680 
itself in your finger or thumb pull the
standing<00:05:33.800> line<00:05:33.979> and<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.610> fly<00:05:34.850> opposing<00:05:35.539> each

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
standing line and the fly opposing each

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:45.659 
standing line and the fly opposing each
other<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:41.510> knot<00:05:41.690> comes<00:05:41.990> together

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.959 

one<00:05:46.240> of<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.389> reasons<00:05:46.689> I<00:05:46.780> like<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.199> knot<00:05:47.439> is

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
one of the reasons I like this knot is

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.309 
one of the reasons I like this knot is
because<00:05:48.969> if<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.150> hook<00:05:49.330> into<00:05:49.539> a<00:05:49.689> big<00:05:49.930> trophy

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
because if I hook into a big trophy

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.719 
because if I hook into a big trophy
trout<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:51.270> my<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.539> I<00:05:52.599> and<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:53.349> tag<00:05:53.740> end<00:05:54.099> if<00:05:54.340> it

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
trout in my and I and the tag end if it

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.959 
trout in my and I and the tag end if it
has<00:05:55.000> worked<00:05:55.569> its<00:05:55.840> way<00:05:56.189> through<00:05:57.189> the<00:05:57.400> second

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
has worked its way through the second

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.570 
has worked its way through the second
loop<00:05:58.210> right<00:05:58.479> here<00:05:58.919> that<00:05:59.919> means<00:06:00.069> that<00:06:00.219> it<00:06:00.430> has

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
loop right here that means that it has

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.730 
loop right here that means that it has
to<00:06:00.789> go<00:06:00.819> through<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.629> first<00:06:01.990> loop<00:06:02.319> that<00:06:02.590> we

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
to go through the first loop that we

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.490 
to go through the first loop that we
went<00:06:02.979> through<00:06:03.270> so<00:06:04.270> basically<00:06:05.020> it's<00:06:05.229> just<00:06:05.409> a

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
went through so basically it's just a

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.610 
went through so basically it's just a
safety<00:06:05.770> net<00:06:06.099> for<00:06:06.159> my<00:06:06.550> knot<00:06:07.020> trim<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.169> tag<00:06:08.319> off

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
safety net for my knot trim the tag off

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.469 
safety net for my knot trim the tag off
again<00:06:09.069> I<00:06:09.219> like<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.520> leave<00:06:09.669> about<00:06:09.939> a<00:06:09.969> sixteenth

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
again I like to leave about a sixteenth

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.890 
again I like to leave about a sixteenth
of<00:06:10.629> an<00:06:10.780> inch<00:06:10.900> as<00:06:11.460> I<00:06:12.460> fly<00:06:12.699> as<00:06:12.969> I<00:06:13.120> cast<00:06:13.419> the<00:06:13.629> fly<00:06:13.840> it

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
of an inch as I fly as I cast the fly it

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.110 
of an inch as I fly as I cast the fly it
might<00:06:14.259> tighten<00:06:14.650> up<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.889> little<00:06:15.069> bit<00:06:15.250> more<00:06:15.460> the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
might tighten up a little bit more the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.509 
might tighten up a little bit more the
clinch<00:06:16.419> knot
