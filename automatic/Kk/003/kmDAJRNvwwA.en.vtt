00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 what three vehicles played against worthy 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.610
 from Iran and for now this is the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.559
 Following the best we can say 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 that in the killing was considered 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.970
 the best am so ardent this essay 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 3 why we had to give a failure 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.060
 because these three years loses a little the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060
 white wire 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.290
 for example there are parties or 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.200
 blacks played immediately foessel 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.329
 but even there a part of kasparov 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.719
 but in the same position as two 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.699
 we saw in the party a year 400 the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
 white days crazy two big wheels 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.399
 and after that it's pretty important that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.620
 crazy 2 can go out in c3 anyway 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.039
 by case after in the nascent blacks 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.329
 finally the white oven on the big 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 saga is not strong enough 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.589
 while they did 3 it's still 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.539
 you can the good box of crazy and of course 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.979
 also the second network that the lady 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.289
 is not protected putting the lady 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 white is also still photo 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.610
 plays a role that sometimes on the screen the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 whites can not pursue without 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 than going there variants or karin 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.679
 yes okay it's very interesting for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.149
 the blacks to force the blow is you 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.069
 that's the precision of the ten days 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:35.130
 it was analyze you play it this 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.970
 position because he analyzed the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.009
 most end then after whip this the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.009
 white for plants 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.090
 here he says ready was not the crazy 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:02:00.830
 the two days of the run and I managed 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:06.590
 for blacks it takes and now a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.729
 year to play big here it is here that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.620
 exchanged in relation to this time the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.430
 trench but here it's not easy before 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 of course now I want to explain 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 why change it because it exists 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 now what can I call as 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.599
 syndrom 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.410
 we can give the name of the best 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.989
 current software or denial is to say 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.959
 that they players in little bit afraid of 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.489
 preparation by country here a landais 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.260
 who play against their computer 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.650
 banks play against four hundred 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.930
 400 who was finally preparing mans 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.510
 everything checked with the computer it's him 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.190
 to say that already the players in France 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.620
 and just think about saying more 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.130
 tiring for blacks jacques they 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.500
 same 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.380
 you have to be careful that's it too 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 that it's still the computer of and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.910
 the dangerous ones 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.069
 so how did a warrant understand that 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:20.230
 it's for those alas not play a 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:22.709
 world knows we can say that even I 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.709
 think that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.620
 it was reasonable because he did not 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.900
 not much to almost 1 2 example 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.970
 see here and play it europe but we 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.520
 can dream even why the guards 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.980
 since I found a variable on 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.320
 the year to almost 1 me 2 what are they saying 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.910
 iran despite his senses and I think that 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.460
 still after his 100 he had 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.520
 some problems because a world not 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.920
 more protected after black by sacrificing 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.960
 the pawns and apprehend a little protected 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.230
 this pawn with buzz because it's shameful 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.490
 complicated so I think that's it can 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.120
 not be too much in the details 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.120
 on his wii but never a long time 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.250
 and I did the same for the reasons 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.680
 that why we did not play for rent 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.370
 changed like him analyzed he was 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.900
 sure 400 to analyze or here and there 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:24.990
 find better shot in my opinion 70 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:27.120
 hundred walking and with that of course that the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.530
 blacks a composition and why the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.620
 blacks can recreate now because 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.590
 that they asked me the question because 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.380
 that at 6.10 on m6 has publicly and 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.510
 the whites can attack the euro 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.419
 cotnoir but the problem of plants 6 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.060
 is the pre roll to g3 if we do not place you 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.200
 election and I found a lack 3 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.630
 it's over right now it is 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.530
 white wins more or less easily than 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.390
 this show is accurate the g4 I feel 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.580
 the jumper g3 spoils it all 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.140
 the excellent the cavaly which has no good 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.550
 headphone is now the best frame 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.850
 for this chaos and its cavals and the cac 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.850
 40 could have prejudged their 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.960
 sure earned we will see part because 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.710
 as 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.890
 then you have to improve this 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.800
 jumper after 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.270
 high jumper g6 the high shot here 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.770
 that's about it can be said that the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.650
 same and hoÃ«dic 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.240
 I explained for the other position the 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.730
 blacks can block because the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.040
 riders g3 is misplaced and the 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.590
 whites do not have time to push 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.930
 g4 g5 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.150
 it is necessary to improve the riders then the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.800
 cable the uqat jumper returns to the center 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.140
 its logic but I talked about the jacks 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.420
 every exchange improved are more 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.800
 fine black defense 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.110
 yes so that's an important rule 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.240
 we can give the missing player 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.580
 of space exchanged maximum of your 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.340
 nieces that means that even when he 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.400
 have to dig a little more than two pieces 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.650
 for whites for that because after 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.330
 we walk world space for blacks 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.240
 but with few coins each piece 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.240
 black can find a good box that 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.419
 would be the rule is awesome after 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.190
 cavagnoud 4 nor if they go maybe he has 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.980
 received a line with a guy 3 but 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.190
 that's the effect it's already showing 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.380
 a name does not have a game of repeating the font 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.720
 as in avatar did not repeat the 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.480
 party against the Chinese player with 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.060
 weapons on May 2 a single china have little 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.590
 already afraid of preparation because 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.250
 stopped on a few do very well 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.830
 prepared then she did not play instead 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.800
 of Calais has only four white 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.169
 the subject of a brief 3 a few more parties 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.600
 or less interesting but he did not 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.970
 wanted to complicate the game is for him I 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.070
 think he was already satisfied and has 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.440
 seen in little bit the opening that 400 to 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.120
 prepare fart schott for the match at 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.060
 level it's not sure that now we 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.180
 does not live that goes away then vary 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.810
 rider e 4 savalli takes 1.4 of a 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.490
 point four missions for blacks 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.270
 all the sauce between the rider 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.470
 transcends 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:16.800
 we exchange all then learns to 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:19.300
 blood and in the obvious descent that 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.480
 here it was the last moment where we 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:28.600
 could still be proud of a g4 but there 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:32.910
 not you in the 4.3 h7 is to be expected 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.910
 an example still the position 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.630
 stated for example this is a 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.460
 possibility but his paws read everything 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.210
 that he was going to say where I feel that after 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:45.250
 its 100 years it must be said that after 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.820
 angers 4 or 7 to counter the threat 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:53.020
 or takes 1 6 3 protects well and two 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.640
 now it's 100 here is the game is 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.920
 now it's the guides for the 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.830
 nuts like the blacks had left 6th 

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.480
 after the blacks and by his senses for 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.200
 attack conditions cards here 

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.670
 black people 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.120
 three of the four whites can 

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:10.270
 find the chances go go kings 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.130
 with objects four towers h 3to center 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.600
 I do not think it's necessary for them 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.580
 blacks do not wait long 

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.860
 we must attack the center after these 

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.860
 centers it's a higuain position
