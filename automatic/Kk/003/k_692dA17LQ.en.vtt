00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.440
 in america they are all stars and it is a 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.230
 It's a shame that King Bravo does not feel that way 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.850
 in an institution such as pumas is 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 how does christian benitez respond 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.050
 forward of the eagles to the rat then 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.440
 to say that college students do not 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.650
 there are stars but if set game 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.650
 what in all equipment there are stars and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 good if you do not want to feel like 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 like a star 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 apart from not being in any institution 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 I hope that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.270
 and players in a good institution without 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 feel stars because 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.630
 in america and today any companion 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.450
 we are stars and obviously for something 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 you are in one of the best and in the 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.260
 payroll do not play or cristian at the end and at 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.450
 end of the day in which you are more 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.830
 million or less million this the payroll 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.120
 he does not care when he steals the ball in a 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:06.660
 classic that's the least I think he 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.440
 he focuses on playing on his team and mine 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.080
 why 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.820
 each player at the time that the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.130
 alba are al picasso full 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.300
 he does not remember anything and tries to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.220
 do it on the court the best what 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.120
 is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.010
 no more to see as he said in the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.860
 that any player who is in a 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.920
 great club is a star but 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.960
 obviously as I can because they say 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.780
 is not divorced being a star with 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.400
 having the set game 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.710
 america has game set I think 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.220
 that all teams do not have if not 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.170
 we were a team if they were accompanied 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.380
 nor was it a game because all the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.200
 teams like stars only one 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.650
 moment is that they take out individualities 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.510
 each and equal 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.220
 last good of your words like this is 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.960
 a bit like the top that does not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.280
 feels the best star being able to be 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 in an institution as well as cougars that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.180
 has not feel the truth that 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.989
 I feel very sorry that no no 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 no no no I do not see how great a player he is and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.760
 that he does not feel he can achieve 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 chucho wants to feed with goals to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 pumas and for test takes a bag of 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.630
 food for kittens 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.360
 It is not always good to make many goals 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.090
 we have we can what has been played 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.940
 feed them 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.010
 we hope we can give 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.660
