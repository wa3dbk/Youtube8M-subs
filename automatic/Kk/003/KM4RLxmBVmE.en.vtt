00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
let's get started so what we can see

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.609 
let's get started so what we can see
from<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.490> environment<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.779> foliage<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
from the environment and the foliage and

from the environment and the foliage and
the<00:00:23.189> buildings<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> background<00:00:24.359> it's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the buildings in the background it's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
the buildings in the background it's
likely<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.949> battle<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> taking<00:00:26.820> place

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the unit before the battle started and I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.469 
the unit before the battle started and I
believe<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.500> new<00:01:10.860> section<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
believe that this new section on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.890 
believe that this new section on the
unit<00:01:12.840> card<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.090> number<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> kills<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
unit card is the number of kills that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
unit card is the number of kills that
the<00:01:16.080> unit<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> new<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the unit has got which is new because I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
the unit has got which is new because I
don't<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.479> any<00:01:18.869> talk<00:01:19.619> war<00:01:19.920> game<00:01:20.400> countered

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
don't think any talk war game countered

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
don't think any talk war game countered
it<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> real-time<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.200> number<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> kills<00:01:22.799> who

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it in real-time the number of kills who

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
it in real-time the number of kills who
got<00:01:23.130> bought<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> end

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
got bought it would show it at the end

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
got bought it would show it at the end
of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> battle<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.710> interesting

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
of the battle so that's an interesting

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
of the battle so that's an interesting
new<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> could<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.750> pretty<00:01:28.080> fun

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
new thing that could be pretty fun

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
new thing that could be pretty fun
to<00:01:28.650> follow<00:01:28.920> along<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:30.150> actual<00:01:30.479> battle

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to follow along with in an actual battle

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
to follow along with in an actual battle

the<00:01:32.790> bottom<00:01:33.060> corner<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> there

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the bottom corner I know it's that there

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
the bottom corner I know it's that there
are<00:01:34.380> capture<00:01:34.920> points<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.759> blue<00:01:35.970> dots

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
are capture points and the blue dots

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679 
are capture points and the blue dots
that<00:01:36.720> signify<00:01:37.290> allies<00:01:37.829> most<00:01:38.250> likely<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> red

that signify allies most likely and red
dots<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.079> signify<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> enemy<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.250> has

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
dots that signify the enemy which has

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.639

been<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.000> every<00:01:42.119> talk<00:01:42.390> war<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.439> me

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
been in every talk war but what got me

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.350 
been in every talk war but what got me
was<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.310> must<00:01:44.729> mean<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
was that this must mean that this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.020 
was that this must mean that this
screenshot<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> first<00:01:47.030> settlement

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
screenshot is the first settlement

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.840 
screenshot is the first settlement
battle<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.689> we've<00:01:48.840> seen<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.890> talk<00:01:50.340> war<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
battle that we've seen from talk war so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.450 
battle that we've seen from talk war so
far<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.369> were

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
far so this could be what they were

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850 
far so this could be what they were
talking<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:53.909> instead<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.720> siege<00:01:55.409> battle

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
talking about instead of a siege battle

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
talking about instead of a siege battle
taking<00:01:56.100> place<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.729> take<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> region<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
taking place to take a region it's a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
taking place to take a region it's a
battle<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.829> takes<00:01:59.040> place<00:01:59.430> outside<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.119> town

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
battle that takes place outside the town

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
battle that takes place outside the town
which<00:02:00.810> would<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.229> sense<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
which would make sense because if you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
which would make sense because if you
look<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.579> where<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.119> army<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.259> we've

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
look at where the army is that we've

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590 
look at where the army is that we've
seen<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.829> screenshot<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.000> mini-map<00:02:06.360> we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
seen this screenshot on the mini-map we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
seen this screenshot on the mini-map we
are<00:02:06.659> outside<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.439> town<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:08.550> looking<00:02:08.970> at

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
are outside of town and now looking at

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.750 
are outside of town and now looking at
the<00:02:09.179> unit<00:02:09.569> cards<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the unit cards we can see that the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.670 
the unit cards we can see that the
triarii<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.690> selected<00:02:13.200> obvious

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
triarii I are selected obvious

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.759 
triarii I are selected obvious
and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.269> what<00:02:15.719> I<00:02:15.750> believe<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.409> think

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
and you can see what I believe I think

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.910 
and you can see what I believe I think
our<00:02:16.980> three<00:02:17.579> hosts<00:02:17.909> are<00:02:18.209> tea<00:02:18.450> units<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.439> set<00:02:19.799> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
our three hosts are tea units one set of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.940 
our three hosts are tea units one set of
principles<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.909> two<00:02:21.480> slingers<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.799> that's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
principles and two slingers so that's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.069 
principles and two slingers so that's
another<00:02:23.219> better<00:02:23.519> look<00:02:23.760> at<00:02:24.120> some<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.719> units

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
another better look at some of the units

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.839 
another better look at some of the units
hopefully<00:02:25.769> we'll<00:02:25.890> get<00:02:26.010> some<00:02:26.219> clearer<00:02:26.519> shots

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
hopefully we'll get some clearer shots

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.640 
hopefully we'll get some clearer shots
of<00:02:27.150> them<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:27.719> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.959> see<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.260> slingers

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
of them because you can see the slingers

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.649 
of them because you can see the slingers
in<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:28.980> background<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.760> her<00:02:30.030> star<00:02:30.299> T<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
in the background and her star T in the

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.390 
in the background and her star T in the
distance<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.409> because<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.859> this<00:02:31.980> screenshot

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
distance so because of this screenshot

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.330 
distance so because of this screenshot
we<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> HUD<00:02:33.719> and<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.319> controls<00:02:34.799> much

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we can see the HUD and the controls much

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.339 
we can see the HUD and the controls much
better<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.389> that<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.689> button<00:02:37.049> here

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
better and I think that this button here

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.459 
better and I think that this button here
is<00:02:37.620> probably<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.780> cinematic<00:02:39.780> mode<00:02:40.079> that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
is probably the cinematic mode that

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.709 
is probably the cinematic mode that
turns<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:41.099> like<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.609> over-the-shoulder<00:02:42.090> view

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
turns on like the over-the-shoulder view

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.199 
turns on like the over-the-shoulder view
of<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.079> soldiers<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.829> whatnot<00:02:44.219> or<00:02:44.459> another

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
of the soldiers and whatnot or another

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.890 
of the soldiers and whatnot or another
thought<00:02:45.510> could<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.079> does<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.709> capture<00:02:46.980> live

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
thought could be does it capture live

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.179 
thought could be does it capture live
moments<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.049> happen<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.470> gameplay<00:02:49.680> that's

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
moments that happen in gameplay that's

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.640 
moments that happen in gameplay that's
speculation<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.209> it's<00:02:51.569> likely<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.109> be<00:02:52.409> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
speculation but it's likely to be the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
speculation but it's likely to be the
cinematic<00:02:53.579> mode<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.389> I<00:02:54.419> know<00:02:54.540> it's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
cinematic mode and then I know it's

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
cinematic mode and then I know it's
something<00:02:55.139> else<00:02:55.439> that<00:02:55.769> could<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.060> quite

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
something else that could be quite

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.659 
something else that could be quite
interesting<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.930> there's<00:02:58.560> allies<00:02:59.099> on<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.459> map

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
interesting is there's allies on the map

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.720 
interesting is there's allies on the map
and<00:03:00.019> there's<00:03:01.019> also<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:01.799> little<00:03:02.040> button<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and there's also this little button in

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.690 
and there's also this little button in
the<00:03:02.969> top<00:03:03.239> corner<00:03:03.439> that<00:03:04.439> shows<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.310> speech

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the top corner that shows a speech

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
the top corner that shows a speech
bubble<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.540> made<00:03:06.780> me<00:03:06.989> think<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.709> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
bubble and it made me think that is this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.849 
bubble and it made me think that is this
a<00:03:07.980> screenshot<00:03:08.489> from<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.419> multiplayer<00:03:10.319> battle<00:03:10.709> I

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
a screenshot from a multiplayer battle I

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.709 
a screenshot from a multiplayer battle I
don't<00:03:11.189> know<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.120> seems<00:03:12.450> pretty

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
don't know but it seems pretty

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.349 
don't know but it seems pretty
interesting<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:14.400> makes<00:03:14.700> sense<00:03:14.939> that<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
interesting and it makes sense that it

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.640 
interesting and it makes sense that it
would<00:03:15.419> be<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.689> multiplayer<00:03:16.200> battle

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
would be a multiplayer battle

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.409 
would be a multiplayer battle
tell<00:03:16.859> me<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.189> guys<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.209> makes

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
tell me what you guys think and it makes

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.849 
tell me what you guys think and it makes
me<00:03:18.599> think<00:03:18.629> as<00:03:18.930> well<00:03:19.109> if<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.470> settlement

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
me think as well if it's a settlement

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.189 
me think as well if it's a settlement
battle<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.849> could<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.299> multiplayer

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
battle that it could be multiplayer

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.559 
battle that it could be multiplayer
settlement<00:03:22.979> taking<00:03:23.370> or<00:03:23.669> campaign<00:03:24.209> battles

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
settlement taking or campaign battles

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.390 
settlement taking or campaign battles
we'll<00:03:24.840> have<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.169> wait<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.190> one

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
we'll have to wait and see for that one

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.490 
we'll have to wait and see for that one
and<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.269> will<00:03:27.419> see<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> guys<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.379> next

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and I will see you guys in the next

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.619 
and I will see you guys in the next
video<00:03:28.769> remember<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.579> check<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.599> my
