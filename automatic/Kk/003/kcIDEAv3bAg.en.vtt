00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.770
 today I presented you a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.210
 vibrating bluetooth bracelet so we have here 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.429
 so this is the high-end version 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.559
 since the first thing to a very 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.719
 beautiful box that is quite rare 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.619
 and then we have a bracelet to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.689
 easter just here all very metal 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.900
 pretty totally rigid that we will be able 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.990
 come adjust here with 4 points 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 and for sure, my little wrist is going to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.460
 give a nice wristwatch up to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 belmont very pretty all metal bracelet 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.290
 well finished very clean which suddenly goes 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 allow us to be connected so to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.500
 any phone it stays 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.480
 android windows phone blackberry so 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 two buttons down one euro the first 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.860
 so it was lit again we have their 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 who posted permanently 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 here we have a little button to put 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.250
 their backlighting if we stay supported 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:07.729
 on the top button have a power 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 set them to set the minutes 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.860
 and suddenly if you stay down 1 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 and 1 so the power of we do not see very much 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 although their age be worse but I 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.080
 reached for his pair and we stay 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 pressed down as if it was him but 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 is offered rest and supported by the coup 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.610
 goes into pairing mode of a covers a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.390
 little better even though it's not easy to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.590
 write letter that rage 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.759
 so here we will do the test with ios 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.790
 although we could very well do it 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 with android of the coup the pairing is in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.890
 behaving if a pin code 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 as usual these four times 0 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 paired and suddenly hop an after iphone 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 of Sylvain so the name appears there we have 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.979
 a little icon to tell us that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
 is connected alas the battery level 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.219
 so as it's a connected watch 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.540
 So a shadow to this because 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.290
 actually and give their camp but 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.240
 I tend to say a thousand bracelet and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.049
 so when I have a call what is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.399
 going on without 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.009
 the call is still not focused on 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.060
 the Iphone 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.590
 from eating a call 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.140
 automatically on the watch two 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.000
 seconds later the number and the name 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 then what you need to know 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.049
 is that the name appears here because 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.200
 we are on us if we were on android 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.730
 the name would not show up we are 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.379
 on a request that does not allow 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.640
 pick up or reject the call 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.989
 so the two buttons can not 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.400
 used to pick up or redeem at 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.680
 the call we just have an indication on 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.500
 the apple the call so that's it's a 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.810
 shows who does who does his job 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.920
 since add-on time is another 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.720
 who does his job two worlds 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.239
 connected since our alerts by 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.069
 vibrations and by the display of either 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.440
 number if one is on android is 10 name 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 of the caller if we are sure if it is 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.030
 rather pretty sandra we are very fan 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.379
 a good mid-range product 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.760
 high-end for them for 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.620
 bracelets but in the middle of the range for 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.129
 shows them that you can only 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.750
 advisor 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.760
 little problem is that it does not display the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.230
 name on android is the big point 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.599
 positive is that it is compatible with 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.950
 ios android windows phone all 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.730
 phones that has bluetooth 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.730
 here
