00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.160
 Talk to me, welcome to another one. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 budget and today I will show you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 For you, a gamer computer with 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.670
 approximately 2.400 reais is a pc 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 very nice that for me has one of the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580
 best money market with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.320
 this value 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 I particularly liked the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 components that I have chosen because 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.560
 They are expensive components and you can 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.670
 adding little by little then it goes there 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.670
 What I chose for this setup 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 the processor is a mdf 6 and 300 are six 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 32 nanometer photo nuclei 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.780
 default clock of 3.5 GHz but the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 4.1 gigaset are six mega bytes of cache 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.420
 l2 and 8 mega low cache l3 and tdp that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.360
 is the consumption is 95 watts and a socket 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 am3 more on the screen you are seeing the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 program open cpu-z with more 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.700
 processor specifications 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.039
 remembering that it is a very good processor 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.480
 excellent value for money I found a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.430
 average price of three hundred twenty-five 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 is the processor that will not have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 paid with no single video card 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 currently in the market and only problem 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 that I noticed was referring to the rebound that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.250
 comes that it is very weak and makes a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.170
 very loud noise and so I decided 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 put in your configuration in cp the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 spoon kurier plus 32 blizzard he is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 an incoming cpu but it will already 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.659
 make a big difference in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.150
 temperature and especially the noise 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.549
 with cooler box over the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.040
 features it with two chips 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.229
 this dog is 9 cm river 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 maximum is 30 decibels 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 the average price I found it was 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 57 reais and now we will see the motherboard 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.380
 motherboard is selected for this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.040
 configuration is the Gigabyte 970 model 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.020
 the dtp socket am3 plus connection of 8 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 power pins for the CPU power . 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 the processors of eight 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 amd 970 chipset 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.850
 supports memory up to 1866mhz ddr3 with 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 the maximum 32 gigas are six sata ports and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.920
 already has USB 3.0 connector on the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 front panel that comes in the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 on the back it has eight sb 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.080
 2.0 and two more sbt 3.0 beyond the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.120
 audio and network standard inputs 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.930
 this motherboard already supports crossfire 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 however the crossfire where a pci express 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.330
 x16 and another is x 2 so it will not have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.209
 a very good scaling of the plates 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.459
 close to the cushion of this motherboard was 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.440
 343 reais and now let's talk about the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.990
 RAM memory to be chosen 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 I chose to put 8GB of memory 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 clocked at 1333 MHz and I think 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.540
 You curse me saying I could put a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.260
 computer memory that this 1,333 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.000
 channels could have placed 1600 or even 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 1876 ​​the guys before you talk 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.070
 I took a look at this video as 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.739
 put that is done by stec which is a 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.020
 Greek channel that most have access to and speaks 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.090
 about hardware then take a look 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.100
 in this video just click on this link and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.860
 video is going each hubby 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.650
 memory went for an average price of $ 118 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.760
 so we put there twice that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.320
 price and add our calculator galera 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.769
 In this configuration I chose to put the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.510
 128gb ssd from kingston is another tip 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.090
 that I'm going to guys the price of 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.820
 diesel s-10 down there on the internet 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.400
 you will find these ssd of 128 gb 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.920
 for a price of approximately 292 and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 shopping malls and it is well worth buying 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.760
 because because ssd 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 it is a storage that is not 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.239
 mechanic is solid this will give you a 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.340
 tremendous gain at the time you went 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.739
 start the operating system and also 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.930
 your games loadings and 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.180
 hardware says who one day has 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.799
 ssd is never able to use a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.720
 computer without ssd 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.239
 the average price of this model that I found 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.739
 was 275 reais and now let's talk 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.079
 about the chosen hd 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.970
 now chosen for already having a ssd eu 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.600
 I put a following 500 gigabytes 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.810
 with rotation of 7200rpm it already only for 3 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.120
 and the average price I found was 180 reais 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.190
 but now let's go to the office in the office 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680
 which is another component that I also 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.239
 I own the cougar, I think it's a 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.850
 the best value for money out of the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.980
 market but the best was a notice and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.410
 has a very good finish 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.990
 are two more external by our dvds and 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.110
 six internal bays being three for 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.940
 thank you and three for you from the dashboard 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.340
 front features usb 3.0 usb 2.0 and 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.410
 microphone and explain is a cabinet that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.210
 provided the excellent assembly as 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.220
 You are seeing in the picture our 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.560
 assembly will be very good to give 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.260
 hide cables perfectly hd 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.540
 the lid is put in the form of a drawer 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.580
 side of the back has a 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.620
 very good for hiding the cables 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.020
 the weakness of this office is for him 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.690
 not have entrance to receive in the part of 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.030
 this prevents the installation of a 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.770
 I landed with two radiators but 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.389
 as our configuration will not have the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.669
 landfill read will not do the math 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.950
 difference to this configuration one of the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.050
 The strengths of this office are 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.270
 cleaning and maintenance gives to withdraw 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.520
 all available dust filters 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 in him he practically dismounts almost 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.370
 all 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.200
 One tip I give the crowd is to remove 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.190
 the hard drives of drawers that were not 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.380
 used 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.720
 this will improve the ventilation of the two 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.620
 clubs you will be able to install 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.090
 in this cabinet 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 the average price found by this 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.380
 was 170 reais could be that the 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.720
 people have a hard time finding 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.729
 availability of that office out there 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.430
 I will indicate two more the first two 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.380
 pc and divine which is a bit more expensive 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.180
 about 30 reais more expensive than this 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.090
 cabinet, but it's even better that 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.770
 cabinet and the other is the evil neptune case 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.320
 which comes basically the same 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.750
 characteristics of the cougar, however, 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.830
 quality is slightly lower than the 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.270
 video chosen for your setup 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.400
 to the model of the xfx r 7 275 a 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.410
 very good video that I was surprised with 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.690
 the results that were tested 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:11.220
 It is in performance between the HD models 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:14.039
 78 50 and hd 78 70 stayed a little below 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.110
 of 78 70 actually but for the price it is 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.090
 a plate that is worth as much as 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.490
 to characteristics it has standard clock 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.910
 of 900 mhz 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.430
 925 bush is 1500 sad same 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.669
 quantity of r 9 270 2 gb of memory 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.240
 gddr5 running clocked at 5.6 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.970
 garrett and have 256 bit bp pass that the 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.680
 power consumption is 150 watts price 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.720
 found by this model was 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.180
 six years and eight reais and now I'm going to talk 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.310
 about the source chosen by returning 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.580
 my videos budget chosen 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.650
 source with certain 500 watts one of the 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.479
 more recommended bridges for the galera than 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.819
 question what source to use 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:56.210
 she has a great value for money 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.949
 seal 80 pounds of bronze deficit active 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.599
 cables are quite long and will not 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.909
 assembly problem 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.490
 one of the strengths of this source besides 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.440
 efficiency is its noise level is a 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.380
 source that almost makes no noise people 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.449
 I have a 6 x 4 and 30 watt and I do not 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.880
 I regret not buying a little bit 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.639
 she the average price I found this model was 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.130
 of 223 reais and with that we closed 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:22.220
 our budget with the average price of 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.780
 2,400 and seven reais and before finishing 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.449
 With video I'll show you a 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.310
 table with an average of four frames 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.960
 games that are currently played a lot 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.520
 remembering that I got these numbers 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.289
 more sources you see in the 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.090
 and you have to observe the 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.680
 settings used 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.449
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.520
 have enjoyed it if you liked leave it 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.320
 and add favorites if you 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.940
 you not enrolled in the channel sign up 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.530
 to continue receiving videos 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.270
 like this for anyone who wants to take a 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.969
 doubt me just get in touch 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.430
 with me via skype in fanpage 

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:56.800
 twitter or e mail then that's it guys 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.800
 A hug, I'll say goodbye to you and I went
