00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the opposite direction of the hair and

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.580 
the opposite direction of the hair and
that<00:02:01.890> way<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.460> even<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.119> volume

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because it is lightweight it does freeze

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.089 
because it is lightweight it does freeze
instantly<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.769> voluminous<00:02:10.769> look
