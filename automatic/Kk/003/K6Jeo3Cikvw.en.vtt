00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is something really crazy and I

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.580 
is something really crazy and I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
definitely think a lot of people will

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.560 
definitely think a lot of people will
agree<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.980> me<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.460> also<00:00:20.789> believe<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.390> lot

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
agree with me I also believe that a lot

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 
agree with me I also believe that a lot
of<00:00:21.600> people<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:22.050> disagree<00:00:22.260> Mike<00:00:23.070> here's<00:00:23.310> my

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
of people will disagree Mike here's my

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
of people will disagree Mike here's my
little<00:00:23.699> theory<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.560> world

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
little theory so here we have the world

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
little theory so here we have the world
map<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.460> its<00:00:26.699> flat<00:00:27.000> out<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.420> no<00:00:28.849> spiritual<00:00:29.849> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
map in its flat out it's no spiritual so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
map in its flat out it's no spiritual so
keep<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> mind<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.949> guys<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> way<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
keep that in mind so guys all the way to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
keep that in mind so guys all the way to
the<00:00:32.850> left<00:00:32.880> beside<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> middle<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.710> have

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the left beside in the middle we have

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.190 
the left beside in the middle we have
Nevada<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> middle<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.170> little

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
Nevada in the like the middle a little

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
Nevada in the like the middle a little
bit<00:00:37.590> higher<00:00:38.040> than<00:00:38.070> middle<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.210> guess<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.629> could

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
bit higher than middle I guess you could

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.670 
bit higher than middle I guess you could
say<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.670> France<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.329> Paris<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
say we have France or Paris in there and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
say we have France or Paris in there and
all<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> way<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> other<00:00:44.940> side<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.480> have

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
all the way to the other side we have

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.560 
all the way to the other side we have
China<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> guys<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:48.120> into

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
China now if you guys actually look into

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
much I was looking on transit and I was

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
much I was looking on transit and I was
trying<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> find<00:00:59.550> three<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> same<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.350> when

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
trying to find three of the same so when
diner<00:01:01.770> eyes<00:01:01.980> came<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.760> came<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> it

find another place and it's going to
form<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> triangle<00:01:13.970> then<00:01:14.970> after<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> found<00:01:15.900> out

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
form a triangle then after I found out

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
form a triangle then after I found out
the<00:01:16.229> Buried<00:01:16.680> code<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> someone<00:01:17.430> posted<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the Buried code and someone posted the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
the Buried code and someone posted the
Paris<00:01:18.420> catacombs<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.500> watched<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
landmark right near the catacombs and it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
landmark right near the catacombs and it
actually<00:01:29.640> goes<00:01:30.000> underneath<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> catacombs

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
actually goes underneath the catacombs

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.499 
actually goes underneath the catacombs
which<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.189> cool<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.420> you

like call easter egg right there now
somewhere<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> map<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> little

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
somewhere on the map there that little
