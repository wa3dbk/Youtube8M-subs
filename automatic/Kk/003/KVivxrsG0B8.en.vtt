range of batteries so I'm interested to
see<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.470> this<00:00:46.530> performs<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.519> you<00:00:48.150> can<00:00:48.299> pick

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
see how this performs now you can pick

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.979 
see how this performs now you can pick
this<00:00:48.570> battery<00:00:49.080> up<00:00:49.229> for<00:00:50.040> around<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:51.119> nine<00:00:51.570> ten

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
this battery up for around the nine ten

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.469 
this battery up for around the nine ten
dollar<00:00:52.229> mark<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.580> UK<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.210> probably

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
dollar mark and the UK it's probably

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.020 
dollar mark and the UK it's probably
about<00:00:54.600> eight<00:00:54.930> pounds<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.769> it's<00:00:55.979> a<00:00:56.100> very

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
about eight pounds so it's a very

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
about eight pounds so it's a very
reasonable<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.750> spare<00:00:57.960> battery<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.589> I'll

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
reasonable for a spare battery and I'll

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.020 
reasonable for a spare battery and I'll
just<00:00:58.860> take<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.159> through<00:00:59.339> some<00:00:59.519> of<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.670> points

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just take you through some of the points

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.280 
just take you through some of the points
as<00:01:00.150> well<00:01:00.830> around<00:01:01.830> around<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> battery<00:01:02.760> itself

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
as well around around the battery itself

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
as well around around the battery itself
so<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> quick<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> actual

battery and and you know I think the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
battery and and you know I think the
only<00:01:38.640> points<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> make<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.050> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
only points to make out really here is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.720 
only points to make out really here is
that<00:01:40.440> they<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.340> grade<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> cell<00:01:42.450> battery<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
that they are grade a cell battery so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.399 
that they are grade a cell battery so
you<00:01:44.730> saw<00:01:45.180> God<00:01:45.330> guarantee<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.080> battery

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you saw God guarantee that the battery

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
you saw God guarantee that the battery
is<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.790> good<00:01:48.300> battery<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.960> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is going to be a good battery and it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.990 
is going to be a good battery and it's
going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> give<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:50.100> tool<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.760> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
going to give you great tool time I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660 
going to give you great tool time I
think<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.650> looking<00:01:52.950> at<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.100> stats<00:01:53.400> you're

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
think from looking at the stats you're

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.480 
think from looking at the stats you're
probably<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.150> get<00:01:54.240> 500<00:01:55.490> recharge

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
probably going to get 500 recharge

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
probably going to get 500 recharge

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
things don't be throwing the battery and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.369 
things don't be throwing the battery and
interface<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.870> it'll<00:02:37.349> still<00:02:38.160> explode

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
interface because it'll still explode

interface because it'll still explode
and<00:02:40.379> that's<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.650> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
and that's about it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.660 
and that's about it
battery<00:02:42.360> itself<00:02:42.830> again<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.040> repeat<00:02:44.160> some<00:02:44.640> of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
battery itself again just repeat some of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670 
battery itself again just repeat some of
the<00:02:44.760> information<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.660> I've<00:02:46.380> already

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the information that I've already

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.460 
the information that I've already
mentioned<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:48.120> Walt<00:02:48.299> voltage<00:02:49.079> as<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.349> can

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
mentioned the Walt voltage as you can

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.490 
mentioned the Walt voltage as you can
see<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.829> three<00:02:50.130> point<00:02:50.430> eight<00:02:50.549> volts

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
see it's three point eight volts

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.430 
see it's three point eight volts
capacity<00:02:52.500> 22<00:02:52.950> milliamps<00:02:53.870> that's<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.319> we

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
capacity 22 milliamps that's just if we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:06.140 
capacity 22 milliamps that's just if we
can<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.769> into<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.190> quickly<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.349> so<00:03:04.940> I've<00:03:05.940> got

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
can get into this quickly so so I've got

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.690 
can get into this quickly so so I've got
a<00:03:06.180> standard<00:03:06.630> Samsung<00:03:07.349> battery<00:03:07.890> here

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
a standard Samsung battery here

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.910 
a standard Samsung battery here
obviously<00:03:09.540> dimension<00:03:10.349> wise<00:03:10.500> they're<00:03:10.799> gonna

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
obviously dimension wise they're gonna

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.620 
obviously dimension wise they're gonna
be<00:03:11.099> they're<00:03:11.549> gonna<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.880> same<00:03:12.060> wise<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
be they're gonna be the same wise it

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.789 
be they're gonna be the same wise it
wouldn't<00:03:12.900> fit<00:03:13.340> wait<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:15.319> don't<00:03:16.319> think<00:03:16.530> there's

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
wouldn't fit wait I don't think there's

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.620 
wouldn't fit wait I don't think there's
much<00:03:16.950> difference<00:03:17.190> really<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:18.060> expecting

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
much difference really I was expecting

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
much difference really I was expecting
to<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:19.170> little<00:03:19.500> bit<00:03:19.650> lighter<00:03:19.920> and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to be a little little bit lighter and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
to be a little little bit lighter and
one<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.359> points<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.630> know<00:03:21.840> about<00:03:22.019> its

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
one of the points to know about its

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.150 
one of the points to know about its
battery<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.639> there<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.880> no<00:03:24.120> NFC<00:03:25.100> or<00:03:26.100> near

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
battery is that there is no NFC or near

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.440 
battery is that there is no NFC or near
field<00:03:26.989> communication<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.250> battery<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.090> if

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
field communication on the battery so if

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.259 
field communication on the battery so if
you're<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.290> user<00:03:31.980> probably<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> States<00:03:32.850> and

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you're a user probably in the States and

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.420 
you're a user probably in the States and
you're<00:03:33.569> looking<00:03:33.840> at<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.260> battery<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.040> can

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
you're looking at a battery that you can

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.750 
you're looking at a battery that you can
use<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:36.540> payments<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:37.530> you're<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:38.609> gonna

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
use for payments then you're not gonna

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.240 
use for payments then you're not gonna
have<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.060> use<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.720> battery<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:40.889> again

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
have to use this this battery but again

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.849 
have to use this this battery but again
as<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.639> spare<00:03:41.970> battery<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.590> only<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.680> few

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
as a spare battery for only a few

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.150 
as a spare battery for only a few
dollars<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:45.290> understand<00:03:46.290> why<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:46.799> been<00:03:46.950> left

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
dollars I understand why it's been left

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.400 
dollars I understand why it's been left
out<00:03:47.370> now<00:03:48.180> what<00:03:48.389> I'm<00:03:48.450> gonna<00:03:48.569> do<00:03:48.840> I'm<00:03:49.170> gonna<00:03:49.290> put

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
out now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.710 
out now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put
this<00:03:49.739> for<00:03:49.980> its<00:03:50.100> paces<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.910> I'm<00:03:51.329> gonna<00:03:51.420> start

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
this for its paces and I'm gonna start

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.599 
this for its paces and I'm gonna start
using<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.109> battery<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> few<00:03:52.920> days<00:03:53.099> and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
using this battery for a few days and

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.400 
using this battery for a few days and
I'll<00:03:53.970> report<00:03:54.269> back<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.930> sort<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.230> life

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
I'll report back on the sort of life

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.460 
I'll report back on the sort of life
that<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:57.180> probably<00:03:57.480> expect<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.930> get<00:03:58.079> from<00:03:58.349> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
that you probably expect to get from the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.430 
that you probably expect to get from the
battery<00:03:59.150> I'm<00:04:00.150> guessing<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.139> we're<00:04:01.319> probably

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
battery I'm guessing that we're probably

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.580 
battery I'm guessing that we're probably
gonna<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.889> similar<00:04:02.190> performance<00:04:03.590> I'll

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
gonna get a similar performance I'll

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.289 
gonna get a similar performance I'll
expect<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.160> get<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.370> similar<00:04:05.700> form<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
expect to get a similar form to the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.680 
expect to get a similar form to the
battery<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.840> already<00:04:07.290> comes<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.430> s3

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
battery that already comes with the s3

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.319 
battery that already comes with the s3
so<00:04:09.690> I'll<00:04:09.989> pause<00:04:10.169> this<00:04:10.290> video<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.090> I'll<00:04:12.090> see

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
so I'll pause this video and I'll see

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.449 
so I'll pause this video and I'll see
you<00:04:12.389> in<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> few<00:04:12.720> days<00:04:12.750> okay<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:13.889> it's<00:04:14.280> been<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
you in a few days okay so it's been a

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.969 
you in a few days okay so it's been a
few<00:04:14.700> days<00:04:14.849> now<00:04:14.910> since<00:04:15.209> I've<00:04:15.690> been<00:04:16.470> using<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
few days now since I've been using the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.610 
few days now since I've been using the
anchor<00:04:17.370> spare<00:04:18.299> battery<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.940> after<00:04:20.940> say

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
anchor spare battery and after say

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.870 
anchor spare battery and after say
absolutely<00:04:22.620> no

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
absolutely no

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.500 
absolutely no
problems<00:04:23.180> whatsoever<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.260> battery<00:04:24.650> and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
problems whatsoever with the battery and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.780 
problems whatsoever with the battery and
I've<00:04:26.510> been<00:04:27.020> using<00:04:27.200> this<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:27.800> probably<00:04:28.640> about

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
I've been using this for probably about

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.210 
I've been using this for probably about
four<00:04:29.120> or<00:04:29.180> five<00:04:29.390> days<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.990> I've<00:04:30.980> been<00:04:31.010> getting

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
four or five days and I've been getting

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.750 
four or five days and I've been getting
varying<00:04:31.760> levels<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.840> performance<00:04:33.590> really<00:04:34.220> in

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
varying levels of performance really in

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.710 
varying levels of performance really in
the<00:04:35.300> main<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.900> performs<00:04:36.800> just<00:04:36.980> as<00:04:37.340> well<00:04:37.400> as<00:04:37.760> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
the main it performs just as well as the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.420 
the main it performs just as well as the
standard<00:04:39.140> battery<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.650> get<00:04:39.890> in<00:04:40.100> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
standard battery that you get in the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.150 
standard battery that you get in the
galaxy<00:04:40.820> s3<00:04:41.240> I've<00:04:41.930> had<00:04:42.140> days<00:04:42.380> where<00:04:42.410> is

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
galaxy s3 I've had days where is

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.670 
galaxy s3 I've had days where is
actually<00:04:43.610> performed<00:04:44.000> better<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.530> can

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
actually performed better and I can

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.440 
actually performed better and I can
always<00:04:45.800> tell<00:04:46.160> because<00:04:46.400> my<00:04:46.640> usage<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.210> pretty

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
always tell because my usage is pretty

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.230 
always tell because my usage is pretty
much<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.230> same<00:04:48.470> every<00:04:48.920> day<00:04:48.950> do<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.910> little<00:04:50.150> bit

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
much the same every day do a little bit

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.720 
much the same every day do a little bit
of<00:04:50.300> web<00:04:50.450> browsing<00:04:50.720> check<00:04:51.410> my<00:04:51.530> emails<00:04:51.890> Facebook

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
of web browsing check my emails Facebook

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.540 
of web browsing check my emails Facebook
Twitter<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.350> probably<00:04:55.100> watch<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> couple<00:04:55.400> of

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
Twitter and probably watch a couple of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.170 
Twitter and probably watch a couple of
YouTube<00:04:55.610> videos<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:57.730> fairly<00:04:58.730> standard

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
YouTube videos so fairly standard

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.880 
YouTube videos so fairly standard
everyday<00:04:59.450> so<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.870> get<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.080> good<00:05:00.230> idea<00:05:00.350> and

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
everyday so I get a good idea and

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.180 
everyday so I get a good idea and
normally<00:05:02.020> my<00:05:03.020> battery<00:05:03.530> life<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.610> get<00:05:04.940> about

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
normally my battery life I get about

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.310 
normally my battery life I get about
towards<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.340> evening<00:05:07.430> between<00:05:07.880> 35<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.690> 40

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
towards the evening between 35 and 40

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.820 
towards the evening between 35 and 40
percent

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
percent

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.380 
percent
you<00:05:10.040> see<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:10.430> nearly<00:05:10.610> 7<00:05:10.880> o'clock<00:05:11.090> at<00:05:11.210> night

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
you see it's nearly 7 o'clock at night

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.560 
you see it's nearly 7 o'clock at night
so<00:05:11.690> about<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> 35<00:05:12.980> 40<00:05:13.370> %<00:05:13.700> so<00:05:13.910> it's<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.060> good<00:05:14.180> marker

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
so about a 35 40 % so it's a good marker

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.350 
so about a 35 40 % so it's a good marker
for<00:05:14.600> me<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.080> know<00:05:15.710> that's<00:05:16.580> based<00:05:17.120> on<00:05:17.300> my

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
for me and I know that's based on my

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.320 
for me and I know that's based on my
usage<00:05:17.870> now<00:05:18.110> some<00:05:18.710> days<00:05:18.920> it's<00:05:19.670> been<00:05:20.030> it's

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
usage now some days it's been it's

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.320 
usage now some days it's been it's
actually<00:05:20.660> performed<00:05:21.050> better<00:05:21.760> some<00:05:22.760> days<00:05:22.790> have

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
actually performed better some days have

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.880 
actually performed better some days have
a<00:05:23.360> longer<00:05:24.020> life<00:05:24.200> out<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.470> it

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
a longer life out of it

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.060 
a longer life out of it
over<00:05:25.370> days<00:05:25.550> it's<00:05:26.480> not<00:05:26.870> been<00:05:27.110> so<00:05:27.320> good<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:27.950> I'm

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
over days it's not been so good and I'm

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.820 
over days it's not been so good and I'm
saw<00:05:28.250> hitting<00:05:28.580> 30<00:05:28.880> percent<00:05:29.390> 25<00:05:29.990> percent<00:05:30.230> so

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
saw hitting 30 percent 25 percent so

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.310 
saw hitting 30 percent 25 percent so
it's<00:05:31.430> very<00:05:31.550> difficult<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.210> George<00:05:32.750> bought<00:05:33.140> I

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
it's very difficult to George bought I

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.450 
it's very difficult to George bought I
would<00:05:33.470> say<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.830> main<00:05:33.950> it's<00:05:34.130> gonna<00:05:34.220> last

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
would say in the main it's gonna last

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.720 
would say in the main it's gonna last
you<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.670> day<00:05:34.880> clearly<00:05:35.480> and<00:05:35.980> and<00:05:36.980> you're

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
you a day clearly and and you're

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.650 
you a day clearly and and you're
probably<00:05:37.880> going<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.240> get<00:05:38.390> similar

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
probably going to get similar

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
probably going to get similar
performance<00:05:39.320> as<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.770> would<00:05:40.040> do<00:05:40.280> with<00:05:40.970> your

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
performance as you would do with your

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.950 
performance as you would do with your
standard<00:05:42.680> battery<00:05:43.130> so<00:05:43.850> that's<00:05:44.570> pretty<00:05:44.780> much

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
standard battery so that's pretty much

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.600 
standard battery so that's pretty much
all<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:45.260> gonna<00:05:45.380> say<00:05:45.620> on<00:05:45.650> matter<00:05:45.920> really<00:05:46.160> it's

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
all I'm gonna say on matter really it's

you know if you're looking for a spare

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.150 
you know if you're looking for a spare
battery<00:05:48.680> it's<00:05:49.610> cheap<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.450> know<00:05:50.840> eight<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.890> ten

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
battery it's cheap you know eight to ten

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.330 
battery it's cheap you know eight to ten
dollars<00:05:52.550> it's<00:05:52.960> in<00:05:53.960> my<00:05:54.110> view<00:05:54.350> is<00:05:54.590> very<00:05:54.890> cheap

dollars it's in my view is very cheap

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.430 
dollars it's in my view is very cheap
for<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.580> spare<00:05:55.820> battery<00:05:55.970> and<00:05:56.480> if<00:05:57.140> you're<00:05:57.290> not

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440
