liquid than it would if it's fresh that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.550 
liquid than it would if it's fresh that
in<00:00:19.199> there<00:00:19.350> we're<00:00:19.560> also<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> need<00:00:20.220> some

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
in there we're also going to need some

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.240 
in there we're also going to need some
latex<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:23.240> vinyl<00:00:24.240> gloves<00:00:24.630> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> use

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
latex or vinyl gloves we're going to use

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.060 
latex or vinyl gloves we're going to use
quite<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> bit<00:00:27.119> less<00:00:27.510> cure<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.680> guanciale

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
quite a bit less cure on the guanciale

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
quite a bit less cure on the guanciale
than<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.460> would<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.570> something<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.170> bacon

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
than we would on something like bacon

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
than we would on something like bacon
because<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.520> bacon<00:00:32.730> cure<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.540> half

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
because the bacon cure is about half

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.770 
because the bacon cure is about half
sugar<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.739> about<00:00:34.860> half<00:00:35.219> salt<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.329> mostly

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sugar and about half salt this is mostly

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
sugar and about half salt this is mostly
salt<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.260> pretty<00:00:37.469> much<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.829> salt<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.250> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
salt it's pretty much all salt with just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.619 
salt it's pretty much all salt with just
a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> flavorings<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a little bit of flavorings in it so

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.670 
a little bit of flavorings in it so
we're<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.469> bit<00:00:40.559> more

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we're going to be a little bit more

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
we're going to be a little bit more
delicate<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.219> sprinkling<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.030> there

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
delicate about sprinkling it on there

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.500 
delicate about sprinkling it on there
we're<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.309> get<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.579> nice<00:00:45.270> even

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
coating all right so I'm just going to
sort<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> smooth<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.980> now

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
sort of smooth that in a little bit now

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
sort of smooth that in a little bit now
that<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> nice<00:00:50.760> even<00:00:51.030> coat<00:00:51.420> smooth<00:00:52.170> it

over<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> edge<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:55.260> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.530> give

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
over the edge and then just kind of give

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
over the edge and then just kind of give
it<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.829> shake<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> excess<00:00:56.969> off

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it a little shake to get the excess off

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.080 
it a little shake to get the excess off
of<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.800> end<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.250> over

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of there that way we don't end up over

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
of there that way we don't end up over
curing<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> same

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
curing it we're going to do the same

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
curing it we're going to do the same
thing<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.820> there's<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thing to the back side there's there's a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
thing to the back side there's there's a
reason<00:01:06.510> why<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.740> Fancy<00:01:08.250> Pants

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
reason why you see you know Fancy Pants

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
reason why you see you know Fancy Pants
food<00:01:09.360> service<00:01:09.810> guys<00:01:10.049> chefs<00:01:10.650> cooks<00:01:11.100> whatever

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
food service guys chefs cooks whatever

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
food service guys chefs cooks whatever
doing<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.360> whole<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
doing this whole thing is because it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
doing this whole thing is because it's
falling<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> higher<00:01:14.670> altitude<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
falling from a higher altitude so it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.840 
falling from a higher altitude so it
spreads<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.700> which

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
spreads out a little bit more which

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
spreads out a little bit more which
makes<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> come<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.710> evenly<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.369> it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
makes it come down more evenly so it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.440 
makes it come down more evenly so it's
it's<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.909> look<00:01:23.909> cool<00:01:24.210> it's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's not just to you know look cool it's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's not just to you know look cool it's
actually<00:01:24.799> has<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> has<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> purpose

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
actually has a has a purpose

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.399 
actually has a has a purpose
all<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> give<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
all right we're going to give that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
all right we're going to give that
another<00:01:28.680> shake<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> sort
