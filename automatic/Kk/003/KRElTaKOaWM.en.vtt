00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:11.160
 good morning today we will prepare myself is not 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.690
 yellow to the natural marble in time yes 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
 it proceeds like this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 two lemons are needed in this case of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 Amalgamate the juice naturally in the skins 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 and seeds the corresponding amount of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.320
 men's water juice and 250 g of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.780
 half a kilo of melon sugar 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 yellow we cut it tricks like in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 this case to do it naturally 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 we take our cans we send you back 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.100
 melon sechi 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.540
 in this case I cut them to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.729
 little pieces you don't want can be cut 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.729
 also sliced 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:33.170
 in this way then cut into small pieces 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:35.509
 lemon and are suitable for a cell 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 the corresponding water then we say 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.210
 a cup of water in the juice square 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.210
 of lemon dissolved sugar well 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:54.009
 and so we got a syrup 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:59.000
 thick enough to cover 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:06.550
 completely the pieces of milone as 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.550
 in this case, as always, we know very well 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.819
 and my name is in our peninsula 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.799
 as you see in this case warm water 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:32.190
 let's slide the corners of the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:34.530
 canvas between the jars we put a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.739
 piece of coarse salt to favor 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.290
 boiling and sterilization e 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.510
 put on the wolf must boil for 30 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 minutes for a being initiation 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.989
 perfect 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 meanwhile or cooked the rest we say 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 200 grams of melon coat with 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:08.879
 a portion of the syrup in this 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.739
 case there were about 150 in syrup of 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:18.510
 water and lemon and sugar made so 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.269
 that is accepted now is not yet 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.489
 hot we throw in the sick 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:29.419
 bartering set up kept warm in 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:35.549
 warm water to avoid jolts of 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:37.910
 temperature now we send you an in 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.910
 turin 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:58.060
 as usual we beat a little because 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:04.959
 come luxury afloat any to 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.959
 five air that has remained from the prices 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:27.910
 here you see we clean well around like al 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:30.919
 usual and after between plan 11 with which 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.560
 we turn the jar upside down for 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.160
 at least a quarter of an hour later, if so 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.430
 we can turn it over again in this 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.910
 so we got a jam of 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.030
 marathon yellow melon a little e 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.800
 two jars of melon bits 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.870
