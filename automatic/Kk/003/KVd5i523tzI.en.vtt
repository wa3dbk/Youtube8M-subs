00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
Sally's or your local beauty supply

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
store should have it so it should look

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950

like that what I love the most about

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.790 
like that what I love the most about
this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.430> comes<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.629> jar<00:00:46.050> because

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
this is that it comes in a jar because

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
this is that it comes in a jar because
why<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> isn't<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> jar

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
why do do I like it that isn't a jar

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500 
why do do I like it that isn't a jar
because<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.129> stir<00:00:50.340> izing<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> then

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
because when I'm one stir izing and then

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.389 
because when I'm one stir izing and then
sealing<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:53.750> easier<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.079> maneuver<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.219> go

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
sealing it's easier to maneuver and go

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.950 
sealing it's easier to maneuver and go
back<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> forth<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.210> hair<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.660> jar

back and forth for my hair to the jar

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
back and forth for my hair to the jar
versus<00:00:58.379> being<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.829> bottle<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
versus being in a bottle where you have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.479 
versus being in a bottle where you have
a<00:00:59.550> shake<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.100> hands

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.670 
and this is what it looks like it's
white<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> inside<00:01:15.080> it's<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.200> very

lightweight<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.820> well<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.450> not<00:01:18.600> heavy<00:01:18.990> when

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
lightweight as well it's not heavy when

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
lightweight as well it's not heavy when
it<00:01:19.439> goes<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.799> hair<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> really

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that since it is lightweight I can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
that since it is lightweight I can
moisturize<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.350> seal<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.040> ends<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.579> my

I'm just putting it on the ends because

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.159 
I'm just putting it on the ends because

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
eventually get up here as well so it

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.830 
eventually get up here as well so it
does<00:04:42.080> not<00:04:42.590> weigh<00:04:42.950> my<00:04:43.190> hair<00:04:43.220> down<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:44.300> I'm<00:04:44.419> gonna

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
does not weigh my hair down so I'm gonna

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.020 
does not weigh my hair down so I'm gonna
keep<00:04:45.050> saying<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:46.280> like<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> miracle

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
keep saying that but it's like a miracle

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.030 
keep saying that but it's like a miracle
so<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.990> what<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.260> looks<00:04:48.470> like<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:48.890> a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
so this is what it looks like it's a

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.840 
so this is what it looks like it's a
white<00:04:49.250> product<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:52.070> can't<00:04:52.400> think<00:04:52.730> of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
white product so I can't think of

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.610 
white product so I can't think of
anything<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.630> dislike<00:04:54.169> about<00:04:54.200> this

that I wish the jar was bigger because

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.500 
that I wish the jar was bigger because
if<00:05:00.229> you're<00:05:00.380> using<00:05:00.410> this<00:05:00.919> every<00:05:01.400> day<00:05:01.510> you're

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
gonna eventually run out and I would

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.820 
gonna eventually run out and I would
just<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.780> if<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.110> was<00:05:06.140> in<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.440> larger

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
just like it if it was in a larger

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.620 
just like it if it was in a larger
bottle<00:05:06.979> because<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.370> like<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.970> product<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:08.479> lot

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
bottle because I like this product a lot

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.870 
bottle because I like this product a lot
and<00:05:09.050> if<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.320> wasn't<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.590> larger<00:05:10.010> bought<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.430> jar

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
and if it wasn't a larger bought a jar

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.580 
and if it wasn't a larger bought a jar
it<00:05:11.479> would<00:05:11.630> be<00:05:11.750> just<00:05:11.990> great

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
it would be just great

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.490 
it would be just great
so<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.880> little<00:05:14.479> this<00:05:14.840> product<00:05:15.260> does

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
so but a little this product does

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.920 
so but a little this product does
distribute<00:05:16.340> like<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:16.940> long<00:05:17.330> way<00:05:17.600> so<00:05:17.660> you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
distribute like a long way so you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.450 
distribute like a long way so you
wouldn't<00:05:18.200> have<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.470> use<00:05:18.500> like<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.979> whole<00:05:19.010> whole

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
wouldn't have to use like a whole whole

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.400 
wouldn't have to use like a whole whole
whole<00:05:19.700> bunch<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.210> does<00:05:20.390> definitely<00:05:20.990> go<00:05:21.110> along

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
whole bunch it does definitely go along

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.460 
whole bunch it does definitely go along
so<00:05:21.890> that<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:22.340> pretty<00:05:22.610> much<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:23.120> in<00:05:23.479> my<00:05:23.660> box<00:05:24.140> I

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
so that is pretty much it in my box I

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.770 
so that is pretty much it in my box I
basically<00:05:24.979> kept<00:05:25.340> saying<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.880> like<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.330> product

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780
