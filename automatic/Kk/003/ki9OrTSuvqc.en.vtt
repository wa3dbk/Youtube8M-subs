from the local performance part it's a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.710 
from the local performance part it's a
little<00:00:16.139> bit<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:17.359> I<00:00:19.369> feel<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.400> cryptic<00:00:20.850> like

little bit and I feel like cryptic like

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.900 
little bit and I feel like cryptic like
warning<00:00:22.170> drip<00:00:22.650> tape<00:00:23.240> it's<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:25.550> almost<00:00:26.550> one

warning drip tape it's like almost one

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.529 
warning drip tape it's like almost one
in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> grip<00:00:27.330> tape<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.849> should<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.510> good

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
in the grip tape so we should be good

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.410 
in the grip tape so we should be good
for<00:00:30.929> its<00:00:31.740> ripped<00:00:31.949> tape<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:35.149> I<00:00:36.149> am

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
for its ripped tape that's good and I am

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.260 
for its ripped tape that's good and I am
with<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.989> TD<00:00:37.739> tool<00:00:38.129> well<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.030> even<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
with a TD tool well it's not even a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.770 
with a TD tool well it's not even a
technic<00:00:39.809> tool<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> Technic<00:00:41.610> tool<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
technic tool the Technic tool this is a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
technic tool the Technic tool this is a
tough<00:00:43.079> tech<00:00:43.320> tool<00:00:43.620> huh<00:00:45.530> ok<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> tech

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
tough tech tool huh ok this was a tech

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.260 
tough tech tool huh ok this was a tech
tech<00:00:47.610> tool<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.700> thing's<00:00:50.940> little

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tech tool it has this thing's little

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.380 
tech tool it has this thing's little
wider<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:51.989> bigger<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.850> one's<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
wider it's a lot bigger this one's a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.040 
wider it's a lot bigger this one's a
little<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.780> narrow<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.840> one's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
little more narrow so I think this one's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.729 
little more narrow so I think this one's
more<00:00:58.230> magnetic<00:00:59.000> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> tech<00:01:00.329> tech<00:01:00.539> tool<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
more magnetic in the tech tech tool so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
more magnetic in the tech tech tool so
to<00:01:01.800> better<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.180> trying<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.680> pick

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to better see what you're trying to pick

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.789 
to better see what you're trying to pick
up<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> bolts<00:01:05.330> or<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.810> other<00:01:06.930> bolts<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.590> put

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
up the bolts or the other bolts to put

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.620 
up the bolts or the other bolts to put
in<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> truck<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> wheel<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.560> take

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
in to like truck or the wheel you take

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
in to like truck or the wheel you take
then<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.100> real<00:01:14.100> nice<00:01:14.369> Angela<00:01:16.610> really

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
then put it in real nice Angela really

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.660 
then put it in real nice Angela really
easy<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> tactic<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> once<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
easy so it's not a tactic to once a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.690 
easy so it's not a tactic to once a
little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.299> better<00:01:21.479> oh<00:01:22.460> yeah<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> think

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little bit a lot better oh yeah I think

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.160 
little bit a lot better oh yeah I think

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
high kicks which at first oh my god I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.910 
high kicks which at first oh my god I
was<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.100> was<00:02:07.520> what<00:02:07.759> sucks<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:09.619> I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
was like I was what sucks and then I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.910 
was like I was what sucks and then I
used<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.789> or<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.840> was<00:02:12.049> going<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.260> obviously<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
used it or I was going to obviously is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
used it or I was going to obviously is
it<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.100> body<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:16.030> way<00:02:17.030> better<00:02:17.450> than<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> g<00:02:18.140> 3

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
it a body and way better than the g 3

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.890 
it a body and way better than the g 3
which<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:19.100> which<00:02:19.459> was<00:02:19.790> my<00:02:19.970> preference<00:02:20.540> to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
which is that which was my preference to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.690 
which is that which was my preference to
it<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.180> way<00:02:23.360> better<00:02:23.569> than<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.489> for<00:02:25.489> me

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it so it's way better than that for me

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.839 
it so it's way better than that for me
at<00:02:26.090> least<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:28.190> wide<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.849> 27

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
at least and it's wide that's like 27

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.830 
at least and it's wide that's like 27
Miller's<00:02:32.420> millimeters<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.819> it's<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.030> 2.7

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
Miller's millimeters so it's like 2.7

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.740 
Miller's millimeters so it's like 2.7
meet<00:02:36.019> centimeters<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:39.340> longer<00:02:40.540> g3<00:02:41.540> or

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
why I did that the holes were a little

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.650 
why I did that the holes were a little
off<00:04:39.810> i<00:04:42.470> like-like-like<00:04:43.520> not<00:04:44.520> with<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.270> trucks

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.880 
but it made it harder to put the trucks
on<00:04:48.900> because<00:04:49.710> it's<00:04:49.740> right<00:04:50.190> on<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.520> tip<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:52.470> it's

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
on because it's right on the tip so it's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.520

fat-faced<00:07:14.199> fingerboards<00:07:14.740> in<00:07:14.860> case<00:07:15.039> you're

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
fat-faced fingerboards in case you're

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.129 
fat-faced fingerboards in case you're
wondering<00:07:15.389> motive<00:07:16.389> they're<00:07:16.750> all<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.110> same

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
wondering motive they're all the same

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.100 
wondering motive they're all the same
shape<00:07:17.729> they<00:07:18.729> have<00:07:18.819> different<00:07:19.029> colors<00:07:19.389> to<00:07:19.419> look

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
I think just regular would like maple

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.990 
I think just regular would like maple
colored<00:07:26.970> and<00:07:27.180> that's<00:07:27.510> it<00:07:27.780> and<00:07:28.200> yeah<00:07:28.860> that's<00:07:29.820> it

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000
