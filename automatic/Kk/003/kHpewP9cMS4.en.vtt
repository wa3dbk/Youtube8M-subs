00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you ordered so the next step is just

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.590 
you ordered so the next step is just
pulling<00:00:35.700> off<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> tape<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.540> that

pulling off all the tape and that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
pulling off all the tape and that
actually<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.290> little<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.620> harder<00:00:37.860> than

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
actually can be a little bit harder than

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually can be a little bit harder than
you<00:00:38.100> might<00:00:38.250> expect

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you might expect

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
you might expect
as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.570> Apple<00:00:39.899> does<00:00:40.020> provide<00:00:40.290> an

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
as you can see Apple does provide an

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.780 
as you can see Apple does provide an
orange<00:00:40.680> tab<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.219> designed<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> make<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
easier to pull off all the tape but it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.900 
easier to pull off all the tape but it's
very<00:00:43.649> easy<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.070> tear<00:00:44.309> off<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> tab<00:00:44.760> by
