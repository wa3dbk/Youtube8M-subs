00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:48.800 
pipe going towards the inside of the car
hangers<00:02:39.599> going<00:02:39.780> towards<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> back

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.020 

I<00:02:48.870> won't<00:02:49.830> stall<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> rear<00:02:50.550> hanger

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 

now<00:02:58.780> we're<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.050> rehang<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.680> media<00:02:59.980> pipe

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
now we're to rehang in a media pipe

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.710 
now we're to rehang in a media pipe
let's<00:03:00.700> start<00:03:00.880> by<00:03:00.970> putting<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.300> supplied

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
let's start by putting the supplied

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.550 
let's start by putting the supplied
clamp<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.410> into<00:03:02.650> place<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:05.200> I'll<00:03:05.320> put<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
clamp up into place and I'll put the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:17.620 
clamp up into place and I'll put the
intermediate<00:03:05.980> pipe<00:03:06.160> back<00:03:06.340> on

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.570 

it's<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> lot<00:03:18.780> easier<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.080> put<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> clamp<00:03:19.770> on<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it's a lot easier to put the clamp on to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.640 
it's a lot easier to put the clamp on to
the<00:03:20.670> intermediate<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.450> slide<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:22.500> into

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the intermediate and slide it up into

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.250 
the intermediate and slide it up into
place

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.110 

now<00:03:31.980> we'll<00:03:32.129> line<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> intermediate<00:03:32.879> up<00:03:32.970> with

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
now we'll line the intermediate up with

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.910 
now we'll line the intermediate up with
our<00:03:33.239> new<00:03:33.390> router<00:03:33.659> exhaust

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:51.760 

pay<00:03:39.920> up<00:03:40.010> over<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.520> tighten<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.150> down

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:08.350 

now<00:03:52.770> move<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.400> passenger<00:03:53.820> side

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.120 

and<00:04:08.840> I'll<00:04:08.960> retighten<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.500> clamps<00:04:09.890> from<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and I'll retighten the clamps from the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:22.620 
and I'll retighten the clamps from the
intermediate<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.760> h-pipe

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.570 

we'll<00:04:23.630> install<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.020> clamp<00:04:24.500> onto<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.250> tip

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
we'll install the clamp onto the tip

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.950 
we'll install the clamp onto the tip
first

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.490 

tip<00:04:30.710> onto<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.100> muffler<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:32.630> line<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:33.199> up

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.410 

and<00:04:37.190> then<00:04:37.310> tighten<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.670> down<00:04:43.000> now<00:04:44.000> one<00:04:44.210> stall<00:04:44.390> a

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
and then tighten it down now one stall a

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:54.280 
and then tighten it down now one stall a
passenger<00:04:44.930> side<00:04:45.140> in<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.350> same<00:04:45.530> way

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.940 

put<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.370> up<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.670> then<00:04:55.760> tighten<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.060> down

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
put it up and then tighten it down

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.170 
put it up and then tighten it down
