00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.090
 how about youtube friends i am 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.370
 montjuc stress welcome to one video and 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.140
 for this occasion I bring you finally here 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.900
 the channel achieved the legend of the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.430
 solitary halo 4 and it makes me 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.560
 it took a while to upload this video 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.180
 he managed at least to get it because he 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.150
 has a lot to do I got it 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.700
 on 10th yesterday I was going to upload the video 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 immediately I got it but by 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.100
 the most problems that I had this did not 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.080
 gave time or rather this one did not have 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.010
 I had it here with the resources to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 upload this 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.930
 today I can already record 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 and good now yes already with what is the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.809
 video I do not know if you remember my 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.309
 first videos that I have on the channel 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.320
 they were from the first all the videos 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.290
 of which I am going to speak the first 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 is the one of the three or you saw and achieved the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.970
 achievement of passing the legendary game that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.170
 good times were those really me 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.140
 I remember when I was going through it 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.659
 although it will be very difficult but it is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.240
 enjoying even when finally what 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.159
 I ended up like I was left with a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.259
 glass and you want to keep playing 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.790
 but it did not make sense to go back to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.110
 make the game and much less in difficult 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 so I left it 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.980
 although they were pending of some 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.250
 shooting achievements because you never gather 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.960
 people to get them and still still 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.490
 I start if you have gender 3 or 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.410
 you gave and want to help me with these 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.310
 achievements can only be done by sending a 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.460
 message to my gamertag not only have in 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.110
 the description of the video 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.440
 and good this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.810
 now yes after that I made video of 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.540
 halo reach also when I had it in 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.840
 legendary individual I also had a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 well playing the campaign no no what 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.210
 I enjoyed it as much as 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.579
 like where he froze three or distil but 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.189
 likewise the phase good and good 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.930
 because I tell you all this is because here 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.200
 in the cuatros of the opposite 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.880
 the game is really bad, the game is not 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.369
 I wanted to say that 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.410
 the campaign is really bad at least to me 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.090
 it seemed like this 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.990
 I'm not talking about history or 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.960
 much less because the story I think that 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.170
 it goes quite well according to what it was and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.830
 the three the ideal continuation such as 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.830
 It must have been 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.540
 and the multiplayer that is another one with 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.550
 exam t a pretty good multiplayer 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.640
 of the best multiple there 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.620
 at present 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.170
 not the most competitive but of the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.460
 better I do not say it's the best 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.070
 why 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.230
 to focus on what I think for myself 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.000
 multiplayer call the bad of feel 3 for 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.460
 there's no better multiplayer 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.370
 competitive than that of gears of war 3 that 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.570
 that's where I have my clan but good 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.280
 hello yes that seems pretty 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.280
 entertaining very funny 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.210
 and just that 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.440
 is what I wanted to tell you before 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.890
 before why am I here in this 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.350
 mission and having known that some will be 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.910
 strange result to see me here playing 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.480
 this mission when I'm talking to you 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.700
 from the end of hello 4a legendary good 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.290
 it was because this mission me when I 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.540
 I went through the first time I considered that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.170
 This mission was the worst so I left 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.709
 in the end I passed all of them first 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.930
 and I decided to leave this at the end and already when 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.880
 I was going through it, I realized that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.920
 it was so bad even this part of the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.540
 tank I found it funny because of that it's 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.010
 that I went up to this part especially and not 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.710
 from the beginning but just 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.210
 practically in the tank part 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.790
 that is already almost at the end 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.190
 here I am seeing this ship and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.620
 destroying these these two little ones 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.410
 force fields is already the end of the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.900
 mission later if with this one 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.940
 cinematographic history 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.070
 now they will see it which by the way 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.170
 I'm going to put it in fast camera because 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.360
 So as not to waste time 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.190
 I do not want to delay with this video 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.190
 since I'm not going to show you how to get 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.680
 the achievement, let alone a single one that 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.989
 I can tell you is that I recommend you more 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.430
 well is that they always carry when they have 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.650
 the opportunity carry a gun 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.480
 plasma you know where you expect plasma 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 a few more shots to the head in 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.280
 times one depends on the enemy that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.100
 it will be much easier for them when 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.350
 you can so I simply spend it on 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.060
 ammunition do not waste it on everything 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.790
 I'm not saying do not shoot the whole mission 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.070
 not much less but you can see the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.050
 ammunition go slowly do not want to go 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.620
 quickly this does not get like this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.620
 slowly 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.180
 and what else but I think I do not have anything 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.699
 what to say I continue with the moment in 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.539
 jumping achievement we see ourselves in another 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.720
 video goodbye if you do not do it took place and 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.720
 I 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.760
 who resigns 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.760
 that way 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.960
 no sir 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.110
 with enough stress man captain 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.090
 single captain the earth there will be 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.810
 problems cut there I will do what 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.810
 we can here
