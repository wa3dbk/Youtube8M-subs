00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.349 
and I have noticed it in the past couple
episodes<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:20.329> he<00:03:20.930> BK<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.370> really<00:03:22.910> noticed

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
episodes of he BK but I really noticed

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.670 
episodes of he BK but I really noticed
it<00:03:23.480> when<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.630> sat<00:03:23.900> down<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.260> watched<00:03:24.470> this

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
it when I sat down and watched this

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.500 
it when I sat down and watched this
episode<00:03:25.069> like<00:03:25.220> out<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.030> episodes<00:03:26.269> I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
episode like out of all the episodes I

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.680 
episode like out of all the episodes I
think<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.200> far<00:03:27.500> from<00:03:27.950> he<00:03:28.790> became<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.480> was

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
think so far from he became this was

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.180 
think so far from he became this was
probably<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> best<00:03:30.170> production<00:03:30.709> value

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
probably the best production value

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.770 
probably the best production value
according<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:31.849> him<00:03:32.209> when<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.420> comes<00:03:32.569> to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
according to him when it comes to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.289 
according to him when it comes to
animation<00:03:33.709> quality<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.340> art<00:03:34.489> style<00:03:34.880> to

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
animation quality to the art style to

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.699 
animation quality to the art style to
the<00:03:35.480> personalities<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.230> flushing<00:03:36.530> out<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the personalities and flushing out the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.410 
the personalities and flushing out the
personalities<00:03:37.220> along<00:03:37.459> with<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.670> transitions
