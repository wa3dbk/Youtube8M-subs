the<00:06:33.610> drug<00:06:33.849> thing<00:06:34.029> the<00:06:34.360> drugs<00:06:34.630> will<00:06:35.050> at<00:06:35.469> some

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
the drug thing the drugs will at some

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.969 
the drug thing the drugs will at some
point<00:06:36.690> turn<00:06:37.690> that<00:06:37.839> whole<00:06:38.020> Palumbo<00:06:38.440> doesn't

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
point turn that whole Palumbo doesn't

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:39.400 
point turn that whole Palumbo doesn't
think

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
think

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.200 
think
he'll<00:06:39.980> start<00:06:40.220> going<00:06:40.430> backwards<00:06:40.670> so<00:06:40.940> until

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
he'll start going backwards so until

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.210 
he'll start going backwards so until
that<00:06:41.360> happens<00:06:41.750> he's<00:06:42.500> on<00:06:42.620> top<00:06:42.860> and<00:06:43.010> he's<00:06:43.100> gonna

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
that happens he's on top and he's gonna

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.190 
that happens he's on top and he's gonna
be<00:06:43.370> on<00:06:43.490> top<00:06:43.640> and<00:06:43.910> he's<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.840> king<00:06:45.020> of<00:06:45.140> the

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
be on top and he's the the king of the

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.380 
be on top and he's the the king of the
jungle<00:06:45.440> as<00:06:45.650> far<00:06:45.890> as<00:06:46.040> you<00:06:46.550> know<00:06:46.670> many<00:06:47.030> people<00:06:47.210> I

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
jungle as far as you know many people I

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.580 
jungle as far as you know many people I
could<00:06:47.540> started<00:06:47.780> I<00:06:47.870> agree<00:06:48.140> with<00:06:48.260> that<00:06:48.380> at<00:06:48.470> this

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
could started I agree with that at this

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.640 
could started I agree with that at this
point<00:06:48.860> so<00:06:49.640> the<00:06:50.060> only<00:06:50.210> thing<00:06:50.450> you<00:06:50.570> can<00:06:50.750> you<00:06:51.500> know

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
point so the only thing you can you know

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.340 
point so the only thing you can you know
wait<00:06:52.490> for<00:06:52.520> is<00:06:52.880> for<00:06:53.030> that<00:06:53.180> individual<00:06:53.690> like<00:06:54.050> him

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
wait for is for that individual like him

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.290 
wait for is for that individual like him
