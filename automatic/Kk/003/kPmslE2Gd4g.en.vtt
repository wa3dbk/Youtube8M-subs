ombre<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.890> blondes<00:01:50.369> um<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> did<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
ombre for blondes um so what I did is I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.289 
ombre for blondes um so what I did is I
clipped<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.570> hair<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
probably leave it in about four sections

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
probably leave it in about four sections
so<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.360> hair<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.520> relatively<00:02:02.520> short<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.140> in
