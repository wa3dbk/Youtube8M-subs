00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310 
a doe foot applicator I really like this
applicator<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.420> soft<00:01:18.780> and

it's<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.189> spongy<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's not really spongy but it's kind of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's not really spongy but it's kind of
like<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.630> furry<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> weird

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179

comes<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> point<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> top<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.040> can

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.820 
does look like a lip gloss to me as
pretty<00:02:13.489> shiny<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:14.959> have<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.230> my<00:02:15.410> lips<00:02:15.620> is

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
pretty shiny what I have on my lips is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.160 
pretty shiny what I have on my lips is
the<00:02:15.980> Rose<00:02:16.190> redefined<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.630> two<00:02:17.959> coats

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the Rose redefined and it is two coats

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.440 
the Rose redefined and it is two coats
so<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.800> definitely<00:02:19.250> buildable<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:22.450> don't

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
so it's definitely buildable I don't

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.250 
so it's definitely buildable I don't
find<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.900> as<00:02:24.110> pigmented<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.670> lip<00:02:26.030> stick<00:02:26.780> it's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
find it as pigmented as a lip stick it's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.559 
find it as pigmented as a lip stick it's
quite<00:02:27.920> sheer<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.819> buildable<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
quite sheer but it is buildable and I

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.870 
quite sheer but it is buildable and I
think<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:29.930> where<00:02:30.050> they<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.880> lip

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
think that's where they get the lip

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.600 
think that's where they get the lip
color<00:02:32.420> part<00:02:32.959> from<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.890> does<00:02:34.190> have<00:02:34.430> make

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
color part from it is it does have make

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.479 
color part from it is it does have make
pigmentation<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:36.019> build<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.650> it

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
pigmentation and you can build it up it

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.370 
pigmentation and you can build it up it
or<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.120> share<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.390> down<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.840> want<00:02:39.050> but

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
or you can share it down if you want but
