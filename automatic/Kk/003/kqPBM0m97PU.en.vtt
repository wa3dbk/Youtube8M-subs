vault<00:01:00.239> open<00:01:00.690> situation<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.579> gonna

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
vault open situation so so I'm gonna

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.830 
vault open situation so so I'm gonna
reset<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> lock<00:01:05.060> alright<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.210> man<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:06.689> path

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
reset the lock alright so man first path

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
reset the lock alright so man first path
code<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:12.979> walk<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
code one walk over to the first of all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
code one walk over to the first of all
which<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> through<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.470> that's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
which is one through here and that's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
which is one through here and that's
basically<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.460> um<00:01:23.729> it'll<00:01:24.210> only

one thing and it's not a bunch of blue I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
one thing and it's not a bunch of blue I
will<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.900> ahead<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> second<00:01:40.710> one

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
will go ahead and do the second one

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.110 
will go ahead and do the second one
which<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.130> four<00:01:42.409> three<00:01:44.060> two<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.399> one

which is four three two and one

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.539 
which is four three two and one
it's<00:01:50.120> creamer<00:01:50.330> here<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.369> only<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.490> one

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
it's creamer here and only that one

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.230 
it's creamer here and only that one
opens<00:01:52.909> now<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.310> tests<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.030> so

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
baseless tear system is um you have one

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.580 
baseless tear system is um you have one
you<00:01:59.360> have<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.540> lower<00:01:59.720> tier<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.229> higher<00:02:00.380> tier
