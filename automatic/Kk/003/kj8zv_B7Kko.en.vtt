00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.120
 plus 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.150
 are all today we are going to make another 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.160
 nice craft and I'm going to tell you the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.460
 materials that we will need to 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.529
 carry it out we're going to need the part of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.650
 above a container of soda like 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.720
 is 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.439
 we are going to need our silicone 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.439
 liquid 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.940
 we are also going to need some scissors 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.920
 a brush 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.899
 Acrylic paint of the color that you have 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.899
 I'm going to use white but you can use the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.750
 that you have also we are going to need 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.579
 fabric cloth bit me in this case 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.470
 I'm going to use the combination of these two 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.210
 you can use the one you have 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.550
 also to decorate let's use the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 flower like this guy we did in another 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.760
 video in our previous history nothing 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 more than we're going to make it smaller if not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.410
 have you seen this video and you want 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'll leave the link in the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.600
 description 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.109
 and we're also going to need beads 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.109
 like this one 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 and this does not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.540
 so let's start doing the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.210
 craftsmanship today 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.050
 to begin we will grab paint 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.490
 acrylic 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:48.780
 the color is the least does not matter with 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.120
 a brush let's start painting 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.900
 It is not 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.900
 the bottle 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.890
 let's let it dry 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.890
 to continue the next step 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 to cost little strips 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.430
 more or less we need this long and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.579
 this width 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.340
 Well , the piece of 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.819
 bottle and we're going to stick it out of this 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.540
 way then what I do is grab 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.189
 the little piece of cloth like I'm going to grab 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.260
 the glue I use silicon but if you 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.969
 you have another one that you work with 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.280
 you can use it and we cross the fabric of this 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.280
 way that this little one is this way 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.030
 then we apply glue to the bottle 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.030
 and part of the other fabric that we have stuck 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.490
 we put the fabric like this 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.100
 they are staying together 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.100
 and then I reapply 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.260
 glue 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.380
 other 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.960
 piece of fabric of the other color if you 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.080
 nothing else you are going to use only one good color and 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.370
 direct 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.910
 I'm going to do it again as is the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.100
 fold we apply glue 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.970
 part of the fabric 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.970
 we double 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.099
 and then we apply 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.450
 part of the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.450
 of the other fabric 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.720
 and in the bottle 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.720
 so that they are staying pegaditos 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.060
 thus 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.630
 then I will finish the whole part of 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.970
 down when I continue on top 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.120
 I'm going to do the opposite where it is 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.120
 the dark gold I'm going to apply I'm going to 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.180
 put the light golden color will be more or 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.039
 less well up 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.850
 we are going to cover this with the 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.850
 next layer but 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.660
 well here is the tree already finished 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.890
 I already pasted the entire canvas photo two sides 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.360
 at the end to cover the bottle here you 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.360
 I put a piece of cloth 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.340
 to cover on the lid and I did a 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.340
 building 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.490
 in this part of here 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.580
 to be able to put the final ornament 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.009
 I have also been adding these 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.200
 crystals but I'm hitting 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:13.360
 then randomly 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.220
 and finally I'll put it up here 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.190
 This flower 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.070
 what we did in another of the videos if you 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.620
 you have not seen how to make this kind of 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.280
 flowers look for the video I'll leave it 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.910
 up here the link 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.860
 the information box so that it is 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.810
 easy to find how to make this flower in 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.610
 If you want to do it, it's done 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.669
 with toilet paper rolls 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.539
 then it is on one side and on the other 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.409
 I put aside this kind of flower also 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.409
 made with ribbon 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.180
 and this is going to go to here in front of this 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.830
 way buried in it 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.010
 in the hole that I made 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.580
 here is already in our painting and nothing 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.060
 more is to finish putting the crystal 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.060
 pearls 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.889
 in this way putting him 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.740
 a droplet nothing else is not necessary 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.740
 put more 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.080
 silicon on the tip of the fabric 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.470
 in this way 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.949
 yes 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:37.120
 I hope you liked that you saw 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:40.830
 which is very easy and practically 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.830
 It's all recycled 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.950
