our<00:00:11.530> second<00:00:11.860> year<00:00:11.950> of<00:00:12.010> operation<00:00:12.639> we<00:00:12.910> bought<00:00:13.209> a

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
our second year of operation we bought a

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.029 
our second year of operation we bought a
water<00:00:13.930> wheel<00:00:14.080> transplanter<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.859> on<00:00:17.949> the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
water wheel transplanter it's on the

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.740 
water wheel transplanter it's on the
three-point<00:00:18.400> hitch<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.850> tractor<00:00:19.420> would<00:00:19.539> pull

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
three-point hitch a tractor would pull

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.720 
three-point hitch a tractor would pull
it<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.930> basically<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.439> big<00:00:23.590> water<00:00:23.890> tank<00:00:24.010> with

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
it it's basically a big water tank with

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.080 
it it's basically a big water tank with
hoses<00:00:25.030> and<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.619> have<00:00:26.770> these<00:00:26.920> wheels<00:00:27.550> with

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
hoses and you have these wheels with

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.960 
hoses and you have these wheels with
spikes<00:00:28.510> on<00:00:28.810> them<00:00:29.279> under<00:00:30.279> each<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.699> spikes

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
spikes on them under each of the spikes

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.910 
spikes on them under each of the spikes
there's<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.300> hole<00:00:31.510> so<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:32.199> water<00:00:32.410> can<00:00:32.680> come<00:00:32.710> out

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
there's a hole so the water can come out

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.260 
there's a hole so the water can come out
of<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.100> hole<00:00:35.129> these<00:00:36.129> spikes<00:00:36.520> will<00:00:36.760> poke<00:00:37.000> into

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
of the hole these spikes will poke into

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.029 
of the hole these spikes will poke into
the<00:00:37.359> ground<00:00:37.570> either<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:38.079> plastic<00:00:38.230> or<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:38.859> bare

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
the ground either in plastic or in bare

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.219 
the ground either in plastic or in bare
ground<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.460> as<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.120> pokes<00:00:40.449> in<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.690> ground<00:00:40.899> the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
ground and as it pokes in the ground the

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.680 
ground and as it pokes in the ground the
water<00:00:41.530> shoots<00:00:42.100> into<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.519> wheel<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:43.179> fills

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
water shoots into the wheel and fills

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.329 
water shoots into the wheel and fills
those<00:00:44.019> holes<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.710> spikes<00:00:44.949> create<00:00:45.280> in

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
those holes that the spikes create in

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:52.229 
those holes that the spikes create in
the<00:00:45.399> ground<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:49.949> then<00:00:50.949> behind<00:00:51.159> their<00:00:51.789> seats

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the ground and then behind their seats

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.180 
the ground and then behind their seats
and<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:53.139> have<00:00:53.289> people<00:00:53.739> sitting<00:00:53.920> back

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
and so you have people sitting back

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.299 
and so you have people sitting back
there<00:00:54.489> flats<00:00:55.179> plug<00:00:55.780> flats<00:00:56.049> of<00:00:56.530> transplants

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
there flats plug flats of transplants

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.129 
there flats plug flats of transplants
pushing<00:00:57.850> them<00:00:57.969> into<00:00:58.120> those<00:00:58.329> watery<00:00:58.809> muddy

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
pushing them into those watery muddy

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.779 
pushing them into those watery muddy
holes<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.559> use<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.799> transplant<00:01:03.249> on<00:01:03.489> bare

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
holes we use the transplant on bare

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.090 
holes we use the transplant on bare
ground<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.210> black<00:01:04.629> plastic<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.890> only

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
ground and black plastic the only

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.649 
ground and black plastic the only
difference<00:01:06.549> with<00:01:06.700> black<00:01:06.909> plastic<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.570> you

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
difference with black plastic is you

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.880 
difference with black plastic is you
don't<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.960> worry<00:01:08.140> quite<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.409> much<00:01:08.680> about

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
don't have to worry quite so much about

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.230 
don't have to worry quite so much about
in<00:01:09.159> row<00:01:09.369> spacing<00:01:09.820> because<00:01:09.970> you're<00:01:10.060> never

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
in row spacing because you're never

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.400 
in row spacing because you're never
gonna<00:01:10.360> cultivate<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:12.660> we<00:01:13.660> have<00:01:13.780> three<00:01:14.140> wheels

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
gonna cultivate it we have three wheels

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.740 
gonna cultivate it we have three wheels
and<00:01:14.800> so<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.310> either<00:01:15.490> set<00:01:15.910> up<00:01:16.060> three

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and so you can either set up three

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.120 
and so you can either set up three
wheels<00:01:16.960> which<00:01:17.650> would<00:01:17.800> mean<00:01:17.950> you'd<00:01:18.100> be

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
wheels which would mean you'd be

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.980 
wheels which would mean you'd be
planning<00:01:18.520> three<00:01:18.730> rows<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.270> transplants<00:01:19.840> on<00:01:19.960> a

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
planning three rows of transplants on a

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.800 
planning three rows of transplants on a
single<00:01:20.320> bed<00:01:20.470> or<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.890> can<00:01:21.010> have<00:01:21.100> two<00:01:21.280> rows

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
single bed or I can have two rows

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.700 
single bed or I can have two rows
there's<00:01:22.810> lots<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.080> variations<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.530> in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
there's lots of variations and then in

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.180 
there's lots of variations and then in
the<00:01:26.800> actual<00:01:26.950> wheel<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.300> spikes<00:01:28.690> snap<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.890> and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
the actual wheel the spikes snap on and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.100 
the actual wheel the spikes snap on and
off<00:01:30.310> which<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> great<00:01:31.480> improvement<00:01:31.690> used<00:01:32.020> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
off which is a great improvement used to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.870 
off which is a great improvement used to
be<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.260> had<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.440> buy<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.560> exact<00:01:33.100> wheel<00:01:33.340> for

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
be you had to buy the exact wheel for

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
be you had to buy the exact wheel for
the<00:01:34.300> spacing<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:34.870> needed<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.800> was

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
the spacing that you needed and it was

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.430 
the spacing that you needed and it was
just<00:01:36.100> much<00:01:36.220> more<00:01:36.340> expensive<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.030> limiting

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.990 

when<00:01:41.440> we<00:01:41.560> fill<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.070> transplanter<00:01:42.610> with<00:01:42.730> water

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
when we fill the transplanter with water

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.510 
when we fill the transplanter with water
tank<00:01:43.600> as<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.750> hundred<00:01:44.050> gallons<00:01:44.410> or<00:01:44.590> 90<00:01:45.160> gallons

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
tank as a hundred gallons or 90 gallons

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.870 
tank as a hundred gallons or 90 gallons
I<00:01:45.760> think<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.450> put<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.660> quart<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.380> fish<00:01:48.220> emulsion

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
I think we put a quart of fish emulsion

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.990 
I think we put a quart of fish emulsion
it's<00:01:49.360> called<00:01:49.840> Neptune's<00:01:50.290> harvest<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.190> that's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
it's called Neptune's harvest and that's

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's called Neptune's harvest and that's
just<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.390> little<00:01:52.510> extra<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:53.500> nitrogen

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
just for a little extra of nitrogen

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.340 
just for a little extra of nitrogen
right<00:01:54.760> as<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.060> plants<00:01:55.450> are<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:55.810> in<00:01:58.350> the

right as the plants are going in the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
be a drought for a week or you're gonna

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.899 
be a drought for a week or you're gonna
have<00:02:16.659> to<00:02:16.810> set<00:02:16.959> up<00:02:16.989> irrigation<00:02:17.590> BAM<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.700> away

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
have to set up irrigation BAM right away

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.220 
have to set up irrigation BAM right away
to<00:02:19.239> try<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.540> save<00:02:19.689> your<00:02:19.810> Transpo

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
to try and save your Transpo

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.399 
to try and save your Transpo
and<00:02:20.440> we've<00:02:20.890> definitely<00:02:21.069> planted<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.330> whole<00:02:22.569> you

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
and we've definitely planted a whole you

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.410 
and we've definitely planted a whole you
know<00:02:23.530> eight<00:02:23.950> beds<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.400> something<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
know eight beds of something and the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.960 
know eight beds of something and the
next<00:02:25.450> day<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.989> gone<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.400> wasn't<00:02:27.790> wet

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
next day it's gone because it wasn't wet

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.559 
next day it's gone because it wasn't wet
and<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.450> tripled<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.519> happens<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.730> where's

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
and it tripled it happens and where's

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.820 
and it tripled it happens and where's
what<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> waterwheel<00:02:32.110> basically<00:02:32.620> doesn't

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
what the waterwheel basically doesn't

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.580 
what the waterwheel basically doesn't
happen<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:34.750> that's<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.110> number<00:02:35.409> one

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
happen I think that's the number one

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
happen I think that's the number one
advantage<00:02:36.129> of<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.459> waterwheel<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
advantage of the waterwheel is this you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
advantage of the waterwheel is this you
know<00:02:37.540> if<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.810> plant<00:02:38.049> something<00:02:38.260> you're<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
know if you plant something you're that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.960 
know if you plant something you're that
much<00:02:38.980> more<00:02:39.099> guarantee<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:39.879> gonna<00:02:40.000> work

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
much more guarantee that it's gonna work

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.119 
much more guarantee that it's gonna work
the<00:02:42.970> other<00:02:43.150> advantages<00:02:43.810> your<00:02:44.590> crew<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:44.950> much

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
the other advantages your crew is much

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.940 
the other advantages your crew is much
happier<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.840> think<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.140> crew<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.470> get<00:02:47.590> more<00:02:47.769> done

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
happier I think a crew can get more done

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.259 
happier I think a crew can get more done
with<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.190> transplant<00:02:48.549> because<00:02:49.060> they're

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
with the transplant because they're

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.569 
with the transplant because they're
happy<00:02:49.629> and<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:50.890> they're<00:02:51.040> comfortable<00:02:51.220> so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
happy and because they're comfortable so

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.240 
happy and because they're comfortable so
they<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.819> keep<00:02:51.970> doing<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.360> for<00:02:52.540> longer<00:02:53.250> our

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
they can keep doing it for longer our

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.190 
they can keep doing it for longer our
number<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.790> goal<00:02:54.910> anyway<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.720> really

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
number one goal anyway is to get really

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.420 
number one goal anyway is to get really
healthy<00:02:56.410> transplants<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.099> want<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.340> make

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
healthy transplants so we want to make

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.770 
healthy transplants so we want to make
sure<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:57.879> really<00:02:57.910> take<00:02:58.480> their<00:02:58.629> time

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
sure that they really take their time

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.539 
sure that they really take their time
and<00:02:58.840> make<00:02:59.260> sure<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.560> they're<00:02:59.709> well<00:02:59.829> planted

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.949 

if<00:03:03.549> you're<00:03:03.819> really<00:03:04.060> trying<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.480> bust<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.870> out

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
if you're really trying to bust it out

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.680 
if you're really trying to bust it out
what<00:03:05.170> might<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.680> more<00:03:06.340> efficient<00:03:07.000> labor<00:03:07.480> wise

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
what might be more efficient labor wise

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.960 
what might be more efficient labor wise
is<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.410> driver<00:03:08.680> go<00:03:08.950> through<00:03:09.250> mark

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
is to have the driver go through mark

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.699 
is to have the driver go through mark
all<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> holes<00:03:10.450> get<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.170> water<00:03:11.349> in<00:03:11.560> all<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
all the holes get the water in all the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.770 
all the holes get the water in all the
holes<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:13.450> could<00:03:13.569> do<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.810> really<00:03:13.930> fast<00:03:15.780> park

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
holes you could do that really fast park

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.050 
holes you could do that really fast park
the<00:03:16.930> tractor<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.859> then<00:03:18.340> everyone<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:18.879> come

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
the tractor and then everyone can come

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.849 
the tractor and then everyone can come
back<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.390> hand<00:03:19.599> transplant<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.709> it's

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
back and hand transplant and it's

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.729 
back and hand transplant and it's
actually<00:03:21.160> probably<00:03:21.340> faster<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.470> there's<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
actually probably faster so there's a

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.710 
actually probably faster so there's a
couple<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.370> crops<00:03:27.609> that<00:03:27.790> we<00:03:27.940> still<00:03:28.569> do

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
couple of crops that we still do

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.349 
couple of crops that we still do
transplant<00:03:29.200> by<00:03:29.349> hand<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.269> those

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
transplant by hand one of those

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.530 
transplant by hand one of those
strawberries<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.579> really<00:03:33.819> big<00:03:34.239> root

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
strawberries they have a really big root

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.259 
strawberries they have a really big root
system<00:03:35.019> that<00:03:35.049> needs<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.680> placed<00:03:36.370> fairly

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
system that needs to be placed fairly

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.210 
system that needs to be placed fairly
precisely<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.959> soil<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.500> takes<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.950> bit

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
precisely in the soil and it takes a bit

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.039 
precisely in the soil and it takes a bit
of<00:03:39.250> time<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:40.150> plant<00:03:40.450> each<00:03:40.660> strawberry

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
of time to plant each strawberry

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.140 
of time to plant each strawberry
transplant<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.669> doesn't<00:03:42.849> make<00:03:42.940> any<00:03:43.030> sense

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
transplant so it doesn't make any sense

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.409 
transplant so it doesn't make any sense
to<00:03:43.540> do<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.169> transplant<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:46.329> know

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
to do it with the transplant you know

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.479 
to do it with the transplant you know
some<00:03:46.599> things<00:03:46.660> are<00:03:47.049> call<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.859> whether<00:03:48.310> you

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
some things are call of whether you

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.430 
some things are call of whether you
should<00:03:48.519> hand<00:03:48.880> transplant<00:03:49.419> it<00:03:49.569> or<00:03:49.780> use<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
should hand transplant it or use the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.830 
should hand transplant it or use the
water<00:03:50.590> wheel<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:51.760> our<00:03:51.910> case<00:03:52.120> one<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.480> those<00:03:52.690> as

onions<00:03:53.319> we<00:03:54.130> grow<00:03:54.340> onion<00:03:54.819> transplants<00:03:55.769> they're

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
onions we grow onion transplants they're

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.409 
onions we grow onion transplants they're
just<00:03:56.950> kind<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.549> small<00:03:57.819> when<00:03:58.090> you're<00:03:58.209> first

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
just kind of so small when you're first

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.909 
just kind of so small when you're first
transplanting<00:03:59.230> them<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.470> it's<00:03:59.799> like

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
transplanting them that it's like

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.020 
transplanting them that it's like
transplanting<00:04:00.519> a<00:04:00.579> hair<00:04:01.410> into<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> puddle<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
transplanting a hair into a puddle and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.670 
transplanting a hair into a puddle and
it's<00:04:04.840> hard<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.109> do<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.200> really<00:04:05.410> good<00:04:05.500> job<00:04:05.620> with

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
it's hard to do a really good job with

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.800 
it's hard to do a really good job with
water<00:04:05.980> we<00:04:06.129> also<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:07.060> case<00:04:07.120> most<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
water we also in that case most of the
