play is the best way to spread the game
and<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:42.120> exposure<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:43.530> could<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> told<00:01:44.100> them

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and get exposure we could have told them

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.010

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.640 
of empires online the reason is simple
it's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.539 
it's
too<00:02:40.739> expensive<00:02:41.510> age<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.810> empires<00:02:42.989> online<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
too expensive age of empires online the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.460 
too expensive age of empires online the
studio<00:02:45.090> said<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.720> development<00:02:46.349> of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.920 
studio said that the development of
these<00:02:46.650> updates<00:02:47.159> is<00:02:47.370> expensive<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.360> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
these updates is expensive and so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.039 
these updates is expensive and so
