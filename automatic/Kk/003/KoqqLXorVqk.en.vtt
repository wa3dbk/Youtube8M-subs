00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.150 
then you may be inclined to look the
other<00:05:27.130> way<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:28.930> scored<00:05:29.229> insecticide<00:05:29.889> a

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
other way I have scored insecticide a

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.370 
other way I have scored insecticide a
six<00:05:30.550> point<00:05:30.880> two<00:05:31.060> for<00:05:31.419> project<00:05:31.750> seaweed

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
six point two for project seaweed

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.529 
six point two for project seaweed
since<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:32.950> not<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:33.130> bad<00:05:33.400> game<00:05:33.639> but<00:05:34.150> easily

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
since it's not a bad game but easily

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.870 
since it's not a bad game but easily
nothing<00:05:34.720> all<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.050> good<00:05:35.440> either<00:05:35.560> if<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.700> wish

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
nothing all that good either if you wish

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.029 
nothing all that good either if you wish
to<00:05:37.000> try<00:05:37.180> this<00:05:37.240> one<00:05:37.539> out<00:05:37.570> by<00:05:38.229> all<00:05:38.380> means<00:05:38.680> do<00:05:39.010> so

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
to try this one out by all means do so

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.110 
to try this one out by all means do so
but<00:05:39.910> don't<00:05:40.150> say<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.389> didn't<00:05:40.750> warn<00:05:40.930> ya

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.730 

so<00:05:45.120> it's<00:05:45.330> unfortunate<00:05:45.509> that<00:05:46.139> not<00:05:46.349> all<00:05:46.500> games

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
so it's unfortunate that not all games

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.830 
so it's unfortunate that not all games
are<00:05:46.949> destined<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.340> be<00:05:47.460> triple-a<00:05:47.940> but<00:05:48.659> that's

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
are destined to be triple-a but that's

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.879 
are destined to be triple-a but that's
part<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.110> what<00:05:49.259> makes<00:05:49.409> this<00:05:49.590> job<00:05:49.830> so

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
part of what makes this job so

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.909 
part of what makes this job so
interesting<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.759> a<00:05:51.300> little<00:05:51.419> easier<00:05:51.870> we<00:05:52.710> take

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
interesting and a little easier we take

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.680 
interesting and a little easier we take
a<00:05:52.949> good<00:05:53.159> deal<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.400> time<00:05:53.759> reviewing<00:05:54.150> games<00:05:54.509> that

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
a good deal of time reviewing games that

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.170 
a good deal of time reviewing games that
are<00:05:54.780> great<00:05:55.020> and<00:05:55.319> less<00:05:55.949> for<00:05:56.190> those<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.580> aren't

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
are great and less for those that aren't

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.930 
are great and less for those that aren't
