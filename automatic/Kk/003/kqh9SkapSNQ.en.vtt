00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.260
 that guys are go today i 'm here 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 with my first video on me I enjoy it 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:17.939
 up on the world he lies up there 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.329
 I'm in the world of skyrim 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:26.229
 as you have noticed and this is mine 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:31.479
 first video in which I try to make a 

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:37.600
 review even if it is not so bono 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:39.040
 has the fuck leagues in live shows with that one 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.470
 people also like this is the christ 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.270
 moving on his left moving right 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.780
 on the left you know that I am the life 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:54.430
 ball and he goes wrong but he goes round 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:56.230
 this is my full tilt character but 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.110
 however, here they are beautiful texture 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 of the pink water with which however a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.350
 tell you about skins on what is me 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.649
 liked I did not like the game a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.229
 make some comparisons with opinion leaders 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:13.030
 however, I immediately know the style 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.079
 completely different example also 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.469
 in different style houses I say more Gothic 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.469
 however it is someone who has studied a minimum of 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.179
 art history knows that obliges has 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.889
 played clean updated to this see 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.869
 however that is in the cities as they are 

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:34.040
 built or respect stay skinny moblin 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.030
 they are different 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.010
 the style then less the growth of 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.590
 character is completely different 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.330
 sublime I don't remember how you find it 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.370
 I remember we say other games of 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.370
 Voting role rises in level earns 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.050
 20 points and then 20 points of the TV sense 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:59.690
 nor from the 10 light armor 5 ha instead 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.670
 here closed one thing is more powerful 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.070
 for example, if you always play with weapons 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.570
 I know no more damage to a hand like that 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.209
 fi or more enemies kill and more skill 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.130
 it also increases salts level gains 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:22.310
 a point bonus point from this point 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:25.280
 bonus you can use it to pick up the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
 skills that give you bonds always up 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.580
 which years in hand in the fridge in 60 for 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.060
 a hundred of the extra damages I had 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.630
 now the bonus point increased and I did 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.800
 which give less however are nice map 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.209
 This is what I unlocked myself at 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.560
 abnormal maps something you nori in 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.560
 map is huge 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:58.790
 then the spells became a splash 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.420
 really at the most however also for 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.989
 those who complain about all manners 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.989
 same thing applies to 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.760
 the sympathy however they did it 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.180
 see in 3d 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.440
 among other things, to consume cinema 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.770
 quite unnecessary finally likeable for 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:30.140
 see we go as done for objects in 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:34.430
 3d veil luca other been the fuck e 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.160
 nothing difference we say there is substance 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.880
 So from oblivion he went from self ago 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.990
 the other in Valais because anyway 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.220
 always the same developer 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.530
 bethesda there are not always we say 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.830
 the role-playing game grows on you 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 character she missions example 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.500
 this character that full tilt 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:03.740
 I did it. I let him in 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.310
 on the agenda of thieves in the gil dona dei 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.570
 thieves 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:14.390
 what is amsc 's house so i show 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:17.209
 so much at the pole they put the a 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.680
 shortcut so at least not every time 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:26.110
 must go all my power is activated 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.810
 I walk around nothing invisible because 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.040
 missions finance power I'm not there 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.560
 will strip the juggle here we use the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.390
 my story here we do not know uses shots 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:47.080
 however mandelli always similar vivione 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:49.360
 other young people and then this one 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.870
 then to have improved for some facts 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.970
 I was visually saying graphics 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.479
 james pohl complained because anyway it is 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:05.860
 a huge game from what I read there 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:08.680
 they want about 300 a cock they want 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.009
 about 13 because this is the skulls 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.250
 time at home so a satanic cult in 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:20.919
 home takes about 300 hours to finish it 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.659
 summer cat hd quite seen 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:28.259
 level this level 20 which below born 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.259
 visible 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.969
 I'm level 20 I've seen from 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.979
 goals that the levels after 50 with tape 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:44.289
 I finally put a brothel in it 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:46.659
 so I think that up to 50 ci 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.599
 he really wants so many hours 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:54.759
 this is then untangled disk mac 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:06:01.320
 skills list the faults of the faust le 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:06.790
 disruptive timing emissions 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.800
 main mission runs around turns 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.450
 around all the history and the quests of 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.730
 various guilds of guilds here 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:20.200
 since there is the addition of the says la 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.010
 dark brotherhood I have to chapter like 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.700
 feel momolo go on the internet 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.660
 must kill 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:33.450
 where are the people to kill fast fast 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.710
 and kills in the people here and bam bam bam 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.280
 nada I have nothing else to add 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.900
 therefore, however, these are the first impressions 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.320
 in a while the game happens 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.470
 by playing at the beginning he had to 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.790
 pay because it was completely different 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.820
 from what I expected and seeing some 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:02.380
 bug and some other normal day 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:06.520
 what is the huge textures a 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:11.680
 draw makes the textures the game and 9 is 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:14.770
 post some kind of bug exists between the 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.170
 campaign the call of duty lasts six hours a 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.580
 There must be no drop in campaigns 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:26.770
 Hall of the Dead I will not enter the hall 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:29.400
 of the dead is however from facts from the 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:33.360
 dark knight with pupils 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:37.289
 invisible what the blue dots are there 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.659
 he gives to the eyes and has said and everything 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:42.439
 we feel the thing but for me the thing 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.439
 beautiful
