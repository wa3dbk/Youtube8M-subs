00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.000 
100 blur methods ooh quality good hit
okay<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:43.510> don't<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.380> think<00:02:44.500> that's<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.860> big

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
okay I don't really think that's a big

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.270 
okay I don't really think that's a big
enough<00:02:45.160> blur<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.730> just<00:02:45.880> keep<00:02:46.030> hitting<00:02:46.180> ctrl<00:02:46.690> f

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
enough blur so just keep hitting ctrl f

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.090 
enough blur so just keep hitting ctrl f
until<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.640> shine<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.239> want

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
until you get the shine that you want

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.460 
until you get the shine that you want
and<00:02:51.100> once<00:02:51.310> you're<00:02:51.519> done<00:02:51.640> with<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.470> deselect

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and once you're done with that deselect

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.890 
and once you're done with that deselect
that<00:02:54.000> now<00:02:55.000> we're<00:02:55.180> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.330> get<00:02:55.420> our<00:02:55.570> gradient

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
that now we're going to get our gradient

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.140 
that now we're going to get our gradient
tool<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:56.890> give<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.310> picture<00:02:57.940> some

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150

click hold it down and draw a line
across<00:03:25.269> your<00:03:25.780> screen<00:03:26.370> that'll<00:03:27.370> make<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.510> go

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
across your screen that'll make it go

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.120 
across your screen that'll make it go
from<00:03:28.870> one<00:03:29.080> into<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.440> spectrum<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:30.010> your

from one into the spectrum of your
gradient<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.760> other<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.870> starts<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:32.290> red

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
gradient to the other so starts with red

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.440 
gradient to the other so starts with red
down<00:03:32.650> here<00:03:32.860> than<00:03:33.040> goes<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> yellow<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:34.270> can

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
down here than goes to yellow you can

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.610 
down here than goes to yellow you can
make<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.630> go<00:03:35.010> straight<00:03:36.010> across<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.550> screen

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
make a go straight across the screen

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.420 
make a go straight across the screen
you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.730> make<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:38.909> go<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.900> way<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:41.700> way

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
you can make it go this way this way

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.369 
you can make it go this way this way
doesn't<00:03:44.430> really<00:03:44.549> matter<00:03:44.930> just<00:03:45.930> keep<00:03:46.170> fiddling

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
doesn't really matter just keep fiddling

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.140 
doesn't really matter just keep fiddling
with<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.099> want<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.430> shorted<00:03:47.879> line

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
with that so you want the shorted line

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.119 
with that so you want the shorted line
the<00:03:48.450> less<00:03:48.629> extreme<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.379> color<00:03:49.590> change<00:03:49.950> will

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
the less extreme the color change will

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.509 
the less extreme the color change will
be<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:51.599> not<00:03:52.590> extreme<00:03:52.860> at<00:03:53.099> all<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
be see that's not extreme at all and

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.080 
be see that's not extreme at all and
that<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> go<00:03:56.819> with

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that is so I'm going to go with

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:06.680 
that is so I'm going to go with
something<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.989> this<00:04:00.769> yeah<00:04:02.420> um<00:04:05.150> yeah<00:04:06.150> now

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
something like this yeah um yeah now

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.509 
something like this yeah um yeah now
what<00:04:07.200> you're<00:04:07.319> going<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> do<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.950> take<00:04:08.340> your

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
what you're going to do is take your

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.030 
what you're going to do is take your
smudge<00:04:08.909> tool<00:04:08.940> if<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.629> don't<00:04:09.810> see<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.440> in

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
smudge tool if you don't see it it's in

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.470 
smudge tool if you don't see it it's in
the<00:04:11.280> same<00:04:12.109> section<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.200> blur<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.709> sharpen<00:04:14.480> and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
the same section is blur and sharpen and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.879 
the same section is blur and sharpen and
you're<00:04:15.629> just<00:04:15.750> going<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.280> pull<00:04:17.280> out<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:18.889> part

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
you're just going to pull out the part

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.890 
you're just going to pull out the part
of<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> planet<00:04:20.690> straight<00:04:21.690> out<00:04:23.720> kind<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.780> make

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
of the planet straight out kind of make

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.439 
of the planet straight out kind of make
little<00:04:25.229> flares<00:04:25.970> like<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.180> going<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.389> explode

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
little flares like it's going to explode

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.070 
little flares like it's going to explode
or<00:04:28.260> something<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.940> put<00:04:30.150> these<00:04:30.419> wherever<00:04:30.900> you

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
or something and put these wherever you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.950 
or something and put these wherever you
want<00:04:31.350> your<00:04:32.100> image<00:04:32.340> up<00:04:32.639> don't<00:04:33.270> do<00:04:33.539> like<00:04:33.780> you're

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
want your image up don't do like you're

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.490 
want your image up don't do like you're
trying<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.260> make<00:04:34.350> fire<00:04:34.830> with<00:04:35.190> squiggly<00:04:36.150> lines

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
trying to make fire with squiggly lines

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.159 
trying to make fire with squiggly lines
like<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.530> because<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:39.419> my<00:04:39.690> opinion<00:04:39.840> it

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
like that because in my opinion it

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.360 
like that because in my opinion it
doesn't<00:04:40.320> look<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:40.650> good<00:04:40.740> i<00:04:40.860> mean<00:04:41.130> if<00:04:41.280> you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
doesn't look as good i mean if you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.450 
doesn't look as good i mean if you
really<00:04:41.400> want<00:04:41.849> to<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.450> but<00:04:42.930> i'm<00:04:43.889> not<00:04:44.280> i'm

really want to you can but i'm not i'm
just<00:04:44.490> doing<00:04:44.910> straight<00:04:45.120> lines<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:47.729> just<00:04:48.030> put

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
just doing straight lines and just put

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.860 
just doing straight lines and just put
those<00:04:48.419> wherever<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.229> think<00:04:50.599> should<00:04:51.599> they

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
those wherever you think should they
