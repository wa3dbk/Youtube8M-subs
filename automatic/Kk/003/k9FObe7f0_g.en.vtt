 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.650
 car tester my name is frank 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.660
 Jacques Hello Mr. Frank and I show 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.800
 Join the adidas learning system today 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.229
 Thank you very much 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.140
 we see the body mapping system here 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.700
 Sweats on the base layer in this zone 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.830
 the male body especially strong 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.890
 that's why a fabric is special here 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.860
 This zone pulls well 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.790
 through all the layers and through each one 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.100
 layer complements please once 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.110
 next layer long depending on the climate can 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.820
 so the entire length of the ring system 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.979
 remove and when it gets colder 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.080
 Just straighten it up 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.540
 when skitourengehen one comes to times 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.149
 sweat but arrived at the top less 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.780
 It gets cold and therefore the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.820
 next shift 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.710
 thank you with once in there we see 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.840
 here are the zones we have in the base layer 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.910
 you pull yourself out so you can 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.399
 evaporate it from the inside out 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.410
 there is no moisture buildup this 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.789
 concept continues in the 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.390
 hardt shield by please once the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.390
 handcuffed off 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.769
 the adidas layering system 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.260
 here in the terrex sky climb has shell 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.459
 the crowning conclusion 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.769
 please turn job again we see 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.590
 here the back end with the formation 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.599
 technology is in dispute 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 one has here in the shoulder area the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.489
 full freedom of movement and still 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.190
 this area can evaporate over it 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.900
 In addition, this hair cell offers us the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.650
 usual comfort we know 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.049
 Here are chest bags we have here 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.920
 side pockets and we have here long 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.720
 great that when it's really warm 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 The body can be perfect here 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.310
 evaporate ensures rapid cooling 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.590
 Thank you very much for having a nice little jacket 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.810
 we also have a big helmet suitable hood 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.150
 and that means when it's on top of that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.849
 mountain just right whistles easy 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.250
 break down and still full 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.629
 because of the fabric because of the fabric 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000
 we have an absolute 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.690
 Freedom of movement, nevertheless, always beautiful 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.690
 warm ears 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.220
 Many Thanks 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.620
 the geneva moisture management 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.420
 reached through all the layers 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.840
 adidas by using the coconut 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.700
 Technology here will be on the fabric 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.319
 carbon particles printed on it and that 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.450
 means that if now the sweat 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.610
 arrives on a large surface 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.370
 spread and can now go outside 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.590
 So we evaporate through all 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.049
 lay through perfect jacket climate 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.420
 to all-round feel-good package at this kind 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.480
 There are many more details 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 example, we have adjustable here 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.829
 to the train 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.349
 we sewed in pocket here 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.450
 bags bag here can not do anything 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.070
 fall through reinforced knew 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.870
 furthermore we have one here 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.740
 extra breast pocket and we have here 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.080
 adjustable sleeves through velcro strip 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.150
 further fine detail is here 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.760
 gutter we should see anyway 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.950
 Run from the top water in the collar 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.960
 it is discharged here in the gutter 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.169
 and down to the hopefully then 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.669
 also passed waterproof rose 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:47.870
 Zippers are waterproof here 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:51.450
 the weather stays great outside then 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.880
 under the sofa for quick lifts or 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.060
 as the homeowner says bumps 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.680
 here you can get climate fast in the year 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.680
 ensure good passage 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.590
 big bright hood adjustment help 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.590
 not an open minded front 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.600
 Hidden the cord stocker is there 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.810
 but can not see him he can 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.480
 prevent nothing more 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.190

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.320
 have no superfluous ends 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.110
 here are even the cord stopper 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.810
