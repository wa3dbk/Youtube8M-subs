00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
months back i did another one here and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.739 
months back i did another one here and
this<00:00:23.259> is<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:24.490> rear<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.759> valve<00:00:25.089> cover<00:00:25.359> for

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
this is the the rear of valve cover for

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.540 
this is the the rear of valve cover for
my<00:00:25.839> nissan<00:00:26.199> quest<00:00:26.380> recently<00:00:27.159> how<00:00:27.249> to<00:00:27.310> change

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
my nissan quest recently how to change

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.519 
my nissan quest recently how to change
out<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.970> front<00:00:28.419> one<00:00:28.599> so<00:00:28.989> there's<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.320> front

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
out the front one so there's the front

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.010 
out the front one so there's the front
one<00:00:29.679> and<00:00:30.009> i<00:00:30.849> think<00:00:31.089> i<00:00:31.300> might<00:00:31.449> try<00:00:31.659> a<00:00:31.689> different

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
one and i think i might try a different

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.380 
one and i think i might try a different
color<00:00:32.200> maybe<00:00:32.529> blue<00:00:32.890> i'm<00:00:33.730> not<00:00:33.940> sure<00:00:34.000> right<00:00:34.329> now

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
color maybe blue i'm not sure right now

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.860 
color maybe blue i'm not sure right now
but<00:00:34.899> i'll<00:00:35.079> be<00:00:35.230> doing<00:00:35.379> some<00:00:35.649> cutting<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.870> open

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
but i'll be doing some cutting and open

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.290 
but i'll be doing some cutting and open
this<00:00:37.989> up<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:38.949> can<00:00:39.100> accommodate<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.940> clock

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
this up so it can accommodate the clock

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.770 
this up so it can accommodate the clock
when<00:00:41.199> i<00:00:41.260> installed<00:00:41.710> out<00:00:41.859> here<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.570> i'll<00:00:43.629> be<00:00:43.750> a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.589 

so<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.189> package<00:02:41.609> is<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.060> clock<00:02:42.329> that'll

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
so in this package is the clock that'll

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.000 
so in this package is the clock that'll
be<00:02:42.689> using<00:02:43.079> for<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.530> valve<00:02:43.799> cover<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.689> open

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
be using for the valve cover and open

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.229 
be using for the valve cover and open
this<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.219> I'll<00:02:47.609> show<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.879> what<00:02:47.999> the<00:02:48.060> clock

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
this up I'll show you what the clock

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.949 
this up I'll show you what the clock
looks<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.629> inside<00:02:53.420> now<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.480> reason<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:54.780> chose

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
looks like inside now the reason I chose

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.690 
looks like inside now the reason I chose
this<00:02:55.019> one<00:02:55.349> is<00:02:55.500> because<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:56.040> has<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.189> very<00:02:56.430> nice

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
this one is because it has a very nice

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.479 
this one is because it has a very nice
big<00:02:57.180> display<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> back<00:02:59.129> there's<00:02:59.430> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
plastic tab for the battery pull this

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.909 
plastic tab for the battery pull this
out<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:03.239> as<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.109> can<00:03:04.200> see<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.500> has<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> very

look pretty good I have this ruler here
that<00:06:24.469> will<00:06:24.560> help<00:06:24.710> me<00:06:24.919> center<00:06:25.340> at<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.550> emblem

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
that will help me center at the emblem

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.260
