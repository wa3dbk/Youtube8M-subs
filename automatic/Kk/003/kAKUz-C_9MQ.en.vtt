00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
seen earlier on the ingame map however

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
seen earlier on the ingame map however
the<00:01:28.500> ways<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.070> portrayed<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> map<00:01:29.970> it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the ways it's portrayed on the map it's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
the ways it's portrayed on the map it's
not<00:01:30.420> even<00:01:30.630> close<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.560> looks

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
not even close to how it actually looks

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.760 
not even close to how it actually looks
like<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> entire

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
like as you can see from here the entire

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.670 
like as you can see from here the entire
lake<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.549> wider<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.259> heading

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
lake is a lot wider it also is heading

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
lake is a lot wider it also is heading
north<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:38.490> can't<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.820> sure<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.180> there's<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
north we can't be sure but there's a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.539 
north we can't be sure but there's a
possibility<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> petersburg<00:01:41.070> lake<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
possibility that the petersburg lake is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
possibility that the petersburg lake is
until<00:01:41.880> 8<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> river<00:01:43.200> coming

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
until 8 but more like a river coming

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.370 
until 8 but more like a river coming
from<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.070> city<00:01:44.399> textures<00:01:44.850> direction<00:01:45.420> also

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
from that city textures direction also

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
from that city textures direction also
remember<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> city<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> mountain<00:01:48.479> we've

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
remember the city on the mountain we've

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.560 
remember the city on the mountain we've
seen<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:49.380> desperation<00:01:49.740> Ridge<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
seen from desperation Ridge that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
seen from desperation Ridge that
mountain<00:01:51.570> over<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.439> exact<00:01:52.829> same

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
mountain over there is the exact same

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
mountain over there is the exact same
but<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.030> its<00:01:54.210> other<00:01:54.390> side<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
but is its other side where also is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
but is its other side where also is
another<00:01:56.130> city<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.909> we're<00:01:57.450> assuming<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
another city and we're assuming that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
another city and we're assuming that
these<00:01:58.350> two<00:01:58.770> cities<00:01:59.070> may<00:01:59.280> connect<00:01:59.700> somehow

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
these two cities may connect somehow

like<00:02:00.360> why<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> tunnel<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.619> something<00:02:01.979> through

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
like why a tunnel is something through

possibility of that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600
