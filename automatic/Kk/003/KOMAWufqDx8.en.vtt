00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hi, welcome to the board in this class. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.769
 Let's talk about the process of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 fermentation that is carried out by 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 bacteria 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 good as I told you as well as in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.239
 cellular respiration in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 bacteria will break down molecules 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:33.079
 organic molecules ie these molecules 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:38.420
 are going to be degraded will be 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 and in this process of degradation 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.930
 will occur the release of energy 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 only when compared to breathing 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.130
 cell phone 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.400
 the amount of energy released in the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.250
 fermentation process is much lower 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.340
 because the degradation of the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.960
 molecules here in this process 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.020
 is incomplete or is not even all energy 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.250
 contained in the organic molecules will be 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 released and so 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.049
 In total the fermentation releases a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.390
 amount of energy less than the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.420
 cellular respiration 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 the main organic compound that is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.319
 used by these bacteria is the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.319
 glucose to glucose you know is composed 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.710
 for six carbon atoms each ball 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.109
 of which represents the carbon atom 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.139
 in the fermentation process 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:41.490
 this glucose molecule will first go 

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:45.450
 receive two phosphate groups 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.990
 in these phosphate groups actually in this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 linking these groups to the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.909
 there is a large amount of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.459
 energy 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.210
 okay, and this molecule being 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.450
 formed that is called fructose 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 behold phosphate and how those facts were 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.160
 inserted here good by the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.630
 molecules of atp two molecules of atp 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.840
 will be broken down by providing the phosphate a 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 for each tip of the molecule and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.060
 molecules of DNA and p 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.580
 let's remember that atp is the currency 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.280
 widely used in several 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.769
 metabolic reactions of several 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 organisms 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:41.040
 continuing after receiving this phosphate 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.019
 this molecule will be divided into two 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.050
 smaller molecules two smaller molecules 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.170
 containing three carbons each and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.930
 of the three carbons also two groups 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.970
 phosphate, each of these new molecules 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.550
 formed ok 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.620
 and those forced are added here 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.070
 in the middle of the process 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.000
 soon after these molecules do not 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.090
 lose the facts and then we'll have two 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.880
 very important molecules containing 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 three carbons each which are the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.230
 peru viko acid molecules what 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:27.269
 happened during this process was that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.840
 two dp DNA molecules captured the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.900
 facts of a molecule and there 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.239
 two atp molecules and for the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.380
 second molecule the same thing two 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.950
 molecules of DNA and p captured the facts 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.280
 of the molecule in which two atp 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.200
 so look at all this process we 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.579
 we initially had the consumption of two atp 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.590
 two energy currencies and we have the 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:04.459
 formation of four ATP molecules 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.239
 soon the energy balance of the fermentation is 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.090
 equal to 2 until ps because I produce 4 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.370
 but I have consumed 2 and the balance is equal to 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.340
 amount produced - the quantity 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.040
 used balance then from two until 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.190
 In person, this is the energy balance 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.370
 fermentation that is much smaller than the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.370
 energetic balance of cellular respiration and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.639
 Peruffo this acid this acid pyrophosphate am 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.639
 can be transformed into several types 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.820
 of substances depending on the bacterium 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.800
 then for example this acid peruffo 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.160
 can be transformed into lactic acid 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.620
 bacteria of the genus Streptococcus 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.780
 lactobacilli bacilli are bacteria that 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.660
 perform this procedure 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.979
 to convert the pyrous acid to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.650
 including many of these bacteria. 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:04.310
 used for the manufacture of 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.039
 foods such as cheeses and yogurts 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.320
 many of these bacteria also advocate 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.330
 our bodies to bacteria that are 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.510
 present in our mouth for example 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.870
 and that produce lactic acid lace 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.669
 that is produced by them impedes the 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.380
 development of other types of 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.050
 bacterial bacteria that could 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.360
 including causing diseases 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.530
 a further target for acid 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.000
 peruffo depending on bacterial species 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.860
 is the acetic acid bacteria of the genus 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.050
 bacterial bacteria are bacteria that 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.950
 turn the turkey's into acid 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.889
 acetic acid and yet another example 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.550
 some bacteria also transforms the 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.610
 pyroic acid in butanol acid was 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.449
 my case 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.509
 bacteria of the Clostridium genus and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.729
 there is a type of bacterial fermentation 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.409
 which is also very important for the 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:07.860
 industry that is alcoholic fermentation 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:11.030
 in this fermentation alcohol molecules 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:16.800
 Here we have ethyl alcohol. 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:19.469
 are converted to acetic acid 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.569
 which is the molecule of acetic acid and here 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:25.710
 we still have the production of molecules 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:29.039
 This acetic acid is very 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.509
 important for the industry as well. 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:36.110
 it is composed of spices and also of 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:39.900
 products that preserve food 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.349
 bacteria of the genus acetobacter and also 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.479
 of the genus group on the back ter are 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:49.129
 bacteria that perform this fermentation 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:53.610
 which is called alcoholic fermentation 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:55.199
 converts ethnic album into acetic acid 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.569
 good people, I hope you have 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.509
 understood in the next class we go 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.680
 studying bacterial reproduction does not 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.680
 lose and until then
