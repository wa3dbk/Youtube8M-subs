00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that game and some things i think

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.560 
that game and some things i think
they're<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> need<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> continue<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
they're going to need to continue in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
they're going to need to continue in
this<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
this one and that one well and one of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
this one and that one well and one of
them<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.179> forcing<00:00:30.990> turnovers<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.710> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
them is forcing turnovers they got that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.220 
them is forcing turnovers they got that
big<00:00:31.859> pick<00:00:32.399> six<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> tom<00:00:33.059> brady<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:34.050> thing

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
big pick six of tom brady one thing

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.479

about<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> Jets<00:00:34.710> defense<00:00:34.800> they're<00:00:35.309> good

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
about the Jets defense they're good

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.040 
about the Jets defense they're good
statistically<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.420> they've<00:00:36.540> only<00:00:36.690> forced

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
statistically but they've only forced

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
statistically but they've only forced
four<00:00:37.350> turnovers<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.070> year<00:00:38.340> they've

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
four turnovers this year they've

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.030 
four turnovers this year they've
committed<00:00:39.210> 15<00:00:39.750> turnovers<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> often<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.920> they

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
committed 15 turnovers and often so they

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
committed 15 turnovers and often so they
have<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> minus<00:00:41.399> 11<00:00:42.030> turnover<00:00:42.989> differential

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
have a minus 11 turnover differential

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
have a minus 11 turnover differential
which<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.550> hurts<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.180> when

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
which I think really hurts them when

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
which I think really hurts them when
they<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> road<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.079> play<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> tough

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they go on the road and play a tough

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
they go on the road and play a tough
team<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.210> bangles<00:00:48.660> you're<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
team like the bangles you're going to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.569 
team like the bangles you're going to
need<00:00:49.500> someplace<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.340> way<00:00:50.430> you're

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
need someplace to go your way you're

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.470 
need someplace to go your way you're
going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> need<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> force<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.449> turnovers

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
going to need to force some turnovers

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
going to need to force some turnovers
and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.160> gonna<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> key<00:00:53.579> part<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and I think it's gonna be a key part of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
and I think it's gonna be a key part of
this<00:00:54.059> game<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:55.020> key<00:00:55.559> while<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> Jets<00:00:56.670> okay

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
this game also key while the Jets okay

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.700 
this game also key while the Jets okay
have<00:00:57.899> um<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.489> sacked<00:01:00.480> opponents<00:01:01.140> 24

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have um you know sacked opponents 24

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.009 
have um you know sacked opponents 24
times<00:01:02.010> they've<00:01:02.699> also<00:01:02.940> led<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.480> twenty<00:01:03.840> five

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
times they've also led up twenty five

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
times they've also led up twenty five
sacks<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.159> able<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.700> stand<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
sacks so how are they able to stand up

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
sacks so how are they able to stand up
against<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.229> formidable<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:08.310> know

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is a very underrated defensive

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
is a very underrated defensive
coordinator<00:01:14.010> he's<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.939> some

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
wrinkles certainly you know the bengals

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
wrinkles certainly you know the bengals
banged<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.909> defense<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.229> know<00:01:19.350> they

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
banged up on defense but you know they

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.859 
banged up on defense but you know they
have<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> true<00:01:20.009> next<00:01:20.310> man<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.490> mentality<00:01:20.869> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
have a true next man up mentality in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
have a true next man up mentality in
that<00:01:22.110> building<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.770> defense<00:01:23.520> has

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that building and that defense has

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
that building and that defense has
really<00:01:24.150> played<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.320> year<00:01:25.680> they've<00:01:26.070> had

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
really played well this year they've had

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
really played well this year they've had
some<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.610> performances<00:01:26.820> against<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.840> good

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
some good performances against some good

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
some good performances against some good
quarterbacks<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.130> making<00:01:29.729> big<00:01:30.090> plays

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
quarterbacks I think making big plays

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.260 
quarterbacks I think making big plays
when<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.750> need<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.130> okay<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
when they need to okay and you know I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
when they need to okay and you know I
expect<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> give<00:01:34.409> Geno<00:01:34.740> Smith<00:01:35.040> fits<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
expect them to give Geno Smith fits and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
expect them to give Geno Smith fits and
now<00:01:36.270> look<00:01:36.570> both<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:37.049> teams<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:38.100> think

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
now look both these teams I don't think

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.770 
now look both these teams I don't think
are<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.579> able<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> run<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> ball<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
are going to be able to run the ball you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
are going to be able to run the ball you
have<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> Jets<00:01:40.320> average<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.430> Jets<00:01:41.670> let<00:01:41.880> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
have the Jets average the Jets let up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.109 
have the Jets average the Jets let up
about<00:01:42.630> 3.1<00:01:43.380> yards<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> carry<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.369> Cincinnati

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
about 3.1 yards a carry and Cincinnati

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
about 3.1 yards a carry and Cincinnati
only<00:01:45.360> lets<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.780> no<00:01:46.140> three<00:01:46.409> point<00:01:46.649> seven<00:01:46.890> yards

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
only lets up no three point seven yards

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940 
only lets up no three point seven yards
a<00:01:47.460> carry<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.570> look<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:48.960> tough<00:01:49.409> sledding<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
a carry so I look for tough sledding on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.410 
a carry so I look for tough sledding on
both<00:01:50.189> sides<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> ball<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:50.939> far<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.240> running

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
both sides of the ball as far as running

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
both sides of the ball as far as running
the<00:01:51.600> ball<00:01:51.780> goes<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> which<00:01:52.829> quarterback<00:01:53.220> can

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the ball goes and which quarterback can

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
the ball goes and which quarterback can
make<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> big<00:01:54.060> plays<00:01:54.329> andy<00:01:55.200> dalton<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.680> shown

because<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.550> don't<00:02:13.730> think<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.940> bunch<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.270> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
because I don't think a bunch of a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.850 
because I don't think a bunch of a
factor<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> running<00:02:15.140> game<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.590> said

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
factor in a running game like I said

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160 
factor in a running game like I said
through<00:02:16.670> those<00:02:16.819> tight<00:02:17.090> ends<00:02:17.450> play<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.020> they

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
through those tight ends play like they

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.630 
through those tight ends play like they
did<00:02:18.319> last<00:02:18.350> week<00:02:18.770> they<00:02:18.920> got<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> lot<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
did last week they got a lot of the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.130 
did last week they got a lot of the
tight<00:02:19.850> ends<00:02:20.120> last<00:02:20.330> week<00:02:20.510> how<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.930> Jets

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
tight ends last week how do the Jets

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.230 
tight ends last week how do the Jets
linebackers<00:02:21.830> matchup<00:02:22.580> against<00:02:22.850> those<00:02:23.000> tight

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
linebackers matchup against those tight

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.790 
linebackers matchup against those tight
ends<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:23.660> are<00:02:23.810> some<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.140> matchups<00:02:24.590> I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
ends these are some of the matchups I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.010 
ends these are some of the matchups I
think<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.520> look<00:02:25.760> out<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.990> I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
think you have to look out for but I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.330 
think you have to look out for but I
keep<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.380> coming<00:02:27.620> back<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.010> fact<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
keep on coming back to the fact that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.610 
keep on coming back to the fact that
outside<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.300> Atlanta<00:02:29.780> Game<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.530> know

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
outside of the Atlanta Game you know

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.800 
outside of the Atlanta Game you know
Gino<00:02:30.920> Smith<00:02:31.130> has<00:02:31.310> struggled<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.970> road<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
Gino Smith has struggled on the road and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
Gino Smith has struggled on the road and
I<00:02:33.170> think<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.709> defense<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.430> saw<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
I think this is a defense we saw the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.630 
I think this is a defense we saw the
fits<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.330> they<00:02:35.870> gave<00:02:36.110> Tom<00:02:36.500> Brady<00:02:36.890> in

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
fits that they gave Tom Brady in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.670 
fits that they gave Tom Brady in
Cincinnati<00:02:38.360> when<00:02:38.630> they<00:02:39.140> played<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:39.650> a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
Cincinnati when they played there a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.890 
Cincinnati when they played there a
couple<00:02:39.890> weeks<00:02:40.069> ago<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.730> expect<00:02:41.510> them<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.750> give

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
couple weeks ago I expect them to give

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.870 
couple weeks ago I expect them to give
Geno<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.680> know<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.890> same<00:02:43.100> kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.489> fits<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
Geno you know the same kind of fits and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.850 
Geno you know the same kind of fits and
I<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.270> where<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.690> see<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.590> lack

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
I think this is where you see the lack

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.040 
I think this is where you see the lack
of<00:02:46.100> ability<00:02:46.519> for<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:46.970> Jets<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.390> force

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
of ability for the Jets to force

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.780 
of ability for the Jets to force
turnovers<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.709> defense<00:02:49.130> really<00:02:49.430> come<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.730> a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
turnovers on defense really come to a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.930 
turnovers on defense really come to a
head<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.150> also<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.500> lack<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.769> playmakers<00:02:52.459> for

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
head and also the lack of playmakers for

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.060 
head and also the lack of playmakers for
the<00:02:53.090> Jets<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.600> offense<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:54.739> they<00:02:54.860> play

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the Jets on offense when they play

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.830 
the Jets on offense when they play
against<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.489> good<00:02:55.640> defense<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.360> think<00:02:56.810> really

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
against a good defense I think really

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.259 
against a good defense I think really
shows<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.250> think<00:02:58.550> it's<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.850> show<00:02:59.090> in

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
shows and I think it's going to show in

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.059 
shows and I think it's going to show in
this<00:02:59.390> one<00:02:59.690> I'll<00:03:00.200> worry<00:03:00.530> about<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.709> little<00:03:00.890> bit

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
this one I'll worry about a little bit

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.860 
this one I'll worry about a little bit
of<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.220> letdown<00:03:01.459> from<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.000> Jets<00:03:02.209> perspective

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
of a letdown from the Jets perspective

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.440 
of a letdown from the Jets perspective
coming<00:03:03.410> into<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.890> one<00:03:04.130> as<00:03:04.280> well<00:03:04.450> cincinnati

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
coming into this one as well cincinnati

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
at five and two looking to take a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.750 
at five and two looking to take a
stranglehold<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.780> AFC<00:03:09.410> north<00:03:09.709> as<00:03:09.950> you

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
stranglehold on that AFC north as you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.090 
stranglehold on that AFC north as you
know<00:03:10.850> Pittsburgh<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.630> Baltimore<00:03:12.100> certainly

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
know Pittsburgh and Baltimore certainly

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.009 
know Pittsburgh and Baltimore certainly
both<00:03:13.360> uncharacteristically<00:03:14.360> struggling

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
both uncharacteristically struggling

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.740

this<00:03:15.500> year<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.970> know<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.090> think<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.420> Jets<00:03:17.630> are

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
this year you know I think the Jets are

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.539 
this year you know I think the Jets are
a<00:03:17.810> much-improved<00:03:18.049> team<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.920> don't<00:03:19.100> expect<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
a much-improved team I don't expect the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.090 
a much-improved team I don't expect the
Cincinnati<00:03:20.030> offense<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.690> go<00:03:20.840> crazy<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
Cincinnati offense to go crazy in this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.100 
Cincinnati offense to go crazy in this
one<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.880> do<00:03:22.970> expect<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.540> defense<00:03:23.989> of

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
one but I do expect the defense of

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.750 
one but I do expect the defense of
Cincinnati<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.860> really<00:03:25.130> show<00:03:25.310> up<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.670> be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
Cincinnati to really show up and be

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.600 
Cincinnati to really show up and be
formidable<00:03:26.140> against<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.260> young<00:03:27.590> offense<00:03:28.400> of

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
formidable against that young offense of

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.690 
formidable against that young offense of
the<00:03:28.850> Jets<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:29.840> Cincinnati<00:03:30.470> minus<00:03:31.310> seven

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
the Jets I like Cincinnati minus seven
