00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
be a very big help later on the game

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.580 
be a very big help later on the game
because<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.209> give<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.599> supply<00:02:15.900> drops<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
because they give you supply drops and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.250 
because they give you supply drops and
they<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.480> beginning<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:18.930> trade

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
they also in the beginning will trade

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.030 
they also in the beginning will trade
for<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.790> recent<00:02:21.090> items<00:02:21.300> you've<00:02:21.800> gained<00:02:22.800> from

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
for the recent items you've gained from

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
for the recent items you've gained from
the<00:02:23.160> corner<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.520> guess<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.510> only<00:02:24.600> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the corner I guess it's not only a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.090 
the corner I guess it's not only a
cornucopia<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.650> we're<00:02:25.739> gonna<00:02:25.830> call<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
cornucopia so we're gonna call it the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.750 
cornucopia so we're gonna call it the
gyroscope<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.020> same<00:02:28.200> meaning<00:02:28.760> all

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
gyroscope but it's the same meaning all

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.220 
gyroscope but it's the same meaning all
right<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.209> guys<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.810> ahead<00:02:31.080> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
pressure plate because that'd be

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.900 
pressure plate because that'd be
cheating<00:03:34.049> that's<00:03:34.680> our<00:03:34.890> that's<00:03:35.130> also<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.820> The
