00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.740 
yeah passion fruit is a very
overwhelming<00:04:37.400> flavor<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.270> mean<00:04:38.630> that's

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
overwhelming flavor and I mean that's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.839 
overwhelming flavor and I mean that's
what<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.080> did<00:04:39.199> in<00:04:39.289> this<00:04:39.380> beer<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.710> because<00:04:40.280> the

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
what it did in this beer is because the

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.550 
what it did in this beer is because the
wheat<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.270> filtered<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.110> that<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.380> really

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
wheat was filtered and that it really

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.230 
wheat was filtered and that it really
doesn't<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.039> strong<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.610> half<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.940> bison

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240

doesn't that strong of a half of bison
or<00:04:44.330> anything<00:04:44.599> maybe<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.020> just<00:04:45.050> over<00:04:45.500> flavored

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
or anything maybe it just over flavored
