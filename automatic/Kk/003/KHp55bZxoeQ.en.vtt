00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hi everyone today 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.400
 come back to tell you about a new 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.620
 small product finally small accessory in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 actually this is an accessory that I have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
 ordered sheffield ionic and that's 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.540
 simply the new small 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
 sponge of the brand wild technics so 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 created by the sisters set you up for 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 those who follow them on youtube is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 in fact it's good I thought 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 I was going to put this little sponge in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 the test directly before your eyes 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 so you can make a story 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.990
 little comparative I decided to take 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.640
 my little sponge I had on 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 ebay that exactly the same shape as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 the one from kiko that I use from 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 from time to time for my foundation 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 liquid and that's it I thought 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.730
 was going to compare the two live for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 give you my impressions 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 so to start we'll take her out 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 its blister and so the peculiarity of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.000
 this little sponge is actually the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.980
 form as skype and on a side that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 allows to have this form enough 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.989
 particular that we do not have at all on 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 this kind depends on it so we're going 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.170
 see right away what it gives in 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 live but before I start I'll 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 immediately put water on the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.780
 sponges because what I want this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.520
 is not that matter get into 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.080
 the sponge but the slopes allow me 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.090
 to spread it on me gold if you let them 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 generally sponges will tend 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.439
 to absorb matter and on arrival 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.060
 you have all makeup foundation sponge 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.280
 and not much on the skin so 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.470
 wet hands everything everything 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.880
 very little bit, that's bored vision 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.079
 so for the test I'm going all 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.150
 simply take my foundation 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.650
 liquid from revlon the body is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.119
 simply because it's 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 generally with this background complexion 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.860
 I use my little beauty blender 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 so let's go then to start I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.070
 so let's take the flat side of 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.540
 mop it up and put a little bit of background 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.500
 of complexion on it a little bit I said and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 it's gone, so the principle is 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.070
 tap 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 to then divide the most 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.450
 uniformly possible 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.810
 so already the side is doing well 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 beveled is very convenient for the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.250
 under the eye because we arrive 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.900
 actually get closer to line 2 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:28.510
 and then mop it all up 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.970
 soft it's very nice so I'm going 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 do your side with my basic sponge 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.130
 so on this one I actually put in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.550
 two places people but on the end for 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.930
 the underside of the eye and on the back 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.930
 for the rest of the face 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.330
 so here is the finish I think you 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 go invite you I prefer ten thousand 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.209
 this time for the underside of the eye 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.610
 in fact because with this one 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.680
 finally it forces me to overflow a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.420
 little bit on the eye on the end corner 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.550
 that's still not hyper 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.930
 accurate then you can with those it 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.530
 leave your eyes open it's just 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.850
 super and more at the level of the I know 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.160
 not if you see but in fact the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.260
 plunge there she is all soft is super 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.580
 nice and even if it's all soft 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
 she puts a lot of material on the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.720
 This skin at the finish she could not 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:35.190
 absorb that my basic sponge and at 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:37.799
 level of rendering not what is certain it is 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.620
 that it's largely as good and that 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.840
 I even feel like we have a tone 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.799
 much more uniform the sides of 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.750
 those ci that on that side as if 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.769
 this one has really eaten - the products 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.120
 in fact while I said yes 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.190
 exactly the same way yeah really 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.600
 super this little sponge so to 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.480
 the finish if I had to conclude I 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.810
 would say that both sponge rather 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.359
 well 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.000
 nor talent and the product that I have 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.850
 the impression of having a rendering anyway 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.549
 a little more flawless on that side 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.200
 and that at the level of the application under 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.880
 the eye with this one is ten times more 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.690
 easy is ten times more pleasant that's it 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 really not photo 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.590
 so on arrival if only for 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.140
 the sensation of this one on the skin that 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.090
 is a lot less aggressive actually 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.550
 squarely done with that the man did not have 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.300
 need that you tap the skin then 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.030
 maybe it's good for the 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.289
 blood circulation I do not know and with 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.169
 this one you really feel 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.289
 that these sweets are sweetness 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.240
 what at the level of the underside of the eye but 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.520
 there's no picture this one ten times more 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.340
 accurate and at the rendering level so 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.820
 frankly say this if it is 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.770
 better 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.410
 so my conclusion is that this one 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.539
 rubbish and this one adopted here is it 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.860
 so you'll understand he will not get me 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.389
 did not take long to bother you 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.490
 in love with this little sponge that is 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.090
 so sweet and that's great 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.729
 his job 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.770
 if you also where had this tested 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.139
 little wonder especially do not hesitate to 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.879
 share your reviews or video in the 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.020
 comments as usual and then in 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.030
 waiting for me I send you lots of 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.210
 standards kisses and I tell you see you soon 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.919
 ciao no but no but do not mind 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.599
 but talk to them now but when 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.819
 I said trash was right in front of the 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.680
 camera what had been understood 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.550
 that's the cinema by doing no but j 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.430
 like it anyway 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.430
 I kept Thursday would be more effective
