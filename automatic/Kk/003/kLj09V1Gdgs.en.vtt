00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.320
 organic planting should be based on techniques that transform the products 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.960
 have chemical additives that have components and are efficient for 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.029
 development of the crop 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 on a ranch without tamarisk the ration offered to the herd of animals selected from 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.640
 dorper breed is 100% organic quality of production begins with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 soil preparation 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 everything starts with soil analysis 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 the ge tunnel and subsoil and the quantities biden products that we have to 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.650
 put only what he would have left for the cultures that 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.880
 will be deployed 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.430
 for example in the case of this area that what we did in the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.460
 limestone and we sampled the area after we 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 and after we had passed the limestone we planted the beans 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.780
 plant of the region 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.230
 beans after planting planted beans years ago we treated him with 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.390
 do to help land 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 then what do we do to each other? 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.390
 we plant corn 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.050
 and this corn will serve as food 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.300
 in the future 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.280
 both inature and silage, and then after about 30 days of the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 corn planted we come here plant the grass 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.830
 How are you seeing here, the wonder they escape is about 30 days? 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.230
 planted 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.540
 after having the corn 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.660
 we're going to be alone with the Tanzanian and that's where we make our system. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.060
 you are getting the start of the implantation of these two ETA members. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 these two hactares 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 From here another kick 20 or 30 days we'll do the reviews that the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.149
 little ones are usually small pickets because they do not have so much area 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.119
 after graduating you want to get out of passing the saucer to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.530
 Thank you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.720
 I was doing the rotation of pastures 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.850
 for the animal 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.110
 As soon as I passed the filet, what do we call the northeast 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.389
 10 and 12 centimeters of grass 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.329
 by aesantiago we come 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.309
 looking for alternatives to minimize 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:19.749
 cost 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.159
 with animals right then as an alternative we sought 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:30.889
 a protein bank in excellent percent and is composed of these two leguminous 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.989
 and which represent in the vignette of these animals 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.969
 the leucaena 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.859
 25% later she did nothing and the pigeon beans around 18 to 20 percent 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.269
 depending on how it is preserved it is 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.879
 with these two legumes we are attending 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.899
 nutritional needs and protein 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.899
 animals are already on the energy side, people are 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.779
 with the cost of the grasses that here in the property are 4 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:10.599
 the tanzania the rim ana its correct in a pit stop treated of all work and 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.029
 investments you have just seen 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.609
 the quality of the sns that we need to go beyond explaining 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.700
 it `s exactly 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.099
 you see all our work is all summed up 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.279
 in genetics 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.729
 animal for example here 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.529
 throughout his life 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.239
 for all the exhibitions you've been through 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.639
 he was champion in his category 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.319
 now in it has had a great effect 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.699
 in an exhibition 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.419
 now drowned in the Ingazeira where he was the great champion 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.519
 macaé such position he made a great championship with only 17 months of age 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.369
 and it's a normal rare thing 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.419
 another concern of the creator ricardo rolim wender in which he was associating 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.980
 quality of feeding 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.900
 our facilities times from the beginning we look for farms 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.389
 it's very simple 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.309
 the case of cost-benefit 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.669
 now the multifunctional 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.999
 as you can see the sex our buyers are wood ' 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:16.279
 pvc pipe sight 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.049
 we buy 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.519
 with demolition 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.519
 so the cost really is very cheap now touch 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.169
 and it has to be more important 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.120
 and for example 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.030
 drinking fountain 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.349
 he has to know which customer 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.440
 this water has to be changed 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.719
 constantly 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.419
 then surround the human with deposit system 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.480
 lots of happiness 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.259
 in exchange for water and 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.259
 two or three times a week, India also arrives 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.199
 ef 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.909
 That's the primordial ellen terça 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.789
 the sheep even playing bad bush 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.759
 he needs it mostly weighs 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.009
 So that we have no problem with game control.
