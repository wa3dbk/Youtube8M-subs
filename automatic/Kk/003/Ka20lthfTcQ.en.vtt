00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.910
 when I arrived in Rome at the age of 26 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.100
 I fell almost soon enough 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.950
 without realizing it 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.150
 in what could be called the 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:38.270
 whirlwind of worldliness but I didn't want to 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:43.900
 to be simply a mundane 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.900
 I wanted to become the king of the worldly 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.750
 I didn't want to just participate in 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.750
 feasts 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.449
 I wanted to have the power to make them fail 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.250
 started 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350
 for love 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 and all settled under the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:29.929
 chatter is noise, silence 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.969
 and feeling, emotion and fear 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:39.750
 the haggard inconstant flashes of 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:43.880
 beauty and then the wretched squalor 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.880
 and the miserable man
