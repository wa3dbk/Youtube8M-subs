00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello everyone and more hello fungus waters 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.410
 which me constantly but often 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.630
 ask about how to continue to work 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.969
 kicks that we have prepared part 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 kicks we landed and they are now 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.390
 are under the snow under the snow because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.369
 that we have outside the window minus 15 although very 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.119
 light 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 but outside the window minus 15 we are in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.980
 a greenhouse in a greenhouse plus 15 a difference of 30 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.030
 degrees it is used in winter as 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.450
 storage of any utensils working message 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.300
 from you from under the snow so what about hemp 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.600
 that's the way we have them now 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.730
 looks here were drilled holes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 tube stuck they overgrown well 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 in this way mycelium is in them 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.600
 she i hope live part of them 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.060
 was not specially covered with cellophane 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 although I always close and recommend for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.049
 bed in cellophane 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 because they so germinate better and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 overgrown more fully of course and these 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 now that are dry and not cats he is so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 Here we find out the difference how to store 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 better, I made a conclusion for myself 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 which is better in cellophane 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.979
 if they donâ€™t cost the earth if they 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 stood in the ground of course this one would 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.780
 Shura, this stump was to be harder 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.560
 because those who are in cellophane they 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 pretty weighty two times 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 heavier of course we are so in these dry it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.590
 Mitsi did not disappear or now it if 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 line up the spring on the ground he soaks himself 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 water we will water it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.610
 will take if he stood there 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.860
 winter too you would have been in ice cream 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.219
 all the moisture would be stored in it 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.800
 now just longer start though he is all 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:16.320
 infected with fungus 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:22.210
 and for interest I opened one penechki 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.370
 what experimentally does smell not 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.390
 goals are very strong just but not so 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.210
 straight flew as long as you put your nose in there 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 Well, even now you are coming from here 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.750
 inside the ice cream network is still very strong 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.210
 the smell and purpose of the mushroom that is it like 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.190
 just brought out into the street right away 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.870
 can practically give us mushrooms when 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.010
 favorable climatic course 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:53.250
 conditions outside well what else is there to show 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.290
 spent mushroom blocks in ice cream 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 of course but now if you throw them out 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.730
 the street is not now at minus 15 but when 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.790
 on the street there will be plus-night 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.910
 their temperature can already be taken out 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.790
 also cover with fresh straw grass and 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.400
 these blocks can give mushrooms yes they can't 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.940
 one hundred percent will give mushrooms but not in the same 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.380
 volume 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.709
 which they can give when we are only 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.660
 infected the first wave and smaller but it 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.470
 still a big plus and eat 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.239
 happy spring as soon 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.860
 the snow has gone 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.650
 Here is a greenhouse technology 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.030
 vegan here here we go blown 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.390
 pipes coming in here they are up to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.610
 the ceiling should be just removed now 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.989
 and takes the hot air from the top to the bottom 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.980
 laid pipe she here here 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:57.010
 divided by 3 and runs along the bottom 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:03.130
 somewhere in the depth of 40 centimeters here 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:06.459
 here here they stick out 1 for example there 2 3 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.450
 6 there should be fans from 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.880
 computer and helps additionally still 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.160
 pump warm air inside the ground 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.340
 and now he is quick to freeze 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.600
 and so also took 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.610
 that's what I wanted to say by 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.030
 hemp turning on hemp i think 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.840
 what's your question about what's in cellophane 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.380
 whether to store 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.910
 or not in cellophane I answered was for myself 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:46.570
 I determined that the figure in cellophane is better 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.570
 all all bye on this until new meetings
