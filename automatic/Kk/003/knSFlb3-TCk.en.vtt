 the portal is also numbered and quite 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.789
 easy to put in place 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.930

 installation portal all the slots filled 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 mineral wool padded foil 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.460
 it just remains to install the portal 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.190
 We start the installation of the quarter from the side 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:52.790
 wall mounting side wall 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.980
 insert the front wall 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.050

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.050
 became exactly if not go not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.090
 will be the second side wall and the second 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.400
 facial 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.300
 quarter is established quickly and not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300
 requires no effort 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.439
 we have 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 the first tier of the portal is ready to install 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 fastening aluminum bracket 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.070
 power brackets together neatly 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 set shelf portal on this 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 the shelf can put something in 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.380
 further 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 while connected to the top 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.030
 Quarter regular aluminum bracket 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.710
 braces allow the quarter to be tough and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.710
 keep well in a niche 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 here are literally six more stones and the top 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.180
 part of the portal is ready to install 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.440
 closing design and installation 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 top shelf 2 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.200
 not 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.000
 put the top staples together 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.790
 small enough opening is needed 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.269
 gently try to insert the top 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.340
 Shelf she carries and decorative properties 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.760
 also closes the design into a single 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.760
 whole 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.250
 after the portal is assembled around 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160
 Quarter very tightly stuffed 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.260
 basalt cotton wool cotton wool 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.020
 used special on infinitely 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.870
 phenolic binders it all actually 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:25.250
 just ground basalt there and complicated 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:30.040
 and painstaking operation is when drilling 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.720
 decorative frame then the frame hides 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.680
 connection oven with the portal and makes drinking 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680
 more accurate 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.790
 Since the frame is put on dress 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.330
 the cast-iron door is now ready for 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.330
 I use 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.730
 after installing the portal it remains to nail 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.709
 only trim it will make the owner 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 self trim will hide 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.560
 touches of the wooden wall portal 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.709
 won't become 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.800
 once again we light the stove
