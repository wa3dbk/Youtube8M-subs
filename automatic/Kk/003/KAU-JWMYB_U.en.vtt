yesterday it's the car ready to race
this<00:03:26.020> afternoon

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
this afternoon

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.170 
this afternoon
the<00:03:26.710> cars<00:03:26.890> ready<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.250> race<00:03:27.400> fortunately<00:03:28.030> we

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the cars ready to race fortunately we

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060 
the cars ready to race fortunately we
hit<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.420> tyre<00:03:28.600> wall<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.050> turn<00:03:29.620> eight<00:03:29.830> but<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
hit the tyre wall in turn eight but the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.790 
hit the tyre wall in turn eight but the
suspension<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.930> not<00:03:32.140> touched<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> back

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
suspension was not touched in the back

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.850 
suspension was not touched in the back
so<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.490> is<00:03:33.550> what<00:03:33.790> made<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:33.970> easier<00:03:34.390> for<00:03:34.420> us

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
so this is what made it easier for us

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.040 
so this is what made it easier for us
basically<00:03:35.860> we<00:03:36.070> hit<00:03:36.360> rear-end<00:03:37.360> first<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.960> then

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
basically we hit rear-end first and then

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.750 
basically we hit rear-end first and then
the<00:03:38.140> cars<00:03:38.320> time<00:03:38.530> we<00:03:38.650> did<00:03:38.800> our<00:03:38.980> wall<00:03:39.220> sideways

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the cars time we did our wall sideways

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.699 
the cars time we did our wall sideways
so<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.240> what<00:03:40.390> we<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> bit<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.020> body

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.270 
so this is what we have a bit of body

that<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.459> have<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.760> do<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> homemade<00:03:58.600> tail<00:03:59.260> lamp

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
that we have to do a homemade tail lamp

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.620 
that we have to do a homemade tail lamp
and<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.430> rest<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> car<00:04:00.970> straight<00:04:01.300> we<00:04:01.480> put

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
and the rest of the car straight we put

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.050 
and the rest of the car straight we put
it<00:04:01.720> on<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> scales<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.410> nothing<00:04:02.770> was<00:04:02.950> out<00:04:03.520> of

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
it on the scales and nothing was out of

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.300 
it on the scales and nothing was out of
alignment<00:04:04.420> or<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.290> weight<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:05.950> guess

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
alignment or out of weight so I guess

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.860 
alignment or out of weight so I guess
