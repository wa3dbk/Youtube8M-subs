00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.719
 who thinks that the concept of compact cars for the urban environment is a 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.100
 Recent phenomenon is very much mistaken. 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.480
 inclusion as a pinch was already a long time ago says it is an example that 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.320
 existed in Brazil was the right romi to know more about the history of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 nice model 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.219
 with very striking characteristics these carts were born in Germany in the 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.490
 late 40's say 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.790
 nevertheless the model gained the heart of the Brazilian years later 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.160
 thanks to the production of a national version of the cart 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.910
 coexistence this because the manufacturing was in charge of the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.310
 so between 1956 and 1961, about three thousand models were produced 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.880
 with visits in Brazil was successful mainly in the artistic medium will be 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.740
 trained in italy 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.480
 the population of the northeast and drought 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.220
 he ended up being 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.560
 but we know what the seeds are like 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.480
 with technological concepts of aviation want dynamic advanced models 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.980
 they will tell me that until today it has a lot of style 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.480
 mounted with tubular chassis that taper into the rear gauge shaft 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.940
 front wheels with independent springs and with only 220 5 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 inches long has a great differential of being very easy 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.180
 of parking a highly valued feature nowadays 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.680
 the first are offal were equipped with two-cylinder engines 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.670
 which was later replaced by the model manufactured by bmw 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.590
 of only one cylinder and four tries originally created for motorcycles 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.930
 with two hundred and ninety-eight displacements and 13 horsepower 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.650
 so much that it brings under the bench matone came as in the deaths and how has the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.580
 3 liter fuel tank in the fuel tank with 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.209
 3 thousand liters 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.530
 the transmission is made by two chains that carry the force of the motor 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.099
 the rear wheels 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.799
 causing the movement to reach the maximum speed of 85 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.619
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:25.159
 a man who had the rounded shape so he earned the nickname of a cowboy 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.500
 day 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.800
 but the most striking feature of the event is that it led to the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.930
 direction in the previous phase universal consultations in the background and for 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 open the door of the neighboring apartment 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.829
 whoever we do not know and charming 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.790
 in the late 1950s homicides became a sensation in the streets and 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.059
 Brazilian roads but until today it has sighs wherever it goes
