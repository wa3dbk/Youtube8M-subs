00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
veneers to add to the stress utilizing

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.130 
veneers to add to the stress utilizing
the<00:00:37.550> tack<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:37.970> wave<00:00:38.150> segmentation<00:00:38.840> as<00:00:38.960> you'll

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
the tack and wave segmentation as you'll

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.800 
the tack and wave segmentation as you'll
see<00:00:39.760> eliminates<00:00:40.760> most<00:00:41.090> of<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:41.420> stress<00:00:41.780> and

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
see eliminates most of that stress and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.210 
see eliminates most of that stress and
makes<00:00:42.080> it<00:00:42.200> very<00:00:42.260> efficient<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.750> enjoyable
