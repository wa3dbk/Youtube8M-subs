00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.170
 hello to you all my cable 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.000
 today we talk about yak-9 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.430
 salute ambiguous not long ago I wanted to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.890
 he looked at my game to take out his 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.780
 the verdict of the plane we have beautiful on 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.200
 beautiful planes as we know very much 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.570
 often belong to the class of garage and not 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 stand a mace we will stop by to look 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.890
 on them you breathe 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 leave there stuck to ride them in 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.680
 test pour 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.880
 as far as our games soar, I 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.250
 decided to limp while chasing all the doors 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.370
 2500 somewhere so amulets entered into me 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.100
 Klim certainly canceled because they shot 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.160
 fakirs and I realized that there is nothing to catch 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.810
 in principle, well, if there is nothing for us there 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.500
 catch it is necessary to produce some 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.720
 tactics 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.700
 and what to develop tactics need to understand 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.940
 that we generally can not that we do not 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.120
 we can flat run as 720 for 7 acres 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.120
 about plus or minus 20 kilometers we 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.479
 we can even handle ourselves and we will leave 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 ok without losing wings that is 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.180
 structural stability 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.729
 good of minuses at 400 450 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.450
 getting out of a dive is already getting 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.500
 problem 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 so be careful with the manners of what else 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.430
 we have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.900
 we have good weapons here i 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 flying with two 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.560
 with three gun up to 20 and that's not bad in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 principle for fighters but for beavers 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 It is advisable to put 30 metal families 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 cannon Rome I already punish in principle 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.350
 you can apologize if you like 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 shoot down the ballistics there of course 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.000
 peculiar on the vertical we ourselves not 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830
 feel bad on the vertical of the earth but 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.980
 the higher we climb the worse we are 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 it becomes generally understandable why 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.239
 soviet planes like they are not now 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 ice is not all but many well anyway 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.580
 so historically it was though 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.530
 historic our plane imagine 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.160
 myself in a demonstration battle cancer at the height 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.940
 from two to three thousand kilometers product 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.739
 meters exactly vertical did keen 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 color afraid 31 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.160
 and the truth spoke to her and express on that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.480
 same height 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.519
 so here they are definitely information 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 the salute itself was let's say 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.300
 temporary and replacement of obsolete aircraft 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.860
 20 metal and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.450
 could have been sticking out the terms abbot 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.210
 May retrain pilots who 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.520
 flew multiple as here of course 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.830
 the same problems did not make us easy 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.900
 more or less normal aircraft with 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.310
 combat pilots 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.780
 case of war, you know with whom they 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.430
 met pampers are you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.570
 griffon in normal condition 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 since we have a game of golden eagle and stuff 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.520
 other other spitphera nine same 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.820
 most queens are not only nines in general 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.780
 we had a problem though the plane was fighting 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.640
 at altitudes up to 7000 meters you say that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.340
 in general, he is all there at night is not bad 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.560
 felt and over 7 already started 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.500
 problems of our game is not implemented 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.200
 so we will not think about it 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.580
 what else can you say about the plane 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.340
 horizontals in the probe in the reference form 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.430
 the plane is about 500 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.130
 66 maximum with afterburner kilometer per hour 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.480
 Well, you know, for wretchedness, what to do 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.680
 will be the real world he did not think he was going 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.860
 about 500 70 580 lands and 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.239
 at an altitude of 660 670 if I am not mistaken it 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.359
 so well, again, not implemented 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:24.230
 what to do considering everything said that 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.560
 well do let's take it take 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.530
 the basis is the fact that the plane is with us 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 Fits better for an aircraft which 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.310
 will assist 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.169
 I didn't help 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.540
 we will face them up I will tie 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.190
 enter below to drive the enemy from the heights 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:46.750
 we will be on the sidelines and we will 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.100
 all the time to help that is scored 34 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.860
 thousands of meters and calm 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.140
 waiting and when the battle will move all 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.650
 below below and when the battle is already on 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.680
 our network or below we will help 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.530
 potter 720 and we dive boldly allocate 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.780
 kills weapons can be put on your 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.980
 taste for fighter again I repeat 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.280
 ideally three d 20 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.260
 Here you see the actual picture 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.120
 speed on starts to melt i go with 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.720
 afterburner unfortunately I do not catch up 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.630
 catching up 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.940
 worth it and there's nothing you can do well kulay 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.860
 here somehow support plane boldly 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.150
 let's call him yes we can quite well 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.420
 by the way 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.700
 engine death could begin with happiness 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.880
 It is treated quite quickly turnover choose 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.010
 a0 short-term we stand for 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.640
 as I said, and we can very well 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.490
 played 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.850
 can the speaker he not catch up with someone more 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.770
 why don't we need to climb up 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:59.300
 our work is such a series of cakes 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.970
 the plane in real life was not so good 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.340
 how could it seem but he was on 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.500
 involve and in general and on it 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:12.140
 preparing Japan is such a car was 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.540
 solve the site of the wedge and on this review 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.650
 coming to an end all clear skies and 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.740
 Have a good mood 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.530
 fly black rose with you 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.180
 Soviet court and do it wisely 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.340
 and copy them too amount 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.340
 Bye bye bye
