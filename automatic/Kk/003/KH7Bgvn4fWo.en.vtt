first<00:05:15.879> I<00:05:16.029> noticed<00:05:16.360> maybe<00:05:16.509> we<00:05:16.750> could<00:05:16.900> close

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
first I noticed maybe we could close

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.760 
first I noticed maybe we could close
with<00:05:17.289> that<00:05:17.319> is<00:05:17.529> the<00:05:17.680> unique<00:05:18.129> form<00:05:19.029> factor<00:05:19.449> that

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
with that is the unique form factor that

with that is the unique form factor that
absolute<00:05:20.770> tablet<00:05:21.099> s<00:05:21.219> house<00:05:21.509> absolutely<00:05:22.509> so

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
absolute tablet s house absolutely so

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.890 
absolute tablet s house absolutely so
for<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.400> taking<00:05:24.669> some<00:05:24.879> good<00:05:25.089> pics<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.479> it<00:05:25.659> it

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
for to taking some good pics on it it

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.869 
for to taking some good pics on it it
has<00:05:26.139> a<00:05:27.360> off<00:05:28.360> center<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.080> gravity<00:05:29.560> type<00:05:29.919> folded

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
has a off center of gravity type folded

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.640 
has a off center of gravity type folded
design<00:05:32.129> so<00:05:33.129> allows<00:05:33.699> isn't<00:05:34.300> very<00:05:34.449> ergonomic<00:05:35.110> so

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
design so allows isn't very ergonomic so

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.189 
design so allows isn't very ergonomic so
the<00:05:36.520> idea<00:05:36.639> is<00:05:36.909> you<00:05:37.029> be<00:05:37.270> able<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.629> hold<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.080> with

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
the idea is you be able to hold it with

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.899 
the idea is you be able to hold it with
one<00:05:38.229> hand<00:05:38.469> comfortably<00:05:39.000> like<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.029> book

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
ambidextrous so if you left or right

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.429 
ambidextrous so if you left or right
handed<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.550> have<00:05:46.029> allowed<00:05:46.539> to<00:05:46.839> just<00:05:47.229> to

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439
