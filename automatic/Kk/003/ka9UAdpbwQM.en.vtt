00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
in this case with Jack there are mostly
more<00:02:25.410> than<00:02:25.590> 10<00:02:25.860> cards<00:02:26.190> removed<00:02:26.430> from<00:02:26.580> place<00:02:26.819> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
more than 10 cards removed from place so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
more than 10 cards removed from place so
yeah<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.569> has<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:28.170> than<00:02:28.349> 4000<00:02:28.920> attack<00:02:29.040> points

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
yeah it has more than 4000 attack points

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.640 
yeah it has more than 4000 attack points
so<00:02:29.849> pretty<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:31.519> pretty<00:02:32.519> much<00:02:33.140> for<00:02:34.140> an<00:02:34.260> 11-3

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so pretty much pretty much for an 11-3

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.670 
so pretty much pretty much for an 11-3

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
dimensional capsule so it's good and I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.350 
dimensional capsule so it's good and I
run<00:03:15.030> free<00:03:15.269> copies<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.660> it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.660
