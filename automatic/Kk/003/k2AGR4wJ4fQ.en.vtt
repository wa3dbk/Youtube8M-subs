going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.070> show<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.250> how<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:14.730> some<00:00:14.910> space

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
going to show you how we did some space

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
going to show you how we did some space
planning<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.780> our<00:00:15.900> basement<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.680> figure

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
planning for our basement as we figure

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.859 
planning for our basement as we figure
out<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.609> some<00:00:17.820> storage<00:00:18.090> solutions<00:00:18.690> in

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
out how to get some storage solutions in

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.599 
out how to get some storage solutions in
there<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> show<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.310> because

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
there I'm going to show you not because

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
there I'm going to show you not because
sherry<00:00:20.820> wasn't<00:00:21.150> part<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> process<00:00:21.900> but

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
sherry wasn't part of the process but

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
sherry wasn't part of the process but
because<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> involves<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:23.580> math<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.150> am

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
because it involves some math and I am

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
because it involves some math and I am
certainly<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> math<00:00:25.500> ear<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.189> us

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
certainly the math ear of the two of us

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.980 
certainly the math ear of the two of us
despite<00:00:27.060> Sherry's<00:00:27.390> dad<00:00:27.599> being<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> math

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
despite Sherry's dad being a math

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
despite Sherry's dad being a math
teacher<00:00:28.490> yes<00:00:29.490> Anne<00:00:29.670> involves<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.060> graph

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
teacher yes Anne involves some graph

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.569 
teacher yes Anne involves some graph
paper<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.720> decided<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.260> low-tech<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.040> use

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
paper we decided to go low-tech and use

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
paper we decided to go low-tech and use
this<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> create<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.540> scale<00:00:33.840> drawing<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
this to create a two scale drawing of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
this to create a two scale drawing of
our<00:00:35.010> basement<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.880> figure<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.090> how

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
our basement so we can figure out how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
our basement so we can figure out how
the<00:00:36.329> furniture<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> storage<00:00:37.440> solutions

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the furniture and the storage solutions

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
the furniture and the storage solutions
we're<00:00:38.070> considering<00:00:38.399> would<00:00:38.700> actually<00:00:38.940> fit<00:00:39.120> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we're considering would actually fit in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
we're considering would actually fit in
there<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.540> took<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> graph<00:00:40.500> paper<00:00:40.680> downstairs

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
there so took the graph paper downstairs

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.889 
there so took the graph paper downstairs
to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.820> basement<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.600> measuring<00:00:42.840> tape

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to the basement with my measuring tape

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
to the basement with my measuring tape
and<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.800> pen<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.579> basically<00:00:44.879> measured

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and a pen and basically measured

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
and a pen and basically measured
everything<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> could<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:46.890> draw

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
everything out so that I could then draw

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
everything out so that I could then draw
to<00:00:47.640> scale<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.660> sheet<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> paper<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to scale on this sheet of paper I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
to scale on this sheet of paper I
decided<00:00:50.280> each<00:00:50.610> square<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> six<00:00:51.840> inches

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
decided each square would be six inches

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
decided each square would be six inches
because<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.440> figured<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.920> easiest<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
because I figured that was easiest and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.040 
because I figured that was easiest and
after<00:00:54.059> doing<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.360> having<00:00:54.660> some<00:00:54.809> fun<00:00:54.930> with

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
after doing that having some fun with

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.880 
after doing that having some fun with
some<00:00:55.230> markers<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.239> ended<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
some markers I ended up here this is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.959 
some markers I ended up here this is
sort<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> basement<00:00:59.609> looks<00:00:59.760> like

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
sort of what the basement looks like

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
sort of what the basement looks like
here's<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> door<00:01:00.890> here's<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.980> fugly<00:01:02.219> water

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here's the door here's that fugly water

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
here's the door here's that fugly water
heater<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> couple<00:01:03.180> windows<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.229> from<00:01:04.860> here

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
heater a couple windows and from here

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.050 
heater a couple windows and from here
basically<00:01:05.850> wanted<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.470> create<00:01:07.610> paper<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
basically wanted to create paper to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.520 
basically wanted to create paper to
represent<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> objects<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.350> might

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
represent all the objects that we might

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
represent all the objects that we might
bring<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> different<00:01:11.340> furniture<00:01:11.540> we

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
bring in all the different furniture we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.429 
bring in all the different furniture we
decided<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.930> we're<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> use

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
decided that we're going to use

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
decided that we're going to use
furniture<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.979> Ikea<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.880> they've<00:01:15.030> got

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
furniture from Ikea because they've got

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
furniture from Ikea because they've got
lots<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> different<00:01:15.600> options<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.259> shelving

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lots of different options for shelving

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310
