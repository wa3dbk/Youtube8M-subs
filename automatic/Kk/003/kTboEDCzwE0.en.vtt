not damage to packaging so that wasn't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
without too many dramas so I'm going to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.270 
without too many dramas so I'm going to
push<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.710> over<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.900> slide<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:21.890> out<00:02:22.100> this

push that over and slide this out this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.910 
push that over and slide this out this
way<00:02:24.580> okay<00:02:25.580> let's<00:02:25.760> try<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.880> again

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.059

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
that wasn't too bad so you can see that

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.300 
that wasn't too bad so you can see that
it's<00:02:34.190> stuck<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.959> vista<00:02:35.959> we're<00:02:36.470> good<00:02:36.950> plastic

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
not as flexible but I do move a little

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:40.540 
not as flexible but I do move a little
bit

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
bit

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.430

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that's pretty much the move ability of

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.170 
that's pretty much the move ability of
the<00:04:48.919> figure<00:04:49.190> now<00:04:51.550> I'm<00:04:52.550> going<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.880> show<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.090> how

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
the figure now I'm going to show you how

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.060 
the figure now I'm going to show you how
to<00:04:53.240> put<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.510> together<00:04:53.660> because<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.590> can't<00:04:54.830> be<00:04:55.039> a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
to put it together because it can't be a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.490 
to put it together because it can't be a
bit<00:04:55.340> tricky<00:04:55.820> see<00:04:56.510> if<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.660> get<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.840> arms<00:04:57.380> in

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
bit tricky see if you get the arms in

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.080 
bit tricky see if you get the arms in
the<00:04:57.560> back<00:04:57.590> back<00:04:57.979> into<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.280> position<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.699> this

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
the back back into a position like this

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.120 
the back back into a position like this
you<00:04:59.990> can<00:05:00.310> easily<00:05:01.310> push<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.270> in<00:05:02.419> together

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
you can easily push it in together

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.029 
you can easily push it in together
relatively<00:05:04.130> easy<00:05:04.460> with<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:05.000> bit<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.300> force<00:05:06.039> just

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
relatively easy with a bit of force just

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.100 
relatively easy with a bit of force just
like<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:08.590> should<00:05:09.590> sit<00:05:09.949> in<00:05:10.070> really<00:05:10.729> well

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
like this and should sit in really well

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.529 
like this and should sit in really well
with<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:12.440> with<00:05:13.430> what<00:05:13.610> I've<00:05:13.699> done<00:05:13.729> here<00:05:14.240> I'll

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
with this with what I've done here I'll

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.969 
with this with what I've done here I'll
pull<00:05:14.750> should<00:05:14.990> have<00:05:15.370> fixed<00:05:16.370> up<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.729> little<00:05:16.970> bit

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
pull should have fixed up a little bit

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.460 
pull should have fixed up a little bit
but<00:05:18.979> in<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:19.430> next<00:05:19.669> shot

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
but in this next shot

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.320 
but in this next shot
so<00:05:22.040> that's<00:05:22.190> what<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.370> looks<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.180> I'm
