hello warhammer 40k gaming community

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.700 
hello warhammer 40k gaming community
this<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.580> my<00:00:05.660> Imperial<00:00:06.660> Guard<00:00:06.899> destroying

this is my Imperial Guard destroying

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
this is my Imperial Guard destroying
firstborn<00:00:09.349> infantry<00:00:10.349> division<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:12.450> would

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
firstborn infantry division this would

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.269 
firstborn infantry division this would
be<00:00:13.610> my<00:00:14.660> commanding<00:00:15.660> officer<00:00:16.010> with<00:00:17.010> power

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
be my commanding officer with power

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.170 
be my commanding officer with power
sword<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.890> then<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.600> have<00:00:22.010> two<00:00:23.010> heavy<00:00:23.310> flavors

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
sword and then I have two heavy flavors

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
sword and then I have two heavy flavors
as<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:26.000> I<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.650> two<00:00:28.650> heavy

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
as you can see here I have two heavy

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
as you can see here I have two heavy
bolters<00:00:29.510> which<00:00:30.510> come<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> firstborn

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
bolters which come with the firstborn

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.060 
bolters which come with the firstborn
pack<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.329> then<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> last<00:00:34.260> cannon<00:00:34.770> team

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
pack and then I got a last cannon team

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.170 
pack and then I got a last cannon team
and<00:00:37.100> tons<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.370> infantry<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.750> sergeants

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
and tons of infantry and two sergeants

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.900 
and tons of infantry and two sergeants
now<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> only<00:00:42.840> problem<00:00:43.020> I've<00:00:43.559> had<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:44.190> these

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
now the only problem I've had with these

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.369 
now the only problem I've had with these
figures<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.280> metal

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
figures would be that they're metal

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.639 
figures would be that they're metal
because<00:00:49.850> for<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.059> they're<00:00:51.539> insanely<00:00:51.960> hard<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because for one they're insanely hard to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.650 
because for one they're insanely hard to
put<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> pedestal<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.629> can

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
put in the pedestal because as you can

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.200 
put in the pedestal because as you can
see<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:56.460> put<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> pedestal<00:00:58.160> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
see you put them in the pedestal and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
see you put them in the pedestal and
then<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.230> push<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:01.829> into

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
then to you have to push them down into

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.109 
then to you have to push them down into
it<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.400> they<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.729> stick<00:01:07.130> which<00:01:08.130> hurts<00:01:08.729> your

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it so they will stick which hurts your

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.070 
it so they will stick which hurts your
hands<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.490> would<00:01:11.490> suggest<00:01:11.970> getting<00:01:12.450> kadian

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
hands so I would suggest getting kadian

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.960 
hands so I would suggest getting kadian
forces<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:15.210> new<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> starting<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.500> at

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
forces if you're new and starting out at

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
forces if you're new and starting out at
warhammer<00:01:17.970> 40k<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:21.740> that's<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:24.799> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
warhammer 40k and that's about it so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.480 
warhammer 40k and that's about it so
yeah<00:01:26.250> oh<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.710> another<00:01:28.710> bad<00:01:29.040> thing<00:01:29.070> about

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
yeah oh and another bad thing about

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.499 
yeah oh and another bad thing about
these<00:01:29.820> pedal<00:01:30.180> figures<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:32.509> when

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
these pedal figures as you can see when

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
these pedal figures as you can see when
trying<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> put<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> pedestal

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
trying to put this one on this pedestal

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.149 
trying to put this one on this pedestal
it<00:01:35.790> been<00:01:36.210> off<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:39.329> had<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> end<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.320> gluing

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it been off and I had to end up gluing

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.020 
it been off and I had to end up gluing
it<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:42.470> with<00:01:43.640> hot<00:01:44.640> glue<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it on with hot glue so that's one of the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.190 
it on with hot glue so that's one of the
downsides<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:49.590> getting<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> firstborn<00:01:50.430> squad

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
downsides to getting the firstborn squad

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.100 
downsides to getting the firstborn squad
and<00:01:53.270> that's<00:01:54.270> pretty<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:56.810> think<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> did

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and that's pretty much it I think I did

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.859 
and that's pretty much it I think I did
some<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.649> good<00:01:58.890> work<00:01:59.610> except<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
some pretty good work except for the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
some pretty good work except for the
only<00:02:01.049> problem<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> had<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:02.040> glue<00:02:02.670> showing

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
only problem I had was glue showing

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.990 
only problem I had was glue showing
right<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:04.680> otherwise<00:02:04.950> yep<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
right there but otherwise yep them it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
right there but otherwise yep them it
looks<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.409> hot<00:02:08.129> glue<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:10.560> had

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
looks pretty good for hot glue and I had

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.550 
looks pretty good for hot glue and I had
a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.770 
a
how<00:02:12.160> cool<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.489> guy's<00:02:12.819> arm<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:15.569> how<00:02:16.569> cool

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
how cool that guy's arm on and how cool

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.300 
how cool that guy's arm on and how cool
that<00:02:16.810> guy<00:02:17.110> down<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.260> suggest<00:02:20.980> Katie

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
that guy down so I suggest Katie

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.760 
that guy down so I suggest Katie
enforces<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.780> you're<00:02:23.050> starting<00:02:23.349> out<00:02:23.440> because

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
enforces if you're starting out because

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.940 
enforces if you're starting out because
they're<00:02:24.040> easier<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> bud<00:02:25.690> together<00:02:27.330> unlike

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
they're easier to bud together unlike

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.509 
they're easier to bud together unlike
these<00:02:29.950> guys<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.930> had<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.530> glue<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.280> gun<00:02:33.489> on

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
these guys you had to glue the gun on

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.720 
these guys you had to glue the gun on
and<00:02:35.700> glue<00:02:36.700> him<00:02:36.940> into<00:02:37.180> place<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.730> glue

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and glue him into place and then glue

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.729 
and glue him into place and then glue
that<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.150> place<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.959> then<00:02:41.080> glue<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> spotter

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
that on place and then glue the spotter

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.080 
that on place and then glue the spotter
on<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.099> place<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:44.220> indeed<00:02:45.220> highly

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
on the place so I indeed highly

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.770 
on the place so I indeed highly
recommend<00:02:46.540> kadian<00:02:46.989> horses<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.600> want

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
recommend kadian horses but if you want

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.920 
recommend kadian horses but if you want
some<00:02:50.080> pizzazz<00:02:50.850> for<00:02:51.850> your<00:02:52.060> fighting<00:02:52.360> force<00:02:52.600> I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
some pizzazz for your fighting force I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.070 
some pizzazz for your fighting force I
would<00:02:53.290> suggest<00:02:53.530> getting<00:02:54.209> historian's<00:02:55.209> just

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
would suggest getting historian's just

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.949 
would suggest getting historian's just
the<00:02:56.200> fact<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:58.450> look<00:02:58.840> very<00:02:59.610> awesome

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the fact that they look very awesome

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.440 
the fact that they look very awesome
with<00:03:01.959> their<00:03:02.140> gas<00:03:02.349> masks<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.280> Russian<00:03:03.940> outfits

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
with their gas masks and Russian outfits

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.809 
with their gas masks and Russian outfits
and<00:03:04.780> crap<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:09.330> there<00:03:10.330> are<00:03:10.510> metal<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.819> you

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and crap and that there are metal so you

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.820
