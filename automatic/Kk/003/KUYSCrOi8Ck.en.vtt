climbed several times without oxygen

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.109 
climbed several times without oxygen
mm-hmm<00:01:35.050> so<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:36.070> precedent<00:01:36.610> has<00:01:36.700> already<00:01:37.000> been

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
mm-hmm so the precedent has already been

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.359 
mm-hmm so the precedent has already been
set<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.840> way<00:01:38.049> right<00:01:38.500> it's<00:01:38.740> actually<00:01:38.950> been
