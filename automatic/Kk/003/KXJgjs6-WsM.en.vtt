00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hard to believe that the original rock of the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.030
 ddr rock music always after 45 years 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.440
 still on the stage is the speech is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 Of course, from the puhdys in december 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.550
 In 2013 they started their third 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 winterthur after december wearing and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.220
 december nights thrilled them this time 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.320
 with holy nights we had in advance the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 possibility with two band members too 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 speak and of course wanted to know 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:36.200
 how to do it 45 years together, we can stand 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.200
 just stay together 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.570
 we all know that they all know each other 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 want to stay together and there 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 works is not so often 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.700
 as I said, we have since then a couple 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 tricks we do not drive, for example 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 together in the car or we do not drive 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.070
 vacation together 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 we do not go shopping together and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 do not keep us as possible 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.649
 By doing so you get serious with each other 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.649
 up to 100 years 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.450
 what is the idea for them? 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.770
 Christmas concerts were created 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 I have to learn that the sacred 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.850
 nights go until the middle of January and ours 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.170
 tour goes until the middle of january 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 I really would like it if I did 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.729
 to decide alone was unfortunately 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.229
 i called it december but i dream 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 believe the idea with the holy nights 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.490
 It's a great idea no matter who had her 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 and we remain as holy as we are 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.490
 our heat with the goods has always been 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.700
 even with december days were ours 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.460
 Children with at all Christmas concerts 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.690
 or winter concerts was a label 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.320
 with and they are now 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:00.310
 a bit higher for example with 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.380
 this machine the granddaughter yes so 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.060
 we already had this kind of this 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.910
 We already had a constellation 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 at the two Christmas at the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.840
 Christmas tours and that has become 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.610
 proven 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 Maybe someday it would be like that again 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.090
 make a winter or Christmas tour 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.830
 where they are all together was the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.660
 very small that only build meanwhile 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.660
 who have already grown up 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 we are practically roger entner 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.079
 makes it a lot of fun 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.860
 as a retiree through the area no one 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.070
 supposed 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.260
 but we are one-legged and traveling 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.900
 that's good 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.880
 in the filled with about 1600 visitors 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.670
 zwickauer stadthalle came from the first 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.310
 sound to a great mood next to 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.290
 machine alias dieter brÃ¶er convinced 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.640
 This time, above all, Dieter Dieter 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 Tremendous with his charismatic 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 voice 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 No 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.980
 Later he was also with his 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.960
 15 year old daughter kimberly to hear 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.390
 next to Christmas songs were allowed at the end 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.550
 Of course, the classics like that too 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.750
 her melanie or when a human lives 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.120
 not missing 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.490
 So you can be curious what you can 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.850
 expect this in the near future 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.850
 may
