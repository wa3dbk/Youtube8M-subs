just<00:02:19.090> perfect<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.870> had<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.140> play<00:02:20.319> against

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.949 
just perfect and I had to play against
people<00:02:21.489> using<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.180> know<00:02:22.300> juggernaut<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
people using you know juggernaut and

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.470 
people using you know juggernaut and
last<00:02:23.410> stand<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:23.950> made<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> worse<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.420> I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
last stand so that made it worse but I

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.540 
last stand so that made it worse but I
keep<00:02:25.720> forgetting<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.200> zooming<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.099> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
keep forgetting that zooming in on the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.640 
keep forgetting that zooming in on the
shotgun<00:02:27.760> looking<00:02:28.300> down<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.599> side<00:02:28.840> actually

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
shotgun looking down the side actually

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.050 
shotgun looking down the side actually
makes<00:02:29.800> things<00:02:30.010> worse<00:02:30.220> because<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.640> makes<00:02:30.819> this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
makes things worse because it makes this

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.710 
makes things worse because it makes this
spread<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.630> heard<00:02:32.940> wider<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.480> actually

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
spread so I heard wider so it's actually

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.330 
spread so I heard wider so it's actually
actually<00:02:35.440> worse<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.130> aim<00:02:36.310> down

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
actually worse for you if you aim down

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.990 
actually worse for you if you aim down
side<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.709> difference<00:02:39.160> being<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.610> one

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
side and that difference being and one

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.030 
side and that difference being and one
more<00:02:40.209> for<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.569> when<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.230> end<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.500> aim<00:02:41.680> down<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
more for to when you end up aim down the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.600 
more for to when you end up aim down the
side<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.430> actually<00:02:42.550> better<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.300> your<00:02:44.610> put

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
side it's actually better for your put

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.600 
side it's actually better for your put
your<00:02:45.670> shotgun<00:02:46.150> blast<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:47.560> kill<00:02:47.890> but

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
your shotgun blast so you will kill but

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.009 
your shotgun blast so you will kill but
not<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:48.970> one<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.540> one<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.959> think

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
not in this one not in this one I think

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.130 
not in this one not in this one I think
it<00:02:50.290> reduces<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.830> range<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> actually

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it reduces the range and actually

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.930 
it reduces the range and actually
spreads<00:02:53.140> makes<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.769> spread<00:02:54.100> wider<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.790> not

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
spreads makes the spread wider I'm not

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.370 
spreads makes the spread wider I'm not
sure<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> pick<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.810> minions<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> would

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
sure but I pick up a minions you would

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.050

warfare<00:03:30.100> 2<00:03:30.280> actually<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> most

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
warfare 2 actually this is the most

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.539

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
would think why next to the scorpion

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.539 
would think why next to the scorpion
because<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:37.450> menu<00:03:37.660> Z<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.930> powerful<00:03:38.549> it's

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549
