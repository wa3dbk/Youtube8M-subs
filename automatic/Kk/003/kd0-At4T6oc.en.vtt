00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.290 
about the adaptive cruise control that
comes<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.140> many<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.620> cars<00:00:07.890> these<00:00:08.099> days<00:00:08.300> we

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
talk to you about this cruise control so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.099 
talk to you about this cruise control so
first<00:00:24.240> thing<00:00:24.330> we're<00:00:24.449> gonna<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.689> set<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
first thing we're gonna do is set the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
first thing we're gonna do is set the
cruise<00:00:25.289> control<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.939> would<00:00:27.090> normally<00:00:27.240> set

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
cruise control as you would normally set

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.060 
cruise control as you would normally set
the<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:27.810> cruise<00:00:27.960> control<00:00:28.289> adaptive<00:00:28.980> cruise

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the new cruise control adaptive cruise

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
the new cruise control adaptive cruise
control<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.550> those<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:30.029> know<00:00:30.179> just

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
control for those you don't know just

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.209 
control for those you don't know just
maintains<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.260> safe<00:00:31.439> distance<00:00:31.650> between<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
maintains a safe distance between the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
maintains a safe distance between the
car<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.430> front<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.390> car<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
car in front of you and your car at a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
car in front of you and your car at a
consistent<00:00:34.290> pace<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> corrects<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
consistent pace and it corrects the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.360 
consistent pace and it corrects the
distance<00:00:36.570> between<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.320> based<00:00:38.100> on

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
distance between the two of you based on

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
distance between the two of you based on
the<00:00:39.000> speed<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.780> speed<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.620> cruise

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the speed the speed you have your cruise

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
the speed the speed you have your cruise
control<00:00:40.829> set<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.510> three

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
control set so there are actually three

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
control set so there are actually three
settings<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.739> ahead<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.890> turn<00:00:44.070> our<00:00:44.100> cruise

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
settings so go ahead and turn our cruise

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.510 
settings so go ahead and turn our cruise
control<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.329> Kristin<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
control on there Kristin this is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740 
control on there Kristin this is
Kristin's<00:00:47.850> first<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.210> using<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> cruise

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
Kristin's first time using the cruise

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
Kristin's first time using the cruise
control<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:50.100> she's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> little

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
control so I think she's a little

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.130 
control so I think she's a little
terrified<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
terrified because you really have to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.040 
terrified because you really have to
trust<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> dorg<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:54.780> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
trust the dorg and that that actually is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
trust the dorg and that that actually is
quite<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> joyful<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.430> me<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.809> go<00:00:57.809> ahead

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
quite a joyful thing for me and go ahead

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
quite a joyful thing for me and go ahead
Kristen<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> set<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.309> wrong<00:00:59.460> speed

catch up to our coworker there are three

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.310 
catch up to our coworker there are three
levels<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> adaptive<00:01:19.170> cruise<00:01:19.259> control

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
levels on the adaptive cruise control

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
levels on the adaptive cruise control
one<00:01:20.100> two<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.600> one<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.970> approximately<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
one two or three one is approximately a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.800 
one two or three one is approximately a
second<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> half<00:01:26.330> distance<00:01:27.330> between<00:01:27.479> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
second and a half distance between you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
second and a half distance between you
and<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> person<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> front<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and the person in front of you and then

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
and the person in front of you and then
three<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.450> about<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> half<00:01:30.990> seconds<00:01:31.380> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
three is about two and a half seconds so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.070 
three is about two and a half seconds so
here<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> sixty<00:01:32.520> miles<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.820> hour

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
here we go up to sixty miles an hour

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.410 
here we go up to sixty miles an hour
and<00:01:34.580> again<00:01:35.580> our<00:01:35.610> co-workers<00:01:36.060> should<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.270> doing

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and again our co-workers should be doing

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
and again our co-workers should be doing
about<00:01:36.570> 55<00:01:37.050> so<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.710> come<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.100> her

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
a little bit right okay we have a red

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.080

lights<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.580> stop<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> red

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
lights we do have to stop for the red

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.790 
lights we do have to stop for the red
light<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.450> won't<00:02:24.540> stop<00:02:24.870> us<00:02:25.020> completely<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:25.710> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
light it won't stop us completely but it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.070 
light it won't stop us completely but it
will<00:02:25.950> break<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.400> very<00:02:26.670> hard<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.810> need<00:02:27.990> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
will break you very hard if you need to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.840 
will break you very hard if you need to
slow<00:02:28.290> down<00:02:28.320> appropriately<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.850> basically

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
slow down appropriately so basically

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.250 
slow down appropriately so basically
that's<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.300> action<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:33.930> what<00:02:34.140> we're

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's it in action that's what we're

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.660 
that's it in action that's what we're
going<00:02:34.440> for<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.960> will<00:02:37.260> use<00:02:37.530> radar<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.640> detect

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
going for is it will use radar to detect

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
going for is it will use radar to detect
the<00:02:39.060> car<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.239> front<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.600> they<00:02:40.170> will<00:02:40.290> tell

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the car in front of you they will tell

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.780 
the car in front of you they will tell
you<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.100> car<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.459> front<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you it can see a car in front of you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550 
you it can see a car in front of you
there's<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.090> icon<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.510> screen<00:02:42.660> shows<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there's an icon on your screen shows a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560 
there's an icon on your screen shows a
little<00:02:43.739> car<00:02:44.010> shows<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> number<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> bars<00:02:45.420> and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
little car shows the number of bars and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990 
little car shows the number of bars and
the<00:02:45.720> gap<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.070> one<00:02:47.250> bar<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.640> gap<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the gap so if it's one bar the gap is a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
the gap so if it's one bar the gap is a
second<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.390> half<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.720> its<00:02:48.840> three<00:02:49.050> bars<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.500> gap

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
second a half of its three bars the gap

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.949 
second a half of its three bars the gap
is<00:02:49.800> about<00:02:49.980> two<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> half<00:02:50.340> second<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
is about two and a half second and it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.229 
is about two and a half second and it
will<00:02:52.110> show<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.310> registering<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> car

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
will show that it is registering a car

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.760 
will show that it is registering a car
in<00:02:54.390> front<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.780> now<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> only<00:02:55.200> works<00:02:55.500> when

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
in front of you now it only works when

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.170 
in front of you now it only works when
the<00:02:55.800> speed<00:02:56.100> when<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.670> cruise<00:02:56.820> control<00:02:56.850> is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the speed when the cruise control is

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.840 
the speed when the cruise control is
working<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.890> after<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.250> stoplight<00:02:59.700> for

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
working and after the stoplight for

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.190 
working and after the stoplight for
example<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.390> resume<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
example we have to resume to get the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.820 
example we have to resume to get the
cruise<00:03:01.350> control<00:03:01.380> back<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.350> now<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.590> have

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
cruise control back on and now we have

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.010 
cruise control back on and now we have
