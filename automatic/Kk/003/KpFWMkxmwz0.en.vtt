00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
my hand mixer again and I'm just going

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.479 
my hand mixer again and I'm just going
to<00:02:06.790> mix<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.390> until<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:08.200> combines<00:02:08.979> into<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
to mix this until it combines into a

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.660 
to mix this until it combines into a
cohesive<00:02:10.119> dough<00:02:10.569> this<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.560> take<00:02:11.770> about<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
cohesive dough this will take about a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.150 
cohesive dough this will take about a
minute<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.180> two<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.620> low<00:02:14.620> speed<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.890> dough<00:02:17.950> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
minute or two on low speed my dough is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.030 
minute or two on low speed my dough is
nicely<00:02:18.910> combined<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.780> will<00:02:19.989> say<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.830> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
nicely combined and I will say that it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.060 
nicely combined and I will say that it
might<00:02:21.280> look<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.640> little<00:02:21.670> bit<00:02:21.910> crumbly<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
might look a little bit crumbly but you

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.250 
might look a little bit crumbly but you
know<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.670> well<00:02:25.269> combined<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.019> take

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
know that it's well combined if you take

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.470 
know that it's well combined if you take
a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:26.530> bit<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> crumbles<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:28.209> squish

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
a little bit of the crumbles just squish

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.759 
a little bit of the crumbles just squish
it<00:02:28.540> with<00:02:28.720> your<00:02:28.870> hand<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.350> if<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.560> holds

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
it with your hand and if it holds

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.970 
it with your hand and if it holds
together<00:02:30.070> like<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.850> it's<00:02:31.209> ready<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.260> what
