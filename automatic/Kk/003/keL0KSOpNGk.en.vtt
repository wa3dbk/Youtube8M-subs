awareness<00:00:45.230> pass<00:00:46.230> walk<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.829> too<00:00:46.980> great<00:00:47.160> but

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
awareness pass walk is not too great but

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
awareness pass walk is not too great but
run<00:00:47.520> block<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.149> amazing<00:00:48.559> for

run block is pretty amazing for

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.819 
run block is pretty amazing for
Gronkowski<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.520> he's<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.789> too<00:00:50.969> great<00:00:51.239> at

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
Gronkowski because he's not too great at

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
Gronkowski because he's not too great at
blocking<00:00:52.910> but<00:00:53.910> 92<00:00:54.270> strength<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.719> well<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.140> very

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
blocking but 92 strength as well so very

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
blocking but 92 strength as well so very
good<00:00:55.530> card<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.879> hopefully<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> pull<00:00:57.600> him

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and also the next one is I think John

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.969 
and also the next one is I think John
Randle<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:05.869> no<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.170> pulled<00:01:07.470> him<00:01:07.680> or

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
Randle and no one has pulled him or

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.800 
Randle and no one has pulled him or
