00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
blender with part 4 in our series about

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.390 
blender with part 4 in our series about
rendering<00:00:14.910> bricks<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.600> blender<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:17.130> our<00:00:17.220> last

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
rendering bricks in blender in our last

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.070 
rendering bricks in blender in our last
tutorial<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.090> got<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.369> little<00:00:20.369> scene<00:00:20.760> setup<00:00:21.090> we

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
tutorial we got a little scene setup we

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.349 
tutorial we got a little scene setup we
did<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.710> different<00:00:23.160> lighting<00:00:23.580> tricks<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
did some different lighting tricks and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.900 
did some different lighting tricks and
we<00:00:25.140> modified<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.920> bricks<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> make

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
we modified the bricks a little to make

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.859 
we modified the bricks a little to make
them<00:00:27.150> look<00:00:27.839> a<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.259> more<00:00:28.650> realistic<00:00:29.720> at<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
them look a bit more realistic at the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.840 
them look a bit more realistic at the
end<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.199> last<00:00:31.380> tutorial<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:32.040> were<00:00:32.189> still<00:00:32.580> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
end of our last tutorial we were still a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
end of our last tutorial we were still a
ways<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.970> realism<00:00:35.970> still<00:00:36.900> didn't<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ways out of realism still didn't just

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.190 
ways out of realism still didn't just
just<00:00:38.520> they're<00:00:39.390> they're<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.720> looking<00:00:39.900> quite

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
just they're they're not looking quite

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.590 
just they're they're not looking quite
right<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.670> gonna<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.030> another<00:00:42.210> render

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
right and I'm gonna do another render

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
right and I'm gonna do another render
here<00:00:42.810> but<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.280> gonna

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
here but first thing first I'm gonna

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
here but first thing first I'm gonna
quickly<00:00:44.760> turn<00:00:45.120> off<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.690> Rainier<00:00:46.470> setting

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
quickly turn off the Rainier setting

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.120 
quickly turn off the Rainier setting
that<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.280> had<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.790> our<00:00:47.880> last<00:00:47.940> tutorial<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:52.130> is

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
that we had in our last tutorial this is

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.840 
that we had in our last tutorial this is
an<00:00:53.850> amazing<00:00:54.510> effect<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:56.040> our<00:00:56.250> purposes

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
an amazing effect but for our purposes

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.350 
an amazing effect but for our purposes
right<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.980> we're<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.370> leave<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> off<00:00:59.820> until

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
right now we're gonna leave it off until

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.950 
right now we're gonna leave it off until
maybe<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.750> end<00:01:00.900> one<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.200> switch<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.130> back<00:01:02.220> on

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
maybe the end one will switch it back on

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
maybe the end one will switch it back on
okay<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.019> let's<00:01:04.259> take<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> look<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.159> we

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
okay so let's take a look at what we

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
okay so let's take a look at what we
have<00:01:06.619> okay<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.970> render<00:01:09.750> with

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have okay so there's the render with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
have okay so there's the render with
Rainier<00:01:10.410> off<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.730> will<00:01:11.850> probably<00:01:12.000> won't

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Rainier off and you will probably won't

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.850 
Rainier off and you will probably won't
know<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.750> too<00:01:12.900> much<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> difference<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
know it's too much of a difference but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.270 
know it's too much of a difference but
yeah<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.000> mean<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.690> just<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.100> looks

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
yeah I mean it just it's it's it looks

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
yeah I mean it just it's it's it looks
ok<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> bricks<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.180> okay<00:01:18.510> but<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
ok the bricks are okay but it's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.170 
ok the bricks are okay but it's
definitely<00:01:19.350> missing<00:01:19.860> something<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.970> we're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
definitely missing something so we're

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
definitely missing something so we're
gonna<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.510> gonna<00:01:21.570> spend<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.440> next<00:01:22.620> few

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
gonna we're gonna spend the next few

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.300 
gonna we're gonna spend the next few
videos<00:01:23.270> continuing<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.510> improve<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:25.380> I'm

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
videos continuing to improve this I'm

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
videos continuing to improve this I'm
holding<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:26.909> hand<00:01:27.300> right<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.780> 2<00:01:28.080> by<00:01:28.440> 4

Lego brick and what I notice is that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
Lego brick and what I notice is that
each<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.770> studs<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.580> word<00:01:32.760> Lego

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
each one of the studs has the word Lego

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
each one of the studs has the word Lego
printed<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.990> it

which<00:02:18.939> basically<00:02:19.939> it<00:02:20.090> brings<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.629> file<00:02:20.930> in

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
which basically it brings the file in

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.630 
which basically it brings the file in
but<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:21.439> can't<00:02:21.739> edit<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.159> at<00:02:22.280> all

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
but you can't edit it at all

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.530 
but you can't edit it at all
so<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.030> really<00:02:24.019> saves<00:02:24.349> on<00:02:24.650> file<00:02:25.010> size<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.760> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so that really saves on file size or you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
so that really saves on file size or you
can<00:02:26.750> append<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.379> which<00:02:27.500> actually<00:02:28.040> brings<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
can append it which actually brings the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.210 
can append it which actually brings the
mesh<00:02:28.879> into<00:02:29.530> your<00:02:30.530> file<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:31.040> working

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
mesh into your file that you're working

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.960 
mesh into your file that you're working
on<00:02:31.519> currently<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.510> we're<00:02:32.750> gonna<00:02:32.870> append<00:02:33.230> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
on currently so we're gonna append it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.350 
on currently so we're gonna append it
and<00:02:35.530> it'll<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.650> somewhere<00:02:37.159> I'm<00:02:37.790> not<00:02:37.970> quite

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
and it'll be somewhere I'm not quite

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.520 
and it'll be somewhere I'm not quite
sure<00:02:38.390> where<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:38.980> somewhere<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:41.530> alright

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
sure where but somewhere in here alright

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.710 
sure where but somewhere in here alright
let's<00:02:42.829> see<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.159> can<00:02:43.310> find<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:47.480> what<00:02:47.629> do

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
let's see if we can find it now what do

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.750 
let's see if we can find it now what do
you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.230> actually<00:02:48.739> on<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.370> different

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
you know it's actually on a different

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:03.970 
you know it's actually on a different
layer<00:02:49.970> okay<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:59.440> this<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.769> my<00:03:01.519> Lego<00:03:02.150> mesh<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
layer okay so this is my Lego mesh and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.190 
layer okay so this is my Lego mesh and
we're<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.510> we're<00:03:05.510> gonna<00:03:05.569> duplicate

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
we're going to we're gonna duplicate

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.080 
we're going to we're gonna duplicate
this<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.409> put<00:03:06.799> this<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.069> every<00:03:07.579> single<00:03:07.609> one<00:03:08.030> of

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
this and put this on every single one of

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.319 
this and put this on every single one of
the<00:03:08.269> studs<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.900> know<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.859> sounds<00:03:10.400> may<00:03:11.000> be<00:03:11.180> like

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
the studs I know that sounds may be like

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.180 
the studs I know that sounds may be like
a<00:03:11.359> bit<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> crazy<00:03:12.049> thing<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.769> said<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.099> the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
a bit of a crazy thing but I said in the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.180 
a bit of a crazy thing but I said in the
previous<00:03:13.459> video<00:03:14.290> realism<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.470> all<00:03:15.620> about<00:03:15.829> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
previous video realism is all about the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.160 
previous video realism is all about the
subtle<00:03:16.670> effects<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.049> those

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
subtle effects and this is one of those

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.289 
subtle effects and this is one of those
effects<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.889> when<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.909> a<00:03:19.940> close-up

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
effects that when you have a close-up

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.479 
effects that when you have a close-up
shot<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.720> bricks<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.590> think<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> want<00:03:22.669> it<00:03:22.790> so

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
shot of bricks I think you want it so

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.439 
shot of bricks I think you want it so
what<00:03:25.489> we're<00:03:25.609> gonna<00:03:25.699> do<00:03:25.879> is<00:03:26.030> we're<00:03:26.180> going<00:03:26.329> to

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:36.220 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
rotate<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.139> by<00:03:27.230> hitting<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.590> R<00:03:27.769> key<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:34.959> G<00:03:35.959> to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
rotate it by hitting the R key and G to

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.559 
rotate it by hitting the R key and G to
move<00:03:36.889> it<00:03:37.160> over<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.639> where<00:03:37.819> we<00:03:37.940> want<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.389> go

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
move it over to where we want it to go

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.360 
move it over to where we want it to go
and<00:03:39.049> we're<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.319> gonna<00:03:39.470> position<00:03:39.919> it<00:03:40.160> right

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
and we're just gonna position it right

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.839 
and we're just gonna position it right

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
right position again I have a Lego brick

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:12.909 
right position again I have a Lego brick
in<00:04:05.629> my<00:04:05.659> hand<00:04:06.109> for<00:04:06.409> reference<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:11.799> I'm<00:04:12.799> just

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
gonna try to get along with the XS axis

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.339 
gonna try to get along with the XS axis
and<00:04:16.190> then<00:04:16.789> kind<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.209> scale<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.959> down<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.169> bit

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
and then kind of scale it down a bit

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:27.710 
and then kind of scale it down a bit
along<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:18.919> y<00:04:19.760> axis<00:04:19.840> oops<00:04:21.520> just<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.669> little<00:04:22.940> bit
