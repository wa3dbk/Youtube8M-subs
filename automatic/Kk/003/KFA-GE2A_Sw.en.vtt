if glitch fix actually does help

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.420 
if glitch fix actually does help
an<00:00:35.600> effort<00:00:36.050> apiece<00:00:36.320> which<00:00:36.560> I'm<00:00:36.950> gonna<00:00:37.100> check

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
an effort apiece which I'm gonna check

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.200 
an effort apiece which I'm gonna check
the<00:00:37.580> ending<00:00:37.910> first<00:00:38.090> before<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.540> do<00:00:38.660> anything

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.020 

now<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:53.979> cloud<00:01:54.310> goes<00:01:54.520> away<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:55.479> right

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030

cloud<00:02:01.690> goes<00:02:01.930> away<00:02:02.080> only<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.100> kill<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.580> by

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
cloud goes away only if you kill it by

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.230 
cloud goes away only if you kill it by
the<00:02:03.820> head<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.619> cloud<00:02:05.890> stays<00:02:06.460> around<00:02:06.759> for<00:02:07.090> like

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the head the cloud stays around for like

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.029 
the head the cloud stays around for like
a<00:02:07.299> bit<00:02:07.600> but<00:02:07.840> if<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.289> kill<00:02:08.649> them<00:02:08.740> what<00:02:08.920> the

a bit but if you kill them what the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.840 
a bit but if you kill them what the
shell<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:10.209> cloud<00:02:10.420> never<00:02:10.660> goes<00:02:10.869> away<00:02:11.850> pretty

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
shell the cloud never goes away pretty

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.059 
shell the cloud never goes away pretty
sure<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.090> how<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> works

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
