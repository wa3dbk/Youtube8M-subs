00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.240
 knitting purl loop non-standard 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.020
 continental method for the front 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.300
 loop wall with this method working 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.810
 the thread we pounce on 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.770
 index finger of the left hand and then 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.480
 clamped with three fingers of his left hand 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.960
 right hand take the knitting needle but take it 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.140
 not as usual but non-standard 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 way since we hold a pen this 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.379
 method of knitting purl loop 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 used in cases where the right 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.680
 is the front wall of the loop and with 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.970
 the left side is the rear wall 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.930
 loops and throws a working thread 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 in front of the left knitting needle then the right knitting needle 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.530
 we get 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.869
 from the bottom to the inside of our loop on the right 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.820
 to the left we take the right knitting needle like that 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.369
 way to capture 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:33.490
 thread from the index finger and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.859
 we pull this thread through the loop then 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.600
 the needle is retracted to the right side and 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:47.259
 the loop with the left knitting needle is removed then 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.530
 middle finger of the right hand push 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.189
 slightly forward holding on to a new one 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 loop 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 there is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 another opportunity to knit 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.160
 back loop behind the front wall 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.700
 loops a little bit different for this 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.050
 the right needle is inserted into the loop on the right 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.330
 to the left and then grab the worker thread 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.240
 not like we did in the previous one 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.360
 way and on the other hand like this 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.530
 we drag 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.520
 this thread through the loop is then retracted 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:38.620
 right needle to the right and loop to the left 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:40.840
 The spokes then collides with the middle finger. 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.470
 right hand 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.430
 hold the new loop 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.100
 in this case 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.380
 loop on the right spoke will 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.380
 located in the other direction 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.830
