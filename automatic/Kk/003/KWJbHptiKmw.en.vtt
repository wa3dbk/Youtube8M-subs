00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
does feature a six-pack so that's pretty

cool

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
cool

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.120 
cool
and<00:02:46.550> honestly<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.390> what<00:02:48.020> certain<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
and honestly this is what certain like a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.130 
and honestly this is what certain like a
fans<00:02:49.490> wanted<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.450> gonna<00:02:50.630> make<00:02:50.810> for<00:02:51.050> their

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
fans wanted like gonna make for their

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.980 
fans wanted like gonna make for their
Hulk<00:02:51.350> minifigure<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.610> guess<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.300> way<00:02:53.330> they

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
Hulk minifigure so I guess in a way they

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.570 
Hulk minifigure so I guess in a way they
were<00:02:54.050> kind<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.620> making<00:02:54.860> everyone<00:02:55.190> happy<00:02:55.340> with

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
were kind of making everyone happy with

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.310 
were kind of making everyone happy with
this<00:02:55.820> Hulk<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.540> some<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.780> some<00:02:57.050> people

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
this Hulk because some of some people

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.930 
this Hulk because some of some people
didn't<00:02:57.530> really<00:02:57.650> appreciate<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.820> know<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
didn't really appreciate you know the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.700 
didn't really appreciate you know the
Hulk<00:02:59.180> Lego<00:02:59.450> put<00:02:59.690> out<00:02:59.810> because<00:03:00.290> they<00:03:00.410> felt<00:03:00.650> like

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
Hulk Lego put out because they felt like

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.940 
Hulk Lego put out because they felt like
it<00:03:00.890> wasn't<00:03:01.070> really<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.850> know<00:03:01.970> Lego<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.560> I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
it wasn't really you know Lego so I

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.199 
it wasn't really you know Lego so I
guess<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.030> Legos<00:03:05.600> kind<00:03:06.020> of<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.790> way<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.820> say

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
guess this is Legos kind of a way to say

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.620 
guess this is Legos kind of a way to say
that<00:03:08.690> they<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.110> heard<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.380> guys<00:03:10.690> puny<00:03:11.690> Hulk

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
that they they heard you guys puny Hulk

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.620 
that they they heard you guys puny Hulk
yeah<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.810> run<00:03:15.050> but<00:03:15.770> as<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:16.760> see<00:03:16.820> his

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
yeah you run but as you can see his

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.380 
yeah you run but as you can see his
purple<00:03:18.380> pants<00:03:18.680> are<00:03:18.800> printed<00:03:19.190> onto<00:03:19.340> there<00:03:19.580> so

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
purple pants are printed onto there so

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.180 
purple pants are printed onto there so
obviously<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:21.440> might<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.740> based<00:03:21.920> off<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
obviously this might be based off the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.680 
obviously this might be based off the
Avengers<00:03:22.520> but<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.730> surely<00:03:22.910> hope<00:03:23.150> not<00:03:23.360> because

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
Avengers but I surely hope not because

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.970 
Avengers but I surely hope not because
he<00:03:23.810> does<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.080> have<00:03:24.230> purple<00:03:24.560> pants<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:24.920> he

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
he does not have purple pants and he

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.240 
he does not have purple pants and he
Avengers<00:03:25.600> as<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:27.560> can<00:03:27.680> see<00:03:27.830> does<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
Avengers as you can see does have a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.610 
Avengers as you can see does have a
purple<00:03:28.730> belt<00:03:28.850> which<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.810> pretty<00:03:30.170> cool<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.590> he

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
purple belt which is pretty cool and he

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.070 
purple belt which is pretty cool and he
does<00:03:30.800> have<00:03:31.010> two<00:03:31.760> black<00:03:32.000> dots<00:03:32.209> printed

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
does have two black dots printed

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.420 
does have two black dots printed
symmetrically<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.620> both<00:03:33.769> sides<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.280> front

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
symmetrically on both sides of the front

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.449 
symmetrically on both sides of the front
of<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.870> back<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.310> no

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
of it the back of it there is no

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.640 
of it the back of it there is no
printing<00:03:37.730> but<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.959> some<00:03:39.260> extra

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
printing but there is some extra

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.440 
printing but there is some extra
printing<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.070> back<00:03:40.250> there<00:03:40.489> which<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.390> very

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
printing on the back there which is very

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.160 
printing on the back there which is very
cool<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.140> just<00:03:42.440> makes<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.769> figure<00:03:43.070> look

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
cool and just makes it a figure look

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.190 
cool and just makes it a figure look
more<00:03:45.170> realistic<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.680> guess<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.510> his<00:03:47.510> face<00:03:47.870> is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
more realistic I guess and his face is

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.900 
more realistic I guess and his face is
just<00:03:48.500> very<00:03:49.010> well<00:03:49.280> done<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:50.720> can<00:03:50.900> see<00:03:51.140> there
