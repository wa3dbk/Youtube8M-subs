pressure-treated<00:00:24.080> runner<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> bottom

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
pressure-treated runner on the bottom

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.550

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
helped keep the you know bugs and well

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.850 
helped keep the you know bugs and well
on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> set<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> bugs<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.770> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
on the set of bugs but you know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.550 
on the set of bugs but you know
predators<00:01:11.369> snakes<00:01:12.090> weasels<00:01:12.960> from<00:01:13.140> getting<00:01:13.409> in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
predators snakes weasels from getting in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
predators snakes weasels from getting in
and<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> used<00:01:15.990> regular<00:01:16.170> old<00:01:16.560> chicken

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and we just used regular old chicken

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
and we just used regular old chicken
wire<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.880> recommend<00:01:18.060> using<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
wire I would not recommend using it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
wire I would not recommend using it
because<00:01:18.810> already<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.710> we've<00:01:20.040> had<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.430> less

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
because already is we've had it less

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.240 
because already is we've had it less
than<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> year<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.840> already<00:01:22.229> rusting<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
than a year it's already rusting and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.940 
than a year it's already rusting and
getting<00:01:23.850> holes<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.930> hope<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> replace

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
getting holes in it so I hope to replace

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.840 
getting holes in it so I hope to replace
it<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.850> welded<00:01:27.210> wire<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:29.430> before<00:01:29.700> inch

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it with just welded wire to before inch

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
it with just welded wire to before inch
and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.780> had<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> door<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> front<00:01:31.500> here

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and then we had a door on the front here

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
and then we had a door on the front here
do<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> did<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.509> took<00:01:33.659> an

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
do you see now what we did is we took an

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
do you see now what we did is we took an
old<00:01:33.900> dog<00:01:34.140> kennel<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.400> made<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> big<00:01:35.850> runt

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
old dog kennel it made a big runt

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.370 
old dog kennel it made a big runt
whereas<00:01:36.450> more<00:01:36.570> free<00:01:36.810> range<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> where<00:01:37.290> we

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
whereas more free range to where we

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
whereas more free range to where we
don't<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> move<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.060> every<00:01:39.060> single<00:01:39.689> day

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
don't have to move it every single day

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
don't have to move it every single day
because<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:42.000> hard<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> know

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
because that can be really hard you know

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
because that can be really hard you know
it's<00:01:42.630> fine<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.079> moving<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.610> every<00:01:44.610> day<00:01:44.640> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it's fine for moving them every day in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's fine for moving them every day in
the<00:01:44.939> summer<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.229> winter

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the summer but when you get into winter

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
the summer but when you get into winter
months<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> grounds<00:01:47.700> real<00:01:47.850> soft<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> stuff

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
months the grounds real soft and stuff

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.940 
months the grounds real soft and stuff
he<00:01:48.689> gets<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.079> hard<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> move<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.619> she<00:01:49.740> put

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
he gets really hard to move when she put

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.749 
he gets really hard to move when she put
some<00:01:50.159> bigger<00:01:50.369> tires<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> great

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
some bigger tires on it but it's a great

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
some bigger tires on it but it's a great
little<00:01:53.939> design<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> saying<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
little design I'm not saying it's the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.870 
little design I'm not saying it's the
best<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.159> improvements

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
best you know I know for improvements

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
