00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.340
 but yes yes yes but this spirit does 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.300
 make less are a type of dilate a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.300
 moment and a half of the violin ride 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.000
 thematic if used with landline 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.650
 you don't let it mount until it arrives 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.950
 flag and when those returns that between 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.710
 hands a little more than me liminale no 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:42.890
 when the rhythm the final hi is one 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.680
 spectator I can tell you something not there 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.690
 we know bye bye bye bye I would like to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.629
 ask what I write I am the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.650
 alongside the manufacturer that boy is 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.239
 losing the hair rack the piece that 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.330
 I like it very much of course I heard it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.100
 so much is the scene that you write 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.110
 alessandro as you may have read also 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.080
 beyond where this piece is 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.180
 photography that comes alive, etc. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.770
 I as a spectator who in that case I read 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 this scene but then I want to see at 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.700
 cinema somehow gave me one 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.270
 feeling of great joy 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.890
 so in the end it leaves above all the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.370
 piece because it is born as it is born obviously 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.110
 there is a vein like melancholy 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.299
 I challenge what they are they don't know 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.190
 to judge this I am in that final which 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.770
 own soul presents a photograph or 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.600
 twenty people of the interruption 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.460
 photos of the history of sergio that then 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.500
 somehow this delirium that 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.450
 however it is not a debt it is a border delusion 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.220
 at that moment a moment of joy 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.800
 would like the viewer jewelry i 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 sings do not seem strange reasoning and 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.940
 just the whole world and that is of 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.310
 second of women why not disfigure the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.560
 final between science and nature in your 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.630
 piece that part of the cembra run 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.310
 sad even though between science but it is 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.980
 shared in a looks sad it seems 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 what indeed he argued that 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.830
 surely this surely is it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.330
 I also say what he says as an excuse 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 and it makes euros I had put around 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.319
 an opening of the heart a little more are not 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.579
 reciting however an opening not 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.280
 is not it, that we well on the final 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.280
 of the movie those people 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.840
 sorry for the death 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.840
 then we think we're sorry
