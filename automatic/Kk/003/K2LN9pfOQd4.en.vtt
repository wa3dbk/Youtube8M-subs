00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi what the prose march and the video of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.960
 today is the girl's book review 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.880
 submersed written by the one I clicked 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.870
 published in brazil by the publisher dark 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.730
 side 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.509
 I received this book through the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 prose show with the publisher and I started 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.630
 the law he last month ended yesterday 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 It 's beautiful so it's hard to read in the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 At first I thought he was a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 fast reading because it is a book 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.420
 small is not a big book but it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.340
 a book and is much attention is those 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.070
 more tense readings that you delay 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 to absorb and he tells the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 morgan phelps history of india 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 a young woman and she writes a book as 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.750
 was a kind of a diary the diary of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.030
 her thoughts to herself that the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.539
 photo of her and their mother says the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 two were killed and she is afraid to India 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.300
 to be like the rest of the women in the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 her family then writes and if these 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 thoughts like a kind of outburst 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.189
 her for herself 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 so what happens she has some 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.020
 problems, so her narrative is very 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.020
 nonlinear it begins at present to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 from the past puts the tales in the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.970
 halfway through the difficult narrative of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 keep up but that is very good 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.290
 It's a friend of mine she had told me before 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.869
 begin reading that in the middle of the book he 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.909
 getting a little annoying I did not have this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.640
 impression I felt that until the middle of the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 book reading and slow reading 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.439
 difficult to read that creeps a little 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 but that from the middle to the front the book catches 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.500
 legal rhythm and the major proposal of the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 her book is India she begins to write the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 memories of it here in a way that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.680
 comes to understand that she will tell a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.090
 ghost story she even says 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.149
 I 'm here to tell a story. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.740
 about ghosts but in the middle of the book 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.180
 You start to wonder if she's 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.219
 really with a whole story about 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 ghosts or if she can not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.829
 differentiate the reality of the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 fiction 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 this is something that has stayed for me 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.450
 very light in the middle of the book so I 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.970
 I see this book 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 with a ghost story I do not think 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.129
 that has a ghost story that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.870
 I think it's all schizophrenia 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.800
 and I think that 's the big one. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.510
 discussion in the book you can believe 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.730
 in it you can try to follow the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.620
 thinking of her or you can give up 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.200
 her in the middle of the book to understand 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.750
 crazy and ending and that's what is 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 happening to us there behind two 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.000
 very important characters in the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.390
 story 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 one of them is blink and her ex girlfriend 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.310
 which appears rather but is not yet the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.810
 second most important character of the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.910
 story the second most 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.970
 important part of the story is to evoke 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.579
 there will want a woman that one day 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.069
 still found standing on the edge of the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.170
 road in the whole wet and we 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.260
 decided to help her, she went home 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.290
 lended her another and the girl left 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.360
 and this is a remarkable event in the book 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.940
 because after that the Indian narration 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.859
 it gets much more confusing and you 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.769
 stay on that try to follow the thought 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.900
 she thinks that the girl 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.090
 can be a werewolf dressed up as a person 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.700
 that she can be a mermaid she can be 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.880
 a ghost or she may be a person 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.519
 and India is traveling on it. 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.560
 so you have several outputs to 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.209
 believe in this book is a very 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.700
 cool was the book that held me 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.220
 quite a lot is mainly in the last 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.799
 100 pages about everything in one day because 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.260
 It was very cool, I was very 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.420
 yummy then toss this book is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 you give up the books you are 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.450
 accustomed to reading that has a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.760
 that has a history that makes 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.920
 I can not even play it because he is 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.109
 an entirely different reading is a 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.269
 reading that will require you and 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.170
 So honestly detach from books that 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.810
 Have you read and dedicated yourself? 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.370
 understand how it works I guess 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.510
 that little one did a job 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.340
 great 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.770
 the book is very well set up 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.690
 including one of the artists who 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.270
 important it refers to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.340
 these two artists who would only be a sun 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.319
 and pierre 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.580
 I came to believe that I was an artist 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.500
 I really arrived. I got to 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.750
 google search and that's when I discovered 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.280
 that it is not his works until 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.190
 can you find it on google because 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.950
 some fans of the book wanted to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.380
 replica of the tables that were 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.540
 mentioned during the book also 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.100
 He mentions the case of very black dahlia 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.210
 it was a murder that happened in 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.550
 hollywood in 1946 of 40 which was the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.120
 murder of a young actress called 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.530
 elizabeth short and is a case that until today 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.139
 had no solution 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.330
 I watched some videos about this case 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.130
 since what I know is that one of the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.440
 researchers began to distrust the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.820
 own father that the father was a surgeon and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.229
 probably he was the only one who 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.120
 could have committed this crime for 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.960
 money he had contact with eliza de 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.880
 short and black eagle was not a case 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.729
 very famous for the issue of violence and 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.650
 because there is no solution because 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.680
 because the body of this woman he went 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.320
 found cut in the middle type trunk and 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.760
 legs apart in a very 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.770
 you need it in a way that did not 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.410
 no organ in the port no other besides 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.640
 to separate the column so he knew the 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.550
 who was someone who had knowledge 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.979
 doctor killed the police 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.690
 sending letters anyway 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.710
 police were never able to identify who 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.680
 it's our signature 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.780
 it makes many references to this case in 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.310
 So it 's important to know a little bit 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.680
 about them not you she starts to 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.789
 mentioned law and isabel short you do not 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.710
 Can you understand anything, you do not do much? 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.890
 I sense here because as I said there 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.200
 for schizophrenia then you have to 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.539
 take care of her but it's a read that counts 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.770
 very worth it, it 's very wonderful, I 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.650
 I'm saying he's the most 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.510
 It's beautiful, I have it here on my shelf. 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.480
 special issue should be special she 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.280
 Bring this gorgeous cover all in black 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.070
 in high relief you can feel 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.020
 all the nuances of the cover with this 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.290
 dragonfly that has to do with history 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.800
 because the psychiatrist cleans she collects 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:18.130
 invertebrates it is legal to imagine the 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.310
 the pages of the book nelson rosa here in 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.020
 renovated inside it has a reading 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.210
 very nice 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.040
 the yellow pages the letters have a 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:32.800
 good size and it has the legal details 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.650
 and I do not have much frustration and I have 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.970
 end and he has a few details of 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.250
 ornaments so things I like 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.440
 much to do that are always very nice 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.990
 A 5 book makes the book came with a 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.780
 object of collector himself and he 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.640
 also comes then it comes together 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.290
 This coloring page I do not have 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.270
 talent for coloring I'll ask the 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.650
 My brother colors me because I do not 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.640
 I know how to do this and this marker in seven 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:09.550
 years also cool 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.410
 Congratulations, as always, I try to avoid 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.160
 talk as much because as an agent 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.290
 partner 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.990
 I think it seems that the only compliment 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.330
 because of it but no no I would not have 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.580
 partnership if I did not believe in a 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.170
 on the dark side potential his book 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.550
 the books they are wonderful and if they

 from here is no exception 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.460
 Good folks, yes, it was a girl's review.

 linear narrative 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.230
