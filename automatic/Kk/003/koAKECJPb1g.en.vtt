00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.910 
sometimes is an absolute bitch focusing
so<00:02:33.090> I'm<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> tell<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> guys<00:02:34.620> what

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so I'm just going to tell you guys what

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.660 
so I'm just going to tell you guys what
it<00:02:35.040> what<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.490> says<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:37.190> 3.3<00:02:38.190> volt<00:02:38.460> rail

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it what it says on there 3.3 volt rail

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.470 
it what it says on there 3.3 volt rail
can<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.180> whopping<00:02:39.630> 24<00:02:40.260> amps<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> five

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
can do a whopping 24 amps and the five

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.960 
can do a whopping 24 amps and the five
volt<00:02:42.720> rail<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.440> 24<00:02:43.950> combine<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.790> can

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
volt rail can also do 24 combine you can

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.340 
volt rail can also do 24 combine you can
get<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.500> 130<00:02:46.500> watts<00:02:47.220> out<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.670> those<00:02:47.820> rails<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
get a 130 watts out of those rails the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.470 
get a 130 watts out of those rails the
12<00:02:49.650> volt<00:02:49.890> rail<00:02:50.240> well<00:02:51.240> there's<00:02:51.530> two<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.560> them

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
12 volt rail well there's two of them

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.690 
12 volt rail well there's two of them
one<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.710> 24<00:02:56.130> volts<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
one of them can do 24 volts and the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.240 
one of them can do 24 volts and the
other<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.120> also<00:02:57.210> do<00:02:57.420> 24<00:02:57.900> volts<00:02:58.250> combine

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
other one can also do 24 volts combine

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.950 
other one can also do 24 volts combine
those<00:02:59.490> two<00:02:59.790> rails<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.480> give<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:02.450> 567<00:03:03.450> watts

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
those two rails can give you 567 watts

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.830 
those two rails can give you 567 watts
in<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.320> safe<00:03:04.530> way

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960 

there's<00:03:07.170> also<00:03:07.320> minus<00:03:07.860> 12<00:03:08.220> volt<00:03:08.490> rail<00:03:08.580> which

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
there's also minus 12 volt rail which

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.340 
there's also minus 12 volt rail which
can<00:03:09.180> do<00:03:09.420> 0.8<00:03:10.080> amps<00:03:11.120> giving<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.210> 9.6<00:03:12.900> watts<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
can do 0.8 amps giving in 9.6 watts and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.850 
can do 0.8 amps giving in 9.6 watts and
the<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:14.100> 5<00:03:14.310> volt<00:03:14.550> vsb<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.240> 2.5<00:03:16.080> amps<00:03:16.440> good<00:03:16.650> for

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the the 5 volt vsb is 2.5 amps good for

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.500 
the the 5 volt vsb is 2.5 amps good for
12.5<00:03:17.640> watts<00:03:19.310> that's<00:03:20.310> pretty<00:03:20.700> much<00:03:20.820> for<00:03:21.270> this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
12.5 watts that's pretty much for this

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.540 
12.5 watts that's pretty much for this

I<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.780> started<00:03:40.680> looking<00:03:41.010> at<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.490> way<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.850> f4

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
I I started looking at is the way the f4

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.960 
I I started looking at is the way the f4
pin<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.600> hooked<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.110> 20<00:03:43.530> pin<00:03:43.970> really

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
pin is hooked up to the 20 pin really

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.020 
pin is hooked up to the 20 pin really
nicely<00:03:45.209> hooked<00:03:45.600> up<00:03:45.780> there<00:03:46.670> there's<00:03:47.670> also<00:03:47.880> an

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
nicely hooked up there there's also an

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.850 
nicely hooked up there there's also an
additional<00:03:48.420> zip<00:03:48.630> tie<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.709> keep

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
additional zip tie here to keep

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.260 
additional zip tie here to keep
everything<00:03:50.190> together<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.730> would<00:03:51.030> suggest

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
everything together I would suggest

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.960 
everything together I would suggest
leaving<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.200> there

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
leaving that on there

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.470 
leaving that on there
you<00:03:54.510> then<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:55.050> PCI<00:03:55.709> connectors<00:03:56.360> so<00:03:57.360> you've

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
you then have PCI connectors so you've

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.520 
you then have PCI connectors so you've
got<00:03:57.630> 2<00:03:57.990> 8<00:03:58.200> pins<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:59.430> six<00:03:59.760> pin<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.990> says<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.410> a

about<00:05:21.090> great<00:05:22.090> value<00:05:22.539> for<00:05:22.720> money<00:05:23.190> components

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
about great value for money components

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.450 
about great value for money components
that<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.400> decided<00:05:24.910> to<00:05:25.030> use<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.500> big<00:05:27.160> great

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
that I decided to use and so big great

that I decided to use and so big great
value<00:05:27.880> for<00:05:28.030> money<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.449> there's<00:05:28.690> being<00:05:28.900> bronze

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
value for money and there's being bronze

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.589 
value for money and there's being bronze
which<00:05:29.979> kind<00:05:30.490> of<00:05:30.580> didn't<00:05:30.849> have<00:05:30.940> anything<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.449> do

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
which kind of didn't have anything to do

why not silver because I would like to
see<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:37.270> braiding<00:05:37.720> slightly<00:05:38.380> better

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
see the braiding slightly better

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.210 
see the braiding slightly better
why<00:05:39.849> not<00:05:40.090> gold<00:05:40.419> well<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:41.260> gold<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.620> should<00:05:41.889> it

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
why not gold well for gold it should it

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.399 
why not gold well for gold it should it
should<00:05:42.280> have<00:05:42.610> been<00:05:42.820> really<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.870> lot<00:05:44.199> more

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
efficient and I can live with rating if

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.029 
efficient and I can live with rating if
something's<00:05:48.789> really<00:05:48.909> efficient<00:05:49.510> but<00:05:49.990> yeah
