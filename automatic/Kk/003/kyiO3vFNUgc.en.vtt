00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.633
- So, "Repeat After Me,"

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:02.966
you're doing such a great job
hosting it.

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:03.966
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:08.600
for hosting that.
- Thank you.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600
- I know that the clip
we're gonna show

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.933
is you're in a different outfit
and your hair's different,

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.033
but you're getting--we've asked
you to kind of

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.266
keep the same outfit on
so we can interchange

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.300
'cause you never know which ones
we're putting together,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.566
and we didn't think anyone
would notice

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.866
you're wearing the same thing.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.033
But you're getting a lot of
people asking you

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.266
why you're wearing
the same thing.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.800
- People have a lot
of strong feelings about

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.666
my red jacket and metal fang
that I wear around my neck.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.600
- Uh-huh.
- And, yeah.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.166
We film things out of order.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.733
It didn't make sense
to keep changing clothes

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.466
because we didn't know
which shows were gonna go

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.233
with what guests and
blah-blah-blah,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.166
so, yes, I wear the same thing
all the time.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.700
- That's really funny.
- If we get a season two,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.233
I'd like to change
my clothes.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:54.366
- Okay.
All right. Well.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.300
- And maybe sit in a more
comfortable stool.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.833
- Okay.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.600
- Well, let's see if AB--
- Let's see if we do it, yeah.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.633
- If people watch the show,
and if ABC picks it up,

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:06.133
we're dangling that--
you'll see more outfits.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.366
And you'll get a more
comfortable--

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.633
- Right.
- Okay, so this is

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.233
tonight's episode, and is this
Ellen Pompeo?

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.733
Is this what we're watching?
Okay.

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.233
This is tonight's episode.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.066
- Now I need my foot spa.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.533
- You know what time it is?

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.700
- What's that?
- Foot spa.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.033
- Foot spa?
- It's important for me to stay

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.166
in tip-top shape, Patrick.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.966
- It's important for me
to stay in tip-top shape.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.566
- You look like you're
in incredible shape.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:35.133
- Put your hands in.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.133
You want to try it?
- You want to try it?

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.700
- Sure.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700
- Okay.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.866
Okay.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.833
Ellen?

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.466
Ellen?

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.466
Ellen?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.900
Okay, I did not
anticipate this.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.800
Have you ever been
to prison?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
- Have you ever
been to prison?

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.266
- All right.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.200
- Yes.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.333
- And the audience is great
'cause we shoot it here

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.500
and the audience stays and they
get to enjoy a whole lot of it.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.600
So the audience has been great
and people have been loving it,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.833
so hopefully ABC picks up
another season.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:31.233
You can catch the season finale
of "Repeat After Me" tonight

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.266
at 8:30 on ABC.
