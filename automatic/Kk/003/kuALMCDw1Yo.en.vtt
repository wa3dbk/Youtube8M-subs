00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.570
 it's Saturday morning we qualified 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 for the final Thursday night we have and we 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.439
 manages so today it's off again from 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.760
 the training we know recognize all 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.289
 go all the way ah it's finally 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.519
 we did not dare think about it too much I thought 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.720
 always been a little taboo in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.640
 cloakroom 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 really it was a pretty enough series 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 emotionally difficult that's good 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.640
 it ended well but it did not 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 been easy every game so is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.850
 now we are happy but we are here 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 where you long letter 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.140
 here I think we see there is also 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 players who stand out think and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 the more I think we see in the image of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.559
 bykov for example that is right 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 extraordinary canso if we yield 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 in front of picks it goes through 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.120
 moments like that it goes through 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 individualities too I think it's this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.940
 who makes the difference this year 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.949
 the atmosphere in this team it's just 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 extraordinary I think it shows 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.739
 especially on the ice for 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.879
 spectators for for everyone the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.480
 journalists everyone sees that a 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.400
 little outside 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.170
 and that's good cohesion sees that a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.119
 solidarity one every day we are here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 for really for to have fun for 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.119
 to spend a moment we rejoice the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.770
 rink to see what's going on 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.710
 pass today I believe it's 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 quite unique in a leather team 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 lives extraordinary moments we have 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 lived a great season by finishing 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.510
 first we lived the cut spengler all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.710
 together now alive his tears 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
 just they are just magic so 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.369
 it's a year really 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.759
 striking is a group really 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.759
 really extraordinary 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.899
 the coach is really going to be there all 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.300
 the days to really heal the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.560
 every detail to let everyone know 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.149
 exactly what he has to ask of 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 final and I think it's really going 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.399
 to be the daily until Thursday 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399
 next 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.610
 we will review it and then escalates 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.490
 in a video at 10 am I think we're going 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.259
 watch a little bit of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.640
 what went well - last year 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.439
 in the last very direct match 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 discuss a little bit the final it's 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.869
 because it's a preparation too 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.590
 mental than physical 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.590
 it's clear 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.489
 his audience during the match of 17h is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.709
 just amazing I think even the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.909
 penny on the bench while I was in 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.260
 the other match was the most important 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.879
 we did not really care if we 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.980
 it is there relates is carried by part 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.379
 confident but really it was magic 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.099
 games in an atmosphere like that 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.329
 while arsenal it was already 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.220
 extraordinary in the semifinals 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.390
 even better so I do not even dare 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.629
 imagine what it's going to give in the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.629
 final
