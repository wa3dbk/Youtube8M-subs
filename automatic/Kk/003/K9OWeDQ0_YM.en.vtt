 You notice that the remote lights are only on the left and right area because there is a car from the front 

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.125
 The far lights in the right grass area immediately die avoiding the glare of the front car 

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.931
 The far and right lights far back light up automatically 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.540
 The headlights far in the middle immediately die because there is a car in front 

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:43.023
 While the far lights are dead, the right area immediately dies because it will cross again 

00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:55.277
 Slowly the right area immediately flashes back 

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:14.504
 Overtaking and the far middle lights are immediately on
