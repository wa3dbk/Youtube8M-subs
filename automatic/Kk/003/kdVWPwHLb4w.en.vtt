it's usually the stem to the branch is
rather<00:01:57.829> short<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.990> first<00:02:00.229> thing<00:02:00.409> you'll

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

is about half a liter that I'm putting

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.070 
is about half a liter that I'm putting
in<00:02:10.009> there<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.549> know<00:02:10.750> more<00:02:11.750> or<00:02:11.900> less

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080

what<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> measurements<00:02:12.980> are<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.680> am<00:02:15.890> going

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
what the measurements are and I am going

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.970 
what the measurements are and I am going
