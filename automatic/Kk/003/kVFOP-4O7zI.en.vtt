00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.800
 good evening and welcome to side side that nenni komlosi increase of 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.520
 life expectancy or return to a form of conviviality as much 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.110
 of arguments that push some families stop in day for him the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.529
 grouped guitar 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.199
 the principle is simple several people to households decide to 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.339
 group together and share a pleasant terrain with the aim of 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.659
 develop a life project how 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.829
 why do we decide to live in a grouped habitat how 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.949
 organize community life 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.069
 an investigation started the exact charcoal of gerÃ©rard balinziala same 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.540
 that she is and the rock scene 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.830
 a quiet corner of Walloon Brabant 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.920
 a scene his voice of voters at a place close to the first hotel f1 team 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.390
 ferrari that almost became a subdivision 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 was bought five years ago by a handful of families 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.370
 a more supportive habitat 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.270
 that of laurence these seafarers 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.150
 today these great players but it's not just me 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.240
 a new house 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.480
 it's also the beginning 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.950
 a new adventure 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.870
 the boss we're in 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.570
 there are days when it's a bit of a culmination it's a lot a lot 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.630
 of energy and finally 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.360
 a lot of satisfaction do not know 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.760
 the project coming here to live 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.930
 well is first of all it's the power and stretch of six families of not being able 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.590
 I feel a lot of usability in any case 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.400
 we have just brussels so it's true that so fast spinning cdt but 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.390
 still cold enough 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.430
 and conclude in fact have something more user-friendly 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 more complete more collective 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 at home martine finishes are to be completed and the move 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 have just taken place 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.860
 entrance the centrist 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.930
 the health 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.520
 Martine and her husband 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 we joined the project following a small announcement grouped housing seeks 6th 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 families to share land 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.310
 intrigued they made contact 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.939
 and the current has passed 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.450
 right now she confuse us or is an actor in the country we want to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.099
 do things together 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.910
 activities 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.199
 and percent 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.879
 12:40 a look a common part but everyone will have his first name 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:23.369
 reagent 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.989
 but together we are stronger in fact 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.989
 we personally I would never have done 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.740
 still going on reading about homes and kids thinking about it 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.809
 actually quite 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.650
 so it's voters poetry his voice is not a stranger in the 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.909
 recipe and head of wood happiness and then we wait for the cash purchase 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.529
 help those who love it why 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.529
 because that's because the character is now and what voice 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 among the friends at the base of the idea 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.530
 the ground that the six trucks dropped counts more or less 130 da 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.680
 enough to preserve the space available for children 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.739
 middle School 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.079
 for the animals 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.839
 we can hen orchards gardens of his peers 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.129
 and so shaqiri six houses for constructions one is clearly at the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.359
 road and then common house that is not blamed on the roads 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.149
 more a natural extension 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.659
 the family home 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.269
 every house has its own private garden 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.480
 wood frame and natural materials was noted here for eco-construction 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.510
 between the birth of the project and the end of the project five years last year five 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.359
 years of discussion thinking research everything has been decided in this 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:31.919
 meaning 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
 it's going ahead 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.889
 it was a big expenditure of energy spent these five years 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:42.390
 meeting 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.310
 we are every week on friday night see 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.459
 some weeks to see three meetings 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.819
 to choose architects trades% is not at all 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.839
 obvious couple is not obvious then you put in a troop 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.359
 muted dlamini 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.509
 it makes things even more complex than you see in a project 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.929
 killer 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.109
 difficult 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.109
 energy-intensive in terms of human resources 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.589
 as for their quarterly 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.089
 I mean we are all we all want to get socially involved 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.309
 of social movements to the victim around us and the habitat grouped us 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.769
 brings a lot of things because we are all a little bit 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.180
 it's architect Michel Frisian different surfaces finishing each 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.279
 so according to his budget 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.729
 but we know that fire 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.069
 250000 your favorite people 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.400
 it is rare that the areas 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.520
 we have to turn around them 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.680
 ford made strong 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.259
 as for the background of the busy 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.229
 following this difficult meeting 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.419
 do not empty your hands 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.419
 it's always the same with me in fact things 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.949
 the buzz 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.380
 stephanie him it's downright launched in self-construction with 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.379
 100% ecological materials 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.879
 for electricity heating wall ceilinging only partitions they have everything 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.199
 install with sarah safari 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.229
 she decided to dedicate bringing of her life to build her elected home 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.479
 work every day 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.309
 and when we look at what the overall budget we realize that 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.580
 but the general business saturated- drink 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.289
 plumbing and 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.460
 in edf the dangerous ground movements society of its close rate 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.240
 from here 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.750
 and then that's what he does also contributed john mensah region but 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.949
 also anne reduction 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.710
 the ecological footprint 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.130
 the six communes of the project is to live and to build while thinking 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.420
 sustainable development in staging 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.150
 the energy consumer 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
 in a place favoring more friendly human relations 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.789
 in the common house he will have meetings of activities this is where 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.300
 also we find the cogeneration system that will provide heating 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.300
 hot water and electricity or this house 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.180
 so this site machine after primary function of products of struggles of 

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:04.800
 produces electricity 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.240
 initially city gas 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.779
 here in the street 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.459
 and him the excess heat and recover elyette used for 

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:15.989
 produce hot water just now you said in the heating system 

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:18.119
 different houses 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.960
 access to justice mans 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.430
 dd if I am a mix amortized relatively quickly we speak between 5 and 7 years 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.859
 to the extent that the files that is not used and fed back into 

00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:29.990
 the network 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.599
 having resold to the intermunicipal 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.550
 everyone owns his house 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.430
 and from his land the rest is part of a condominium in the coma costs 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.430
 are divided in six years this is for the legal aspect 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:43.860
 the baffin berry 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.360
 footprint cohabit in the same space 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.009
 but normally he is the seeker of the interior 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.509
 which defines a little 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.409
 in e minute the rules of life nor outclassed all that we are in the process 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:57.449
 to speak to an end 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.360
 this court of accounts is questioning 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.279
 since they created their dream 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.249
 ten other projects have emerged small tips to candidates ready to get 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:06.270
 launch 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.759
 I think that first and foremost 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.039
 the researcher took place 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.580
 it will be my main thing is not to seek to recruit people 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.419
 to find families started to abdou three families but first 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.789
 searched for a place they are around that I dream what 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.870
 but also an ounce one meets difficult
