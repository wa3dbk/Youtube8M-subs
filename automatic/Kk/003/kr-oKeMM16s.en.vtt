00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.570
 this video is dedicated to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.700
 you can not imagine this video is dedicated to 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.680
 jhon freddy who subscribed to my channel 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.860
 and he asked me how to do a kick 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.779
 540 The first thing I did was to investigate 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.230
 what is a 540 kick and why is it 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.050
 flame 540 it turns out that one hundred and eighty 180 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.390
 one hundred 360 takes a complete turn and 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 after 180 more than 540 or so there are 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.590
 to go one more lap 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.170
 round and a half to make that kick 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.610
 I knew it and I still do not get it right 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.800
 I'm learning, let's see the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.570
 attempts let's see it we try it 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.870
 decipher the kick and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.180
 they come here 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.760
 my friend Luis practiced from when 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 a bread taught me a kick that's called 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 pichincha please 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.370
 that exact then studying that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.690
 kick I realized that they are 360 ​​degrees 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.640
 because it is 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.600
 at the same level it does not work out as I expect 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.690
 more or less like that then true 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.050
 we discover that if we just remove the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.840
 dry leg from before and we can get to 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.260
 be the 540 or so we're going to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.260
 boost 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.740
 and we can also save a little bit of the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 course 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.770
 like this and now what more or less 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 we can kick our 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.590
 partner 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 national champion of our country 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.690
 then we will be a sample the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.110
 has never practiced is for dictated 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.940
 540 but based on the fact that it's the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.860
 same kick that they do by removing a 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.840
 stand more on your first try and go to 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.259
 be recorded for posterity louis 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.259
 please 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.179
 let's go a couple of tries 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.780
 I follow please 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.040
 louis will win me because after 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.040
 falling from the 540 makes another kick 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 please 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.550
 let's see let's pause what do you think 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.060
 first time they try this silver of 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.980
 540 what do you think is the level of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.470
 difficulty how long do you think it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.710
 It will take time to perfect this trick 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.890
 is moving well I think that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.220
 people here this even this 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.680
 partner who has been practicing for years 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.650
 different martial arts a kick no 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.140
 matter from what level it is always carried 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.700
 time can develop it does not matter no 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.220
 matter the skills that the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.940
 people this kick I think for 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.980
 develop it with perfect definition and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.440
 being able to hit with them would take 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.650
 a year to be able to develop and to be able 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.410
 apply with enemies and to do 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.720
 only the switching to make it the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.490
 movement without without hitting only 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.050
 to go to the disk and do the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.500
 move how long you want 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.610
 what moves 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.160
 good would take maybe 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.140
 let's put a month is a luck and you 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.230
 the movement leaves a month because it does not 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.080
 you need good balance of the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.080
 elasticity needs strength to not 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.900
 fall you do not drop more limit of support and 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.850
 several several as it is called need 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.160
 several steps to follow to be able 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.780
 develop fine excellent excellent me 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.930

 the practical stay when and this kick 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.890
 what are we doing 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 It carries movements that sometimes succeeded 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.650
 recognize but he just deciphered us 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.690
 all all the things that we should 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.760
 practice electricity force 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.680
 then we go to a few attempts 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.100
 more and I hope you like to subscribe 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.100
 please 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.009
 high times 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:05:07.950
 being plant and it takes seven minutes of 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:09.600
 practice and you do not get the guts that what 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.900
 we're going to censor because if it's not going to 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.740
 scare jhon freddy do not worry no 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.740
 you'll spend it 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.610
 So now we have seen how it works 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.770
 about 7 minutes of practice 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.990
 first time he does I also the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.419
 I just learned thanks to me 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.810
 he did not ask us for the explanation of that 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.700
 kick then let's join our ours 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.860
 minds right now 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.560
 louis explain how the skin is made 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.560
 as we are Christians and wide 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:52.029
 it's practically a 360 kick 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.029
 degrees always with turn in the hip 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.390
 knee 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.230
 which is what makes him figure in the 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.230
 next kick 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.370
 things do not unite our mind and 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.910
 analyzing the 540 a similar kick to 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.880
 the pool in which the body does not go so 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.540
 straight as this is how that kick what 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.200
 we are going to be here a little 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.820
 that way it's fine it does not come here 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.860
 with the hip 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.590
 and this shows it with all the force that 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.100
 It takes all the strength to make you 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.290
 turn around and this knee does not 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.180
 has to fall that's the goal that this 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.630
 knee I will not fall comes with Chinese 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.630
 I'm going to do it 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.199
 after making several several kicks 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.560
 exterior variant I never can not see 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:54.389

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:59.669
 360 so I apologize for the clients
