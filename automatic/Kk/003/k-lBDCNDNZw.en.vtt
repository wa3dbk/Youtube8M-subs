00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey sex people today I'm going to show

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.740 
hey sex people today I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.190> much<00:00:02.340> faster<00:00:02.580> way<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.939> duplicate<00:00:03.480> water

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
you a much faster way to duplicate water

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.460 
you a much faster way to duplicate water
in<00:00:03.990> 1.2<00:00:04.589> with<00:00:04.830> wired<00:00:05.069> pumps<00:00:06.259> 31.1<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
in 1.2 with wired pumps 31.1 it is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.440 
in 1.2 with wired pumps 31.1 it is
possible<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.950> duplicate<00:00:08.490> water<00:00:08.730> by<00:00:08.970> placing

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
possible to duplicate water by placing

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650 
possible to duplicate water by placing
the<00:00:09.540> outlet<00:00:09.870> pumps<00:00:10.260> like<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> after<00:00:11.880> 1.1

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the outlet pumps like this and after 1.1

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270 
the outlet pumps like this and after 1.1
pumping<00:00:13.139> water<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.769> over<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.070> pump

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
pumping water up and over the pump

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.770 
pumping water up and over the pump
itself<00:00:14.639> cost<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.120> small<00:00:15.269> amount<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
itself cost a small amount of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
itself cost a small amount of
duplication<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.770> still<00:00:17.039> works<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
duplication this still works but is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
duplication this still works but is
duplicated<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.570> around<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> point<00:00:19.289> where<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
duplicated at around the point where it

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.359 
duplicated at around the point where it
leaves<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> outlet<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.150> slow

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
leaves the outlet so it's really slow

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.830 
leaves the outlet so it's really slow
but<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.519> also<00:00:23.670> possible<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.359> duplicate

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
but it's also possible to duplicate

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.570 
but it's also possible to duplicate
water<00:00:25.080> while<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.320> flowing<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.369> running

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
water while it's flowing just by running

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
water while it's flowing just by running
it<00:00:26.730> down<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.029> 45-degree<00:00:27.779> jagged<00:00:28.140> slope<00:00:28.410> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it down in 45-degree jagged slope for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
it down in 45-degree jagged slope for
example<00:00:29.250> here's<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.640> bucket<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> water<00:00:30.359> being

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
example here's one bucket of water being

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
example here's one bucket of water being
released<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.740> collect<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
released and you can collect one and a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.200 
released and you can collect one and a
half<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> bottom

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.540 

so<00:00:38.840> building<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.260> small<00:00:39.500> Tower<00:00:39.710> like<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.190> you

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
so building a small Tower like this you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.520 
so building a small Tower like this you
can<00:00:40.730> double<00:00:40.850> your<00:00:41.120> water<00:00:41.300> pretty<00:00:41.600> quickly<00:00:41.900> if

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
can double your water pretty quickly if

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.410 
can double your water pretty quickly if
I<00:00:42.650> block<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.040> up<00:00:43.100> like<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:43.580> then<00:00:43.910> place<00:00:44.180> one

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
I block it up like this then place one

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.390 
I block it up like this then place one
block<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.840> war<00:00:45.080> you'll<00:00:45.440> see<00:00:45.680> it<00:00:45.830> takes<00:00:46.070> half<00:00:46.280> a

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
block of war you'll see it takes half a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.980 
block of war you'll see it takes half a
block<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.910> when<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.210> trickles<00:00:47.540> back<00:00:47.750> down

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
block and when it trickles back down

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.830 
block and when it trickles back down
it's<00:00:48.260> produced<00:00:48.650> two<00:00:48.890> full<00:00:49.130> blocks<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.580> water

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.720 

so<00:00:56.440> it's<00:00:56.590> really<00:00:56.770> easy<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.190> put<00:00:57.340> two<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.640> these

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
so it's really easy to put two of these

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.580 
so it's really easy to put two of these
back-to-back<00:00:58.000> with<00:00:58.570> criss-cross<00:00:58.809> pumps<00:00:59.440> and

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
back-to-back with criss-cross pumps and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.500 
back-to-back with criss-cross pumps and
double<00:00:59.829> it<00:00:59.920> again<00:01:00.010> I've<00:01:00.640> also<00:01:00.789> set<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.210> pumps

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
double it again I've also set the pumps

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.209 
double it again I've also set the pumps
up<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:01.809> do<00:01:01.930> pour<00:01:02.170> at<00:01:02.289> this<00:01:02.440> time<00:01:02.680> just<00:01:02.890> for<00:01:03.100> that

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
up to do pour at this time just for that

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.719 
up to do pour at this time just for that
tiny<00:01:03.519> boost<00:01:03.879> in<00:01:04.030> efficiency<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:06.220> we<00:01:06.369> block<00:01:06.549> it

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
tiny boost in efficiency if we block it

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.820 
tiny boost in efficiency if we block it
up<00:01:06.820> as<00:01:07.000> before<00:01:07.180> turn<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> pump<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.500> let<00:01:08.680> it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
up as before turn on the pump and let it

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.800 
up as before turn on the pump and let it
run<00:01:08.950> its<00:01:09.009> course<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.820> get<00:01:10.030> almost<00:01:10.330> 5<00:01:10.570> full

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
run its course you get almost 5 full

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.840 
run its course you get almost 5 full
blocks<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.290> water<00:01:11.500> back

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.300 

it<00:01:20.630> doesn't<00:01:20.960> look<00:01:21.049> terribly<00:01:21.590> economical

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
it doesn't look terribly economical

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.310 
it doesn't look terribly economical
space-wise<00:01:22.850> but<00:01:23.210> because<00:01:23.570> water<00:01:23.780> continues

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
space-wise but because water continues

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.050 
space-wise but because water continues
to<00:01:24.350> duplicate<00:01:24.950> as<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:25.280> flowing<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.820> can<00:01:25.970> hold

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
to duplicate as it's flowing it can hold

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.870 
to duplicate as it's flowing it can hold
the<00:01:26.240> deceptive<00:01:26.720> amount<00:01:27.369> plus<00:01:28.369> since<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
the deceptive amount plus since the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.249 
the deceptive amount plus since the
water<00:01:29.060> line<00:01:29.270> will<00:01:29.450> never<00:01:29.570> reach<00:01:29.869> certain

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
water line will never reach certain

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.870 
water line will never reach certain
points<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.680> can<00:01:30.920> make<00:01:31.130> doors<00:01:31.369> right<00:01:31.640> through

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
points you can make doors right through

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.430 
points you can make doors right through
it<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.180> easy<00:01:32.240> maintenance<00:01:32.570> escape<00:01:33.259> or

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
it for easy maintenance escape or

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.200 
it for easy maintenance escape or
passage<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.310> water<00:01:34.490> lines<00:01:34.729> right<00:01:35.000> back

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
passage and the water lines right back

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.789 
passage and the water lines right back
in<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.450> pump<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.049> can<00:01:36.200> start<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.590> thing

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
in the pump so you can start the thing

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.109 
in the pump so you can start the thing
off<00:01:36.950> with<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.220> single<00:01:37.460> bucket<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:38.000> water<00:01:40.119> here's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
off with a single bucket of water here's

off with a single bucket of water here's
the<00:01:41.270> wiring<00:01:41.659> is<00:01:41.840> pretty<00:01:42.200> simple<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.159> bottom

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the wiring is pretty simple the bottom

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
cutters and remove the bottom actuator

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.590 
cutters and remove the bottom actuator
so<00:02:06.980> has<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.310> flow<00:02:07.490> over<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.730> single<00:02:07.970> block<00:02:08.300> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
so has to flow over a single block and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.630 
so has to flow over a single block and
leave<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.960> drainage<00:02:09.290> open<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:10.340> should<00:02:10.520> be

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
leave the drainage open there should be

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.160 
leave the drainage open there should be
just<00:02:10.820> enough<00:02:11.090> water<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.540> continue<00:02:11.810> pumping
