00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.450
 welcome to neurology 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 I am the biologist and I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 never coming would be a fight with a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.369
 chimpanzee or a gorilla 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 today we will find out what really 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 would happen with tarzan if it were 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.960
 created by animals within the history of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.480
 edgar rice burroughs at the beginning of the century 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.179
 20 Tarzan's parents were shipwrecked in the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 coast of Africa had their son and 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.469
 shortly after they died when he had 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 about one year when it was adopted by 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.690
 fictional monkeys that became gorillas in the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.200
 disney movie and grew up without contact 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 human 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.730
 now how that child would be and what 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 would be their interaction with people who 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.989
 I met her later . 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.940
 there were not few wild children like 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.430
 the kamala sisters and the suitcase 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.829
 created in isolation these two were 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 allegedly rescued from a pack 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.379
 of wolves and educated by a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.930
 India in 1920 with the douglas candy land 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 Tell A Friend 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.090
 story very similar to mobile plot 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.640
 The problem is supposedly because in the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.320
 most of the old reports are in doubt 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.509
 if the children really grew up 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 isolated from humanity or have grown 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.110
 in a normal environment and had some 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 type of development problem 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.830
 mental as dandruff house victor 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.570
 summer 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.729
 to this day we discuss whether they really 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.140
 grew isolated and therefore had 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.450
 difficulty of communication and a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 less civilized behavior or if the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 their past was invented and they had 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.079
 some sort of mental retardation like 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.119
 severe autism a true case of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.549
 girl dini that gives a sense of how 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.930
 tarzan would be when the genius met the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 daughter of a mother with mental disorders 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.299
 and an abusive father johnny grew up in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.670
 angels locked alone in a room of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 a little more than a year and a half of age until 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.219
 13 years in 1970 for having grown up 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 almost without any human contact 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.469
 Johnny did not know how to speak or 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.119
 communication skills up to your 17 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.070
 she was raised with the help of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.920
 psychologists and researchers 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.780
 even so he only learned a few words 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.239
 some principles of sign language 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.410
 and has developed very little capacity 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.000
 of communication 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.980
 we have a critical period for 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.050
 learn to speak as a period in which 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.820
 chicks or duck puppies learn to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.920
 follow any large objects that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.320
 move and lasts a few days after 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.970
 they come out of the egg and then end our 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.130
 the first years of life are the period 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.740
 critical for learning to speak 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.000
 closes in adolescence so it becomes 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.640
 It's harder to learn a new language. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.710
 as we age and the languages ​​we 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.750
 we learn after adolescence are 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.310
 usually accented with an accent 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.070
 after that period our learning 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 language is more time-consuming and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 more difficult and we lose our accent 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.820
 while Johnny had a lot of trouble 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.900
 to communicate after 13 years 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.300
 mainly because it did not have nearly 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.790
 no social interaction steven pinker 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 com has the instinct of language about 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.810
 a girl who has been abused 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.210
 and escaped from the bondage of his 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.340
 grandfather, six and a half years old 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.200
 for being so young and still close to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 critical period has learned the language 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
 usually the tarzan 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.190
 with a little more than a year and grew 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.410
 isolated until adulthood he does not 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.750
 I would understand what the books that 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.880
 he found it difficult to learn the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.440
 speak more than a few words and 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.380
 as jeannie probably 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.510
 communicated better by simple gestures in the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.880
 we would hear the cry of the king of 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.459
 jungle as it circulates vines but 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.010
 nothing of me tarzan you n 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.290
 and worse the teacher hiroyuki shima 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.030
 university of anache has shown that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.130
 calculation involved in determining the best 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.890
 point for the tarzan southall cipó for 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.290
 jumping away is very complex he 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.060
 need to take into account the speed 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.410
 body position and distance from the ground 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.390
 size of the vine 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.000
 so the cry of him must be of sorrow 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.370
 and it is not just the communication of 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 tarzan do move that would be compromised 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.590
 they could have abstraction the notion of 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.900
 time as we see each other with animals 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.090
 extremely intelligent 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.310
 abstraction planning and a series of 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.200
 others, but we do not think that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.880
 much of it comes from our culture 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.250
 and our language 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.290
 in the excellent book comes from oliver voices 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.989
 sacks talks about people who are born without 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.060
 hearing and are not diagnosed until well 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.280
 late as a deaf boy called 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.169
 joseph who grew up without language or 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.639
 literacy until the age of 11 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.560
 He even learned the language. 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.680
 nice but did not know what a 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.689
 question and as dini neither had 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.439
 notion of abstract time as the day of 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.840
 tomorrow 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.189
 our capacity for abstraction as the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.979
 notion of time that things 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.020
 place an order that the future one day 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.990
 tomorrow we will have hoverboard today 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.219
 geology will have 10 million subscribers 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.499
 depends on our language and 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.629
 interaction with other 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:54.029
 people when you talk about the cat 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.680
 is the context of the conversation that 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.550
 let you abstract a happy is a lot 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.099
 beautiful 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.960
 an ill-treated animal in the hand of felicity 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.560
 besides probably not being able to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.330
 speak 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.250
 tarzan would only have a sense that it is 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.439
 human being and could have thoughts 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.449
 more complex if you learn to 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.740
 communicate with the genii and learn a 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.719
 new language 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.000
 other hearing impaired person who 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.770
 mentally disabled person and the 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.099
 The deceased only learned the language of 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.889
 signs at age 27 and as susan geller 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.229
 in the documentary book a - auto 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.050
 workers and the fantastic episode of 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.909
 podcast radioweb only after learning to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.949
 sign language he was able to have 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.759
 abstract thoughts and understand the world 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.129
 around you 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.080
 even in the best of scenarios 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.250
 in which he could speak well and 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.050
 win the n 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.050
 she would still have to deal with stripe with 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.180
 teeth closed fleas lice in one 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.919
 world of intestinal parasites that it 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.949
 would have contracted to eat raw meat for 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.149
 all life life in the jungle is not easy 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.629
 do not forget to enjoy and share 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:56.159
 The video orders me to sign the channel and 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.439

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.189
 Thank you again andré sousa for
