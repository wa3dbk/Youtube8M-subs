reward<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.940> we<00:00:50.750> were<00:00:50.899> able<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.260> identify<00:00:51.760> the

reward is we were able to identify the

this<00:00:55.750> patterning<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.989> pigmentation<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.629> we

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
this patterning of pigmentation and we

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.619 
this patterning of pigmentation and we
were<00:00:59.809> able<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.469> show<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.309> two<00:01:01.820> signals<00:01:02.329> are

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
were able to show that two signals are

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.290 
were able to show that two signals are
combined<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:04.040> where<00:01:04.250> they<00:01:04.370> intersected<00:01:05.090> then

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
combined and where they intersected then

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.450 
combined and where they intersected then
you've<00:01:05.480> got<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.050> production<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.770> red<00:01:06.980> pigment

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
you've got the production of red pigment

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.900 
you've got the production of red pigment

decided to set up field experiments we

decided to set up field experiments we
set<00:01:29.900> up<00:01:29.930> plots<00:01:30.350> which<00:01:30.620> compared<00:01:31.160> full<00:01:31.850> red

with lines that had the variation
patterning<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:35.840> then<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:37.300> employed<00:01:38.300> students

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
patterning and then we employed students

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.730 
patterning and then we employed students
on<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.380> field

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.960 
bees went in their visitations to the
flowers<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.540> we<00:01:47.660> found<00:01:47.900> that<00:01:48.020> these<00:01:48.550> like<00:01:49.550> the

flowers so we found that these like the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.810 
flowers so we found that these like the
full<00:01:50.300> red<00:01:50.540> varieties<00:01:51.230> much<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.830> than<00:01:52.190> white

or ivory or pale pink varieties however

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.330 
or ivory or pale pink varieties however
when<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.750> did<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.350> did<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.650> comparisons

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
when you did that we did the comparisons

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.550 
when you did that we did the comparisons
with<00:01:58.700> foot<00:01:59.030> between<00:01:59.270> full<00:01:59.750> red<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.260> the

with foot between full red and the
stripey<00:02:00.950> venation<00:02:01.640> patterning<00:02:02.330> then<00:02:02.960> we

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
stripey venation patterning then we

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.310 
stripey venation patterning then we
found<00:02:03.290> no<00:02:03.530> significant<00:02:04.250> difference<00:02:05.320> perhaps

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
found no significant difference perhaps

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.520 
found no significant difference perhaps
planting<00:02:07.160> either<00:02:07.640> these<00:02:08.060> brightly<00:02:08.989> colored

it's<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.470> more<00:02:14.069> advantageous<00:02:14.480> in

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it's going to be more advantageous in

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.199 
it's going to be more advantageous in
attracting<00:02:15.900> bees<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.640> would<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
attracting bees and so that would be a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.320 
attracting bees and so that would be a
good<00:02:18.510> tip<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.700> for<00:02:20.700> gardeners<00:02:21.090> who<00:02:21.209> are

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
good tip for for gardeners who are

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.620 
good tip for for gardeners who are
thinking<00:02:21.480> about<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:21.930> they<00:02:21.990> want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.319> grow
