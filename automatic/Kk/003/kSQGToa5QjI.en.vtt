clamps fine I'm going to show you kind

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.180 
clamps fine I'm going to show you kind
of<00:00:55.390> how<00:00:55.479> to<00:00:55.540> assemble<00:00:55.900> this<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.530> parts<00:00:56.830> I<00:00:56.949> use

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
of how to assemble this the parts I use

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.660 
of how to assemble this the parts I use
there's<00:00:58.089> a<00:00:58.150> lull<00:00:58.949> fabrication<00:00:59.949> involved<00:01:00.460> as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
there's a lull fabrication involved as

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.020 
there's a lull fabrication involved as
far<00:01:00.970> as<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.600> little<00:01:02.140> welding<00:01:02.409> on<00:01:03.100> just<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.879> base

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
far as a little welding on just the base

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.530 
far as a little welding on just the base
plate<00:01:04.330> here<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.430> have<00:01:06.640> access<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.360> or

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
plate here if you have access to that or

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.390 
plate here if you have access to that or
you<00:01:07.570> probably<00:01:07.900> find<00:01:08.200> another<00:01:08.500> way<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.770> do<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.040> I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
you probably find another way to do it I

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.120 
you probably find another way to do it I
found<00:01:09.820> this<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.119> be<00:01:10.150> really<00:01:10.240> good<00:01:10.630> for<00:01:10.840> my<00:01:11.130> my

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
found this to be really good for my my

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.030 
found this to be really good for my my
setup<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:12.700> anyway<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:14.409> might<00:01:14.680> be<00:01:14.830> in<00:01:14.950> a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
setup so anyway this might be in a

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.790 
setup so anyway this might be in a
couple<00:01:15.369> videos<00:01:16.320> might<00:01:17.320> be<00:01:17.440> more<00:01:17.620> than<00:01:17.740> one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
couple videos might be more than one

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.650 
couple videos might be more than one
only<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.910> might<00:01:19.150> get<00:01:19.330> kind<00:01:19.540> of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
only because it might get kind of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.960 
only because it might get kind of
lengthy<00:01:20.050> but<00:01:20.800> I'm<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.220> try<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.490> keep<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
lengthy but I'm going to try to keep it

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.320 
lengthy but I'm going to try to keep it
short<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.780> sweet<00:01:22.930> as<00:01:23.170> possible<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.330> yeah
