no fingerprints and no dust these are I

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.569 
no fingerprints and no dust these are I
think<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.079> best<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.129> back<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.489> would

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
think the best have it back you would

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.789 
think the best have it back you would
have<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.819> case<00:02:42.239> not<00:02:42.569> plastic<00:02:43.049> not<00:02:43.109> silicone

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
have on case not plastic not silicone

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.229 
have on case not plastic not silicone
but<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.700> best<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.209> between<00:02:47.239> this

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
but it's the best of in between this

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.110 
but it's the best of in between this
case<00:02:48.629> does<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.829> not<00:02:50.010> most<00:02:50.579> protective

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
case does it it's not most protective

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.170 
case does it it's not most protective
case<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.810> will<00:02:52.290> protect<00:02:52.980> from<00:02:53.280> most<00:02:53.549> Falls<00:02:53.819> you
