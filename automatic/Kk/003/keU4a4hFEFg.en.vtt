00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.780 
said this front feels a little bit
squishy<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.560> protecting<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
squishy so that it's protecting the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.450 
squishy so that it's protecting the
front<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.360> phone<00:03:04.190> from<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:06.030> any<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
front of the phone from from any kind of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.330

damage<00:03:08.460> or<00:03:08.850> any<00:03:09.000> kind<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:10.140> know<00:03:10.920> something

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
damage or any kind of you know something

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.630 
damage or any kind of you know something
poking<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.970> something<00:03:12.510> along<00:03:12.600> those<00:03:12.960> lines<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
poking it something along those lines so

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.340 
poking it something along those lines so
overall<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.940> think<00:03:15.120> after<00:03:15.420> unboxing<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.200> this

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
overall I think after unboxing it this

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.170 
overall I think after unboxing it this
this<00:03:16.680> case<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.730> better<00:03:17.910> than<00:03:18.090> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
this case is a little better than I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.790 
this case is a little better than I
expected<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:19.290> got<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> little<00:03:19.590> bit

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
expected it to be it's got a little bit

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.770 
expected it to be it's got a little bit
more<00:03:19.920> form<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.340> little<00:03:20.550> bit<00:03:20.640> more<00:03:20.760> function<00:03:21.300> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
more form a little bit more function the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.440 
more form a little bit more function the
phone<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.170> easy<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.880> said<00:03:24.150> it
