00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
only difference is the sizing X's are

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460 
only difference is the sizing X's are
for<00:00:14.190> big<00:00:14.340> bikes<00:00:14.580> J's<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.660> mini<00:00:15.809> bikes<00:00:16.080> so

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
for big bikes J's are for mini bikes so

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.930 
for big bikes J's are for mini bikes so
the<00:00:16.770> construction<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.430> otherwise<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
whole thing now let's talk about where

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.580 
whole thing now let's talk about where
this<00:00:30.330> tire<00:00:30.570> fits<00:00:30.810> into<00:00:30.990> Pirellis<00:00:31.289> lineup

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this tire fits into Pirellis lineup

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.880 
this tire fits into Pirellis lineup
basically<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.700> five<00:00:33.000> tires<00:00:33.290> soft<00:00:34.290> mid

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
basically they have five tires soft mid

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.479 
basically they have five tires soft mid
soft<00:00:35.190> mid<00:00:35.760> hard<00:00:36.059> hard<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> X<00:00:37.710> now

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
soft mid hard hard and then the X now

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.000 
soft mid hard hard and then the X now
the<00:00:39.059> X<00:00:39.270> family<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.870> supposed<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> X

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the X family is supposed to or the X

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
the X family is supposed to or the X
tire<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.760> wear<00:00:42.149> longer<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> going

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
tire is going to wear longer it's going

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
tire is going to wear longer it's going
to<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> longer<00:00:43.530> lifespan<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:44.550> wear<00:00:44.760> down

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to have a longer lifespan not wear down

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
to have a longer lifespan not wear down
as<00:00:45.149> fast<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.600> also<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.469> sort<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
as fast it's also going to be sort of a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
as fast it's also going to be sort of a
catch-all<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> covers<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.910> wider<00:00:48.300> variety

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
catch-all so it covers a wider variety

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
catch-all so it covers a wider variety
of<00:00:48.899> terrain<00:00:49.320> types<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.250> includes<00:00:50.700> basically

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of terrain types that includes basically

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.260 
of terrain types that includes basically
mid<00:00:51.480> soft<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> hard<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.670> guys

that in mind now the way that these

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.770 
that in mind now the way that these
tires<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.470> constructed<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.790> MX<00:01:21.180> extra<00:01:21.600> X

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tires are constructed the MX extra X

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
tires are constructed the MX extra X
replaces<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> old<00:01:23.070> MX<00:01:23.640> extra<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
replaces the old MX extra I know it's a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.749 
replaces the old MX extra I know it's a
big<00:01:24.659> mouthful<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.130> tread<00:01:26.340> pattern<00:01:26.369> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
big mouthful but the tread pattern is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.190 
big mouthful but the tread pattern is
the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> look<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.840> very

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the same it's going to look very very

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.810 
the same it's going to look very very
similar<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> recognize<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
similar we're going to recognize this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
similar we're going to recognize this
what's<00:01:30.090> changed<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> extra<00:01:31.229> X<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
what's changed on the extra X is that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
what's changed on the extra X is that
it's<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.579> has<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> different<00:01:33.180> compound<00:01:33.630> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's now has a different compound so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's now has a different compound so
it's<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.799> hard<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.490> rubber<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.090> as

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's not as hard the rubber is not as

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
it's not as hard the rubber is not as
hard<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:36.600> means<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.590> slip

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hard which means it's not going to slip

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
hard which means it's not going to slip
on<00:01:38.130> hard<00:01:38.490> surfaces<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> chunk

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
on hard surfaces it's not going to chunk

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
on hard surfaces it's not going to chunk
off<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.530> either<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.829> longer<00:01:41.520> lifespan

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
off as much either so longer lifespan

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.310 
off as much either so longer lifespan
better<00:01:42.270> performance<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.960> we've<00:01:43.110> talked

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
better performance like we've talked

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.060 
better performance like we've talked
about<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
about you can see that it actually has a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.410 
about you can see that it actually has a
staggered<00:01:47.070> design<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:47.939> knobs<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
staggered design on the side knobs on

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
staggered design on the side knobs on
the<00:01:48.930> center<00:01:49.259> row<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:50.040> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the center row here these are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
the center row here these are
alternating<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.540> bowtie<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
alternating so you have a bowtie and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
alternating so you have a bowtie and
then<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> square<00:01:53.250> edge<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> bowtie<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
then a square edge and then a bowtie and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
then a square edge and then a bowtie and
then<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> square<00:01:55.049> edge<00:01:55.320> square<00:01:56.100> edges<00:01:56.399> are

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
then a square edge square edges are

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
then a square edge square edges are
great<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.909> braking<00:01:57.329> performance<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.990> bow

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
great for braking performance the bow

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.420 
great for braking performance the bow
ties<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.380> focused<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.219> on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
ties are focused a little bit more on

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
ties are focused a little bit more on
acceleration<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.360> consistent<00:02:01.290> performance

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
acceleration so consistent performance

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.990 
acceleration so consistent performance
all<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.009> around<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.549> talked<00:02:02.729> about<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
all the way around we talked about the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.310 
all the way around we talked about the
alternating<00:02:03.479> pattern<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.960> ultra

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
alternating pattern for ultra

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
alternating pattern for ultra
performance<00:02:04.860> left<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.060> side

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
performance left to right on your side

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.839 
performance left to right on your side
grip<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.069> because<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> compound<00:02:08.670> it's

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
grip and because of the compound it's

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.010 
grip and because of the compound it's
now<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> last<00:02:09.390> longer<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
now going to last longer which is a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
now going to last longer which is a
critical<00:02:10.560> factor<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.750> front<00:02:12.959> tire<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
critical factor so the front tire is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
critical factor so the front tire is
much<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.340> same<00:02:14.370> okay<00:02:14.880> different<00:02:15.450> tread

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
much the same okay different tread

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.930 
much the same okay different tread
pattern<00:02:15.930> obviously<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:16.530> same<00:02:16.890> concept<00:02:16.940> wider

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
pattern obviously but same concept wider

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.729 
pattern obviously but same concept wider
variety<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.510> terrain<00:02:18.930> longer-lasting

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
variety of terrain longer-lasting

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.890 
variety of terrain longer-lasting
performance<00:02:20.520> now<00:02:20.970> you're<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.630> here

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
performance now you're going to see here

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
performance now you're going to see here
that<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.410> great<00:02:22.739> spacing<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.340> between

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that it's got great spacing in between

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.699 
that it's got great spacing in between
so<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.060> softer<00:02:24.510> stuff<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.110> clean<00:02:25.380> itself

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so for softer stuff it will clean itself

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.800 
so for softer stuff it will clean itself
out<00:02:25.950> very<00:02:26.190> well<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.670> at<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> same<00:02:27.270> time<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
out very well and at the same time it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
out very well and at the same time it
has<00:02:28.020> enough<00:02:28.440> knobs<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.459> still<00:02:29.670> going

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
has enough knobs that it's still going
