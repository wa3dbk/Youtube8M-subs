00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 how about friends thank you for this new 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 play in this opportunity we are going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.760
 learn a key movement in fifa 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.070
 much more important than it seems 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 that will allow us to throw the ball 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.780
 forward at a greater distance than 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.289
 when we are running in a normal way 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.619
 and not only will it not lose speed but 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.080
 win it as in this case as you see in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 the background images in this way 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 we will prevent the players that we 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.460
 come chasing do not reach us and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.649
 we can even increase the distance if 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 the player with whom we made this 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.980
 movement has good speed like 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.920
 see the controls are very simple this 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.700
 movement only requires to be running 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 with the jog button pressed and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 automatically with the analog or r3 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.020
 press it in the direction where 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.510
 we want to perform the movement and throw 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.109
 the ball forward 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 this is all now let's see the examples 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 here we are with the first example in 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 this case the player is Suarez we throw 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 the ball giving his chance 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 forward which allows us to maintain 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.009
 a distance with the rival power 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 try to cross the ball from the other side 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.240
 before the arrival of Neymar and try to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 generate a dangerous situation that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.740
 happens very close in this new play the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.689
 the author / it is neymar is look like 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 we made the movement in several 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.549
 opportunities which allows us to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.830
 in this situation gambetear us to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 left lateral and then stretch a 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.539
 past center and return the ball towards 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.390
 in to be able to convert a goal 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.490
 with rakitic here a new move this 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 play is a clear example of what 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.530
 important that is to realize this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.539
 movement in certain situations 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 see how I'm almost the same 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.190
 height of the defenders at the time 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.440
 to cut the ball but look how 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.289
 once the ball arrived 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.869
 forward I can increase the 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.810
 distance with them and this allows me 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.780
 to be able to get in front of the goalkeeper much more 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.330
 comfortable and able to define in front of the first 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.850
 stick now is going to come the repetition and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 one last move where we are going to use 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.420
 this movement 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.120
 different I recommend that you take them 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.370
 Later in the practice arena notice 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.680
 this example as once we were 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.440
 hand in hand in front of the goalkeeper in this 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.750
 case with Suarez we can throw the long 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.420
 to one side and be able to define 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.070
 freely in front of the archer friends 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.890
