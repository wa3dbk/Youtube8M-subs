00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.319

to<00:03:17.099> verify<00:03:17.250> them<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:17.819> can<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.060> ahead<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
to verify them you can go ahead and

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.789 
to verify them you can go ahead and
check<00:03:18.510> them<00:03:18.690> too<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:18.900> double<00:03:19.349> check<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
check them too just double check and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.220 
check them too just double check and
make<00:03:19.889> sure<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.340> download<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.449> not<00:03:21.720> corrupted

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
make sure the download is not corrupted

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.930 
make sure the download is not corrupted
so<00:03:22.709> it'll<00:03:22.919> go<00:03:23.010> ahead<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.250> flash<00:03:23.430> your<00:03:23.459> kernel

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
so it'll go ahead and flash your kernel

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.949 
so it'll go ahead and flash your kernel
for<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:24.449> believe<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.840> will

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
for you and I believe it will

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.869 
for you and I believe it will
automatically<00:03:25.530> reboot<00:03:26.099> your<00:03:26.190> Epic<00:03:26.459> 4G<00:03:26.489> Touch

automatically reboot your Epic 4G Touch

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.300 
automatically reboot your Epic 4G Touch
once<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.109> done<00:03:28.260> flashing<00:03:28.739> looks<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.129> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
once it is done flashing looks like it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.539 
once it is done flashing looks like it
did<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.349> we<00:03:31.349> will<00:03:31.470> let<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.769> boot<00:03:31.919> up<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.310> should

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
did so we will let it boot up it should

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.900 
did so we will let it boot up it should
boot<00:03:33.150> back<00:03:33.329> up<00:03:33.510> normally<00:03:34.669> alright<00:03:35.669> so<00:03:35.819> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
boot back up normally alright so the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.939 
boot back up normally alright so the
phone<00:03:36.120> booted<00:03:36.449> up<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.900> fine<00:03:37.139> you'll<00:03:37.560> see<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
phone booted up just fine you'll see it

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.339 
phone booted up just fine you'll see it
is<00:03:38.069> loading<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.639> up<00:03:38.819> going<00:03:39.629> through<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.139> now

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
is loading on up going through but now

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.689 
is loading on up going through but now
we<00:03:40.410> are<00:03:40.769> gonna<00:03:41.010> want<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> check<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.579> that

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
we are gonna want to check out that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.920 
we are gonna want to check out that
custom<00:03:42.030> recovery<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:42.599> just<00:03:42.750> installed

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
custom recovery that we just installed

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.500 
custom recovery that we just installed
so<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.250> power<00:03:44.489> off<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:44.910> device<00:03:45.150> once

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
so we can just power off for device once

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.569 
so we can just power off for device once
again<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.109> we<00:03:46.260> will<00:03:46.440> need<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:47.010> reboot<00:03:47.340> into

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
again and we will need to reboot into

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.930 
again and we will need to reboot into
