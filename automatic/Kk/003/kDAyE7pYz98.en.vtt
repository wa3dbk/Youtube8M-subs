medication has approached this way it's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.690 
medication has approached this way it's
easier<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.960> avoid<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.530> confusion<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.280> comes

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
easier to avoid the confusion that comes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.730 
easier to avoid the confusion that comes
from<00:01:38.300> thinking<00:01:38.660> about<00:01:38.750> medications<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
from thinking about medications and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.870 
from thinking about medications and
general<00:01:40.190> classes<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.990> reason<00:01:42.410> that

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
general classes so the reason that

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.800 
general classes so the reason that
antipsychotics<00:01:43.880> are<00:01:44.030> used<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.600> treat

antipsychotics are used to treat

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.900 
antipsychotics are used to treat
depression<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.500> they're<00:01:46.160> not<00:01:46.340> just

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
depression is they're not just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.630 
depression is they're not just
antipsychotic<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:48.140> holds<00:01:48.620> true<00:01:48.830> for<00:01:48.860> many

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
antipsychotic this holds true for many

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.420 
antipsychotic this holds true for many
classes<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.330> psychiatric<00:01:50.810> medications<00:01:51.430> so

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
classes of psychiatric medications so

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.969 
classes of psychiatric medications so
when<00:01:52.820> working<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.360> your<00:01:53.390> doctor<00:01:53.800> focus<00:01:54.800> on<00:01:54.950> a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
particular medication find out what it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.040 
particular medication find out what it
can<00:01:57.890> do<00:01:58.190> find<00:01:59.030> out<00:01:59.210> what<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.509> side<00:01:59.720> effects

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
can do find out what the side effects

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.109 
can do find out what the side effects
are<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.190> can<00:02:01.369> make<00:02:01.550> an<00:02:01.670> informed

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
are and then you can make an informed

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.060 
are and then you can make an informed
decision<00:02:02.150> about<00:02:02.690> whether<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.320> makes<00:02:03.350> sense<00:02:03.830> to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
decision about whether it makes sense to

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.090 
decision about whether it makes sense to
