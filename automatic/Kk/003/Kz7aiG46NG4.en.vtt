00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.770
 one of the most important buying arguments 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.260
 a used car is next to the price 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.180
 the mileage cars the less 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.129
 kilometer on the tacho have achieved 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.880
 higher prices and get better 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.890
 Selling 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.589
 Experts estimate that the mileage 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.390
 every third used cars offered 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.390
 Germany has been manipulated 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.579
 the colloquial turning back of the 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.680
 Speedos is rarely discovered and so far 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.329
 there are no high penalties 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.940
 developed into a lucrative business 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.710
 while earlier the table with a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.690
 could turn back drilling machine 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.280
 today the mileage over one 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.870
 electronic plug connection 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.210
 be manipulated this connection is 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.129
 usually for the digital maintenance 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.620
 devices thought the workshops use around 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.100
 For example, read errors on the car 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.870
 can 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.520
 for a criminal expert it is 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.049
 a matter of seconds the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.329
 kilometers to be styled 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.680
 the technical equipment is there for it 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.509
 to buy on the internet 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.700
 press a few buttons and you're done 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.560
 the old used a car with little 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.890
 mileage that several thousand euros 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.810
 is worth more and the manipulated speedometer 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.040
 is at first glance as such 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 not recognizable 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.070
 That's why so many unsuspecting car buyers fall 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.070
 in it 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.170
 So he waits for all the inspections 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.800
 attended regular maintenance 80,000 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.070
 ran 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.170
 six years old convince think at 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.000
 best even if the test drive and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 This test drive should be used around 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.230
 to take a closer look is that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 Steering wheel heavily worn metal casting 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.550
 close or sit through the seats 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.860
 sat though the car relatively 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.510
 has run a few kilometers then is 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.340
 a certain skepticism announced 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.020
 These are markets tacho tricks can be 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.510
 but definitely discover them if they are 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.430
 experts note that at &amp; t 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.160
 recommends the vehicle buyer the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.990
 potential vehicle buyers themselves 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.550
 operating elements of the vehicle first 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.530
 to take a look at yourself also to take time 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.300
 compare with other cars 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.520
 The controls are about the same age 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.470
 give the most information about that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.720
 age of the vehicle that is 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
 Steering wheel is tapped switch 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 Pressed often pressed surfaces 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.360
 are damaged that naturally increases 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.420
 the older the car is here you can 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.310
 see if such aging still fits 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 to the kilometer reading is given 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.180
 in a second step, we recommend 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 to look at the vehicle history 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.170
 Vehicle history means you look 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.770
 Vehicle evidence to expect 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.620
 evidence of oil change evidence tÃ¼v evidence in 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.030
 the kilometers are stored off 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.890
 the history of the vehicle 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 it is understandable that this must be conclusive 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.209
 there are no breaks for this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.190
 would be on mileage changes 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.480
 point 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.550
 even if the seller is still like that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.840
 likable and honest acts is straight 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.190
 when buying a used car 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.230
 written contract important 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.420
 The seller should refuse the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
 Speedometer standard to keep you from 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.090
 the supposedly cheap used 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.520
 better the fingers 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.870
 and if they later find out 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.670
 that the mileage from the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.260
 purchase contract not the reality 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.700
 they still have the same 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.900
 possibility of legal against the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.900
 sellers proceed
