00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.870
 secrets tourias today I'll show you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 the secret headdress of cruz clear 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.090
 the npc semi down there and indeed it works 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.939
 not a secret room today or 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.330
 secret event but one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 headdress which you get for free 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.220
 can clothing for the city to there 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 in the iron marshes that is a field 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.149
 relatively far in the northeast of the world map 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.280
 and 50 to 60 he made iron marshes on 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 best start your off the mark 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 Fire Station That's that way 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 mark then you just run here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.520
 that way I ran to those 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.190
 new eyes grotten here on top of this 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.390
 rocky ledge so we're up here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.000
 and then you see down there namely the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.989
 the rhön rohr troop is what i believe 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.399
 these are mechanics in the war machine 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.619
 and repair the tank 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.180
 besides, we have to jump down so 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 just from down here 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 However, you can also of of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.640
 east you can come in here but from 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.530
 above simply jump down directly 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 the npcs the easiest of all 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.009
 then you will not arrive here 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.229
 any opponents over here in here 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.979
 this tunnel but right now 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.079
 there if you can talk to this npc 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 You ask if we maybe this pipe 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.280
 Of course, joining a squad may be possible 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.960
 you do not just kinda chart 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 He is clear to join throne 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.710
 but you have a small task for 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
 they have to be fulfilled and that is something to prove 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.670
 that one as well as the one good one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.500
 is mechanic and this armor here 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 that is broken and broken 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 if you fix it you become a member 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 the rhönklub I have here now too 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 in this video extra to another 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.369
 Character changed since the pro 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 Character only goes once and there I am 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.640
 already done with my main characters 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980
 I somehow had to do that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.510
 find out 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.280
 I had to go here on the other now 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.860
 Character I'll change that for you 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.630
 can show here 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.100
 we are talking to this mpc the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.060
 then explain it a bit like that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.410
 every workshop is and that the tropics 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.540
 Mission has repaired and tanks and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.310
 then he just says that the tank 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.320
 broken man should fix that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.180
 how exactly what you have here now 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.230
 I will not have to show you 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.040
 you can do that yourself 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.560
 find out 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 that's not really hard it is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.320
 various things will break then it will 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.710
 always shown above 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.440
 im what is broken and it is actually 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.110
 everything relative with logical 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.840
 common sense is this actually 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 it is not so easy to do 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.330
 bad if you know what wrong expresses its 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.790
 you just have to start over again 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.590
 but start that if you have a tank 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.260
 you do not want to fix that 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.800
 I believe everyone is against kicking 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.930
 clear 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.850
 so that's not how it is here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.740
 hard to make this tank completely me 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 will do this now and then see 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.910
 we turn right again armor 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.100
 it's all over again so you all have 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.959
 repairs done there is that 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.250
 vehicle is now fully functional 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.600
 You should inform us more clearly 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 that it is ready to go 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.680
 then we make that call then happy 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.620
 also have year in record time 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.670
 we made it here 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.080
 Blablabla can still be with you a bit 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.510
 the talk and you see we get 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.850
 here the headband the act of iron 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.800
 we can do it too 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.350
 then use change directly 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.790
 sportswear and have this here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.380
 Mechaniker gut looks quite funny 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.650
 nothing is extraordinary now 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.330
 special nevertheless something strange 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.820
 what not every player has since that one 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.620
 she has to find her first and for the rest 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.660
 just as new hat for the city 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.750
 clothes I think 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.240
 Nobody has any objection to it 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.580
 take any case and it pleased 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.680
 I give a couple of bugs with this cap 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.870
 I heard that at some sylvari 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.700
 Characteristics of the hat is not displayed 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.290
 but only with all other races 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.630
 but perhaps will then also 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.160
 fixed at some point and then you can too 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.080
 let the sylvari display that 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.640
 It does not matter, I say goodbye 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.549
 Definitely here with these words 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.870
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.940
 look forward to your new city ​​clothes 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.350
 and then we 'll just meet in the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.350
