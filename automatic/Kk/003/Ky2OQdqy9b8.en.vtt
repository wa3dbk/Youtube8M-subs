 how old were you when you started 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:27.180
 it was not easy to shoot videos 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 videos come up with many new ideas 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.600

 money youtube and how much money you spend on 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 there was a studio microphone berangere 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.440
 it is not difficult who imposed a thousand 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 rubles but it cost 3 500 and I worked 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.790
 somewhere around a thousand on youtube and for 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 half a year why are you filming at all 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.399
 videos if you show how it is like 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.979
 other 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 why was the channel originally gaming but 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.860
 smoothly flows into la and because 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 starts to bother 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.000
 and how very boring it becomes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.250
 I want to win something like that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 live and real like you want to laugh and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
