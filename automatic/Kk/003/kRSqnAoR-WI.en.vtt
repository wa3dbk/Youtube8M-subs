to do tracer in a certain space a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000 
to do tracer in a certain space a
certain<00:00:48.989> website<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.649> want<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:49.950> to

certain website that you want to go to
like<00:00:50.579> Google<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.059> typed<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> Google<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.050> tracer

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
like Google I typed in Google so tracer

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.520 
like Google I typed in Google so tracer
space<00:00:52.920> google.com<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> does

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
space google.com and then what it does

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.450 
space google.com and then what it does
is<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.969> gives<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> huge<00:00:57.840> list<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.920> these

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
is it gives you a huge list of all these

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
is it gives you a huge list of all these
peoples<00:00:59.640> ip's<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:01.370> google<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.710> would<00:01:04.860> just

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
peoples ip's on google so you would just

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.420 
peoples ip's on google so you would just
basically<00:01:06.200> wait<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.799> done<00:01:07.950> loading

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
basically wait for it to be done loading

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
basically wait for it to be done loading
and<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.030> also<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> pick<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and then also what you do is you pick a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.179 
and then also what you do is you pick a
certain<00:01:10.890> IP<00:01:11.630> from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> list<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.040> going

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
certain IP from the list and I'm going

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.160 
certain IP from the list and I'm going
to<00:01:14.220> choose<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:15.450> here

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
