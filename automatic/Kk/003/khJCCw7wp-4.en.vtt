00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
speed it a bit I think this is the final

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.910 
speed it a bit I think this is the final
four

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.290 

alright<00:05:21.920> anyways<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.490> pretty<00:05:22.940> much<00:05:23.060> it

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
for this video I think we could go into

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.700 
for this video I think we could go into
battle<00:05:26.000> actually<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:26.630> can<00:05:26.840> never<00:05:27.200> mind
