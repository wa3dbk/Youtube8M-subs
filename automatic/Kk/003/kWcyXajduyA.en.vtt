00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:14.009
 God looks like a damn terminator the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.920
 Uncle front the front 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.720
 of a car of the year 2057 after the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.640
 socialist part there is a concept but I 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 it does not matter the case was back in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.630
 this video because today I come to teach you 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 a trick watching if some kind of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 game failure so to speak that is 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.920
 very cool best purpose who knows the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.600
 btr case will teach us how to power 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.050
 drive a car fall with a gun in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.399
 hand 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.960
 so how are you listening? 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.460
 to be able to for example drive first 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.140
 pressure and we will be able to see in our 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.960
 hand the weapon that we go for example a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.030
 minibus in hand thing that teaches us 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.879
 why not so yes do not look at the coffee 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.579
 how are we going to do it well, well, if we give 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.379
 twice to the right you know that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 we point out simply to give it twice to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.010
 right joystick like I said then 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 we have to do so, look, we put on a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 weapon to see if this one we put a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 gun we stopped a car from someone and now 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.480
 what we have to do is press two 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 times the button of this one 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.990
 the uncle of the car is worth but the 8 more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.509
 I miss more what's done wrong I've done it wrong 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.299
 you really have to put on 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.500
 to the door 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.149
 in a car here quiet that what 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.509
 we do well 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.539
 ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay we come by 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.130
 here we point out we point and we can no longer 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.820
 talk about the door and now we give it to 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.920
 ay ay ay ay and now the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.630
 pointing animation and then there is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 we already have the gun the hand guy like 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.159
 this we have here the gun in your hand 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.869
 is this data behind me or is it very 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.039
 very clear how are you seeing and if 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.330
 We aim, as you can see, it is taken away 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.429
 which I did not know and about 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.539
 division to have the case removed 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.409
 as you have seen just doing that 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.259
 moment that the counter is so that 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.310
 you see look just do not know why not 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.039
 can be done with the mini pula true 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.479
 but well look, we do that, they sell us 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.399
 for example before this man we point 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.740
 we point out we point out we see the one of the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.539
 door and we ride there is and now 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.549
 when the animation of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.510
 point out to see what point you look at 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.400
 I have the same 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.979
 and then driving with the damn 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.160
 mineiro as you are seeing it is something 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 quite quite strange the truth and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.770
 nothing politically this what he did in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.760
 I've said this video and what are the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.240
 steps for a car with someone 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.830
 in that you put the weapon that you want 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.780
 put yourself in your hand once you do 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 that then then you press the fold the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.110
 I am right to point out you put 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.090
 next to the car door which 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.200
 has shot you ride and then with 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.210
 this goya when you are already assembled 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.500
 they will put evil in my hand I tend to 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.030
 look for a motorbike to do it with the motorbike 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.830
 because with the bike it is very cool what 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.750
 the mini boom is totally epic 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.190
 same very handsome for these days already 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.130
 you can from the third person looks 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.930
 how the soul looks there are the words you see 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 that there are some cars with which 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.980
 go through look now now now now 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 yes that is it seems that the weapon is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.300
 saying hello what happens I'm here then 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.980
 if you turn the left 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.510
 the joystick of the steering wheel or fixes that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.280
 hands move thus moving the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 weapons we can leave for example weapons 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.700
 up in plan as if it were a 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.110
 fireplace you know back or plan as if 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.390
 we had an orthopedic arm and the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.010
 it's really pretty cool this 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.810
 trick that I honestly loved 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.160
 so obviously you are looking for a motorcycle 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.330
 I find it out there and once I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.810
 find then cut the video and we 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.120
 we see 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.420
 to see how it looks like so now 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.420
 see you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.810
 Y
