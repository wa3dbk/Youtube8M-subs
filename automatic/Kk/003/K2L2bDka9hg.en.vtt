memory<00:05:51.460> also<00:05:51.850> is<00:05:52.000> very<00:05:52.210> low<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:52.690> mean<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.080> had<00:05:53.350> 64

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
memory also is very low I mean I had 64

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.700 
memory also is very low I mean I had 64
gigabytes<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:54.820> now<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:54.970> only<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.390> 7<00:05:55.990> okay
