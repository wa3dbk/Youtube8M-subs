the bills five-dollar bill used to make

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.730 
the bills five-dollar bill used to make
a<00:00:25.529> nice<00:00:25.769> ring<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:27.090> anymore<00:00:30.439> we<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a nice ring but not anymore we need to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.110 
a nice ring but not anymore we need to
basically<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.219> thirds<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.890> 30<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> half

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
basically do thirds the 30 to the half

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
basically do thirds the 30 to the half
of<00:00:36.239> half<00:00:37.399> on<00:00:38.399> half<00:00:39.230> three<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.829> mix<00:00:44.579> thirds<00:00:48.860> if

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of half on half three that mix thirds if

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
of half on half three that mix thirds if
only<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.640> theory<00:01:04.339> all<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
only in theory all right we have a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.890 
only in theory all right we have a
dollar<00:01:07.439> bill<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.770> thirds<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:11.790> fold<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> down

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
dollar bill in thirds we fold this down

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.899 
dollar bill in thirds we fold this down
here<00:01:15.530> chop<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.369> basically<00:01:21.110> legs

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
here chop off this here basically legs

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
here chop off this here basically legs
best<00:01:23.909> feature<00:01:26.150> one<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.330> those<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:27.780> are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.620 

if<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.920> want<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.490> be<00:01:39.580> pasty<00:01:40.000> square<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
if you want this to be pasty square it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.840 
if you want this to be pasty square it
is<00:01:43.780> best<00:01:44.050> guess<00:01:44.320> really<00:01:44.770> you're<00:01:45.460> not<00:01:45.490> probably

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
is best guess really you're not probably

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
is best guess really you're not probably
doing<00:01:46.600> anything<00:01:47.790> that's<00:01:48.790> intricate<00:01:49.600> but

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:06.510 

let's<00:01:53.979> guess<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.520> down<00:01:55.120> down<00:02:01.080> up<00:02:05.190> here<00:02:06.190> we're

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
let's guess that down down up here we're

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.580 
let's guess that down down up here we're
going<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.970> say<00:02:07.300> divide<00:02:07.570> these<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.869> half<00:02:08.080> just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
going to I say divide these in half just

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
going to I say divide these in half just
step<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.190> minute<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.640> edge<00:02:14.070> took<00:02:15.070> them<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
step in a minute the edge took them that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.900 
step in a minute the edge took them that
into<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.630> edge<00:02:22.980> did<00:02:23.980> my<00:02:24.160> job<00:02:24.400> interview<00:02:24.700> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
into the edge did my job interview I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.780 
into the edge did my job interview I
think<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.600> did<00:02:25.750> okay<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:27.489> can<00:02:27.640> hold

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
think I did okay but you can hold

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.300 
think I did okay but you can hold
background<00:02:28.270> checks<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:29.020> on<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.709> I'll

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
background checks I'm going on so I'll

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.070 
background checks I'm going on so I'll
probably<00:02:30.550> how<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.239> gonna<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.900> hear

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
probably how we gonna have to hear

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.360 
probably how we gonna have to hear
anything<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.900> did<00:02:38.140> okay<00:02:38.370> administration

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
anything but I did okay administration

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.350 
anything but I did okay administration
is<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.910> strong<00:02:40.450> suit<00:02:41.670> obviously<00:02:45.360> more

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
is not my strong suit obviously more

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.020 
is not my strong suit obviously more
into<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> usage<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> configuration

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
into the usage of not the configuration

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.039 
into the usage of not the configuration
of<00:02:49.200> software<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.580> moment<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> job

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
of software at the moment like a job

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.140 
of software at the moment like a job
that<00:02:56.260> lasts<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.920> six<00:02:57.190> months<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.940> that's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that lasts all in six months and that's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.230 
that lasts all in six months and that's
just<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.720> possible

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
just not possible

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.830 
just not possible
economy<00:03:01.610> for<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.670> most<00:03:02.850> part<00:03:05.270> not<00:03:06.270> always<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
economy for the most part not always the
