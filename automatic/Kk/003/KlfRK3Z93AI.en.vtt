00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
here because there's not a lot of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
here because there's not a lot of
opportunities<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.400> guys<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
opportunities for them the guys just

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
opportunities for them the guys just
look<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.240> immediately<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> say<00:01:10.290> no

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
look at them immediately and say no

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.920 
look at them immediately and say no
without<00:01:11.100> even<00:01:11.430> checking<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.150> their<00:01:12.330> skill<00:01:12.659> or

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
without even checking out their skill or

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.440 
without even checking out their skill or
talent<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> find<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.729> still<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.330> be

talent so I find that's just still to be

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.969 
talent so I find that's just still to be
the<00:01:15.600> number<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.020> reason<00:01:16.350> why<00:01:16.380> girls<00:01:16.830> aren't

there<00:04:14.780> right<00:04:14.960> now<00:04:14.990> doing<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:15.650> same<00:04:15.980> thing

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
there right now doing that same thing

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.910 
there right now doing that same thing
it's<00:04:17.120> really<00:04:17.390> hard<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.750> have<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.500> ability<00:04:18.709> to

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
it's really hard to have the ability to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.430 
it's really hard to have the ability to
do<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.670> to<00:04:20.390> accomplish<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
do so and to accomplish it

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.680 
do so and to accomplish it
it<00:04:21.890> would<00:04:22.040> seem<00:04:22.310> though<00:04:22.700> from<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.120> sponsorship

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
it would seem though from a sponsorship

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.840 
it would seem though from a sponsorship
standpoint<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.440> there<00:04:25.400> would<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.610> lot<00:04:25.760> of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
standpoint that there would be a lot of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.850
