00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 Review by Michael Band at the Nike 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 Fuel Band is a fitness 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.219
 it was with his one sporting 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 You can measure activities on the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.449
 wear right or left wrist 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.270
 or are three different sizes sm 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.390
 and l available 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 The band will be delivered in this box 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the also a short instruction to the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:36.390
 You can find set up in the box 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.950
 Also tied to that I still the same 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.950
 even more detail will be received 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.430
 an extension to the larger one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.430
 adapt band 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 a tool to open the band and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 to adjust the size 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 A USB cable is used to run the bundle 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 can connect to the computer over there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.359
 appropriate software more 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.860
 to be able to make settings 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:10.680
 and another small manual 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:17.090
 to setup the band that bands itself 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.090
 Looks like this is the ad 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.340
 the band should not fit exactly 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:32.210
 you can adjust the size simply by 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:35.079
 corresponding link members incorporating 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.079
 or remove 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.860
 according to nike, the band is said to be his 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.260
 can measure daily activities 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.630
 and then with friends for example 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.470
 can compare who is active in the day was 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.820
 which sport brings more points 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.430
 example one later the other 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.660
 basketball and can be so too 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
 different disciplines with each other 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.740
 to compare 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.190
 You can both have an app on the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.350
 iphone or android phone as well 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.750
 over the software at the pc 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.280
 the daily flood points you 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.170
 want to achieve 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 However, this is always only for the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.070
 following day and the following days possible 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.890
 and you can look at the day you arrive 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.860
 currently active is the points later 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.140
 lower or raise if you 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.090
 has reached its daily target lights 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.640
 also in the display on that one done that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.670
 has in the goal stands and a small 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.720
 animation is running this is nice and 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.020
 provides yet additional motivation 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.480
 You should be aiming for three days in a row 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.120
 you have reached a so-called series 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 started and gets synonymous appropriate 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.480
 feedback about the app in the iphone 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.489
 then there are more trophies if you can 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.380
 certain score reached on the day when 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.660
 your own goals more 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.459
 as doubled for example in one day 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.790
 and these if all with little ones 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:13.280
 animations both in the country and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.590
 Through the app further appreciated the band 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 costs 149 dollars in the states 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.770
 plus taxes and is natural 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.200
 not exactly a cheap one 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.520
 accessory 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.800
 if someone just enjoys it 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.420
 I can measure daily activities 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.670
 just recommend the bank 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.770
 I think they are quite good there 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.080
 it is also completely black where you are 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.660
 not so the technology looks through but 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.850
 only then with the button press the display 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.120
 appears and also in white with 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.010
 Transparency I have my band now 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.510
 a month and must say it does 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.970
 I enjoy wearing that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.830
 that's also fun to watch how 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.240
 many points one reaches daily whether one 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.290
 be yourself set target for the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.000
 day has reached 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.290
 or if you still or if you still 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.670
 any activities one day 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.640
 that should not be done 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.590
 suitable for really objectively objective 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.120
 to be able to say if someone sports a lot 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.459
 or whether he is really fit 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.930
 is by attaching to the wrist 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.269
 is clear that, for example, at 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.360
 Cycling points are hardly reached 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.050
 although it is from here we actively 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.720
 also have for example at 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.729
 playing tennis basketball or other 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.449
 Activity only four years are used 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.470
 can finally reach more points therefore 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.120
 I'll have it someday 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470
 said I do not look like now 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.539
 many others from my friends 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.460
 reach or how many points nike 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.470
 dictates what you can do an active day 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.139
 but should have just two weeks 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.820
 say my normal everyday a 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.289
 sporting activities measured in the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.410
 I really worn the band every day 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.810
 I 've looked then how many points 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.340
 have reached on average and have 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.990
 then try in the next two 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.240
 just a few weeks on average 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.349
 to achieve more points by doing so 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.060
 to be more active 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.550
 that also worked quite well and 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.580
 For that kind of motivation, I would 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.310
 but really recommend it but not 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.150
 as a truly objective measuring unit 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.080
 for example, the daily 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.130
 to measure calorie consumption 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.620
 I hope you had a lot of fun with that 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.510
 video and would be glad if you could 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.440
 video with your friends tells me 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.120
 maybe even a thumbs up 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.120
 there and then see you soon
