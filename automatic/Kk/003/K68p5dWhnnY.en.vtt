00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.350
 I would like to mesh with you today 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.630
 Markers are made of modeling clay 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:24.930
 and I would like that bit 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.269
 is a lot of fun and that's what you need 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 For that you are looking for the best on the internet 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.189
 according to templates from the different ones 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 angry birds and the pigs i have 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 Here is a cuddly animal I will 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 to use as a template 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.399
 then you need a wire on those 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 you can thread your figurines and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.110
 so that the figurine up for not playing 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 konrad slide down 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 just needed a pair of pliers 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 to plug the wire off depending on how 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.899
 Thick wire takes enough for this was 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.699
 actually already a scissors and 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.489
 a pair of pliers squeezed behind 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
 to squeeze beads 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 then we need those too 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.969
 modeling clay around the figurine too 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.309
 to form 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 I have to have a black pen 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 maybe to paint your eyes because 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think that will be nice otherwise 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.229
 difficult and those little eyebrows 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.380
 make 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 from the modeling clay and another 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.020
 knife 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 but you can also use other tools 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 the things just take the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.909
 Modeling a bit apart 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 can share and edit 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.530
 I'll take a look at the grades first 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.950
 angry bird I need yellow and red 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 White 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 the black eyebrows me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 afterwards on the angry birds out 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.630
 the oven comes and forms firm first 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.490
 we now have a red ball makes sure 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 that she is not too tall because in the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060
 size in which you make your bullet now 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.979
 do you have the stitches afterwards? 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.979
 mark on your strictly piece construction with 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.119
 for the belly and the eyes we need 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.119
 in the innkreis 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.099
 then the bird gets its own 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.099
 little yellow beak 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.960
 and on the head a few little red ones 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.960
 hair 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.980
 which had first forgotten to say 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.720
 that you need a needle with the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.730
 bad you now through your sphere 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.620
 otherwise he could afterwards 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.010
 wire not paint marker by 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.010
 push 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.599
 m 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.370
 I have to go back a bit now 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:01.250
 modeling because my bird is watching 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:04.849
 pretty much moved and not anymore 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.799
 and then she has her oven before and 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.489
 Put your birds on a baking sheet that 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.349
 is designed with paper if your birds 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.329
 or do not seem have become so good 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.220
 you can just as well as you want 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.669
 I 've done it here now 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.560
 balls process the modeling compound 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.729
 and just make mesh marks 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.919
 after the birds and pigs now 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.139
 we can cool them down with the 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.979
 paint black pen and then 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.979
 to fiddle 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.950
 then you take your advice and cut 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:02.340
 as much as you want for a mesh 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:04.470
 Marker needs her best is her 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.920
 threads a crimp bead first 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.920
 on 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.380
 take your pliers around the crimp bead 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.380
 flat to press 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.850
 so can your bird or in this case 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:39.120
 a pig is not up by rad 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.830
 Down slide down, yes, too 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.330
 once a squeeze pearl on it 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.020
 Do not let the pig down 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.020
 can slip away 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.450
 the protruding wire you can now 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.470
 cut it off when I'm poor 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.470
 strictly remains hanging pieces 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.570
 Now you have a pig stitch 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.570
 markers
