 so hello people today i show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.380
 it is best to build a herbarium 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.220
 and then finished as a nice folder 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.199
 First, I recommend you directly 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.949
 write down what trees here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.390
 want to collect and then in parks 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.510
 go or so parks or too 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.300
 natural forests where trees are labeled 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.239
 because if you just like that in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 reingeht forests have you ever not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.530
 clairvoyant leaves which plate 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.270
 Which tree is part of it? 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.789
 structured you wear yourselves on what you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.309
 want and then go to a park collects 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.430
 the leaves if you did that then 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.859
 then you go home and do every 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.539
 leaf best of large 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.170
 catalogs every sheet in one 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.640
 catalog page and then do this catalog 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 for about a week in a heated 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 make room and then the leaves 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.299
 actually dried and how he got them 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.290
 then further processed into the experience 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 in the folder 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.930
 I'll show you now so am back 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.250
 since now at a herbarium already in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.110
 a folder involved 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.850
 Here I explain to you now we that 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.220
 best of the leaves so does 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.070
 as I told you, you should 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.579
 Insert sheets in all catalogs 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 then let the leaves dry 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:57.180
 if there are now then dried 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.810
 you take out the things and sticks the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.170
 then recommend using spray adhesive 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.170
 I put you on a white sheet of paper 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.300
 that's part but if you do 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 handwritten the single 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.620
 want to make information if you 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.220
 Everything with computer want to recommend 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.190
 I'll ever give you the trees or 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.920
 then turn to find you have computer 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.220
 write here with ever 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.440
 information and on the other side 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.100
 he informs about the respective tree 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.420
 that then expressed everything and sticks there 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.160
 the leaves one should be the rough one then 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 for clarity and construction on 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.880
 very clear then a cover sheet 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.720
 table of contents with the individual 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:59.900
 plant chapters trees and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.130
 pages on which page the individual 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 leaves are found and then at the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.010
 each one scrolls the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.590
 number of pages specified 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.300
 the information and the information 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.250
 to the tree and so does the leaves 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.209
 her then always beautiful such slides here 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.390
 do it clean and then be nice with one 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.820

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.280
 clean yours is your herbarium 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.370
 actually already finished by the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.260
 spray adhesive also remains the structure 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.400
