00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.410
 friends of physics that story another 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.740
 time 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.809
 I like ephemerides and 50 years ago 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.339
 in the year 1964 that was proposed the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.339
 higgs mechanism 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 also the cern is celebrating 60 years 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.470
 to do science for peace now in the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 2014 more than two years ago that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.050
 already found the higgs boson on 8 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.870
 October 2013 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.570
 Peter Higgs and Francois English received 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 the Nobel prize for physics for having 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.680
 made the theoretical discovery of a 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.260
 mechanism that contributes to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.710
 understanding of the origin of the mass of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.200
 the subatomic particles 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.320
 I see that this topic of the mechanism of 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.750
 hicks and the the higgs boson follows 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.700
 without being well understood so that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 and here I am again because we are 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.630
 living in a fantastic time that does not 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.560
 we should miss it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.600
 what is the real importance of the finding 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.890
 of the higgs boson even though in 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.799
 some other videos I had already described 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.899
 aspects of the search for the boson of 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.850
 higgs I'm going to dedicate a few videos 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.310
 to try to explain why it is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.229
 important to you and me and to 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.940
 all human beings that the boson 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.460
 higgs has been found 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.650
 It's not enough to clarify that I'm not a physicist, 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.320
 he taught physics classes I do not intend 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.870
 monetize my YouTube channel no no 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.050
 I am interested in that even though 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.200
 we have good traffic I really just 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.280
 I want to better understand the nature of the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.860
 world where I live 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.870
 it's a simple matter of curiosity 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.750
 intellectual man that results 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.060
 and intellectual curiosity turns out to be 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 the essence of human progress and it is a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 evolutionary advantage that differentiates us 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.000
 us as a species 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 many years studying these issues for 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.730
 they have shown me the presence of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.349
 kind of gap that exists grandota 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 between physicists and people especially 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.459
 Spanish - speaking people 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.590
 I try to think like here is the 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.379
 board of the physicists with all their 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.420
 equations and their complex and 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.879
 down here is the people we are 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.549
 in bogotÃ¡ pereira buenos aires in 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.650
 Cordoba in all our cities of 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.720
 speaks Spanish completely 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.230
 incommunicado with these ideals of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.019
 science well I have the idea of 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.540
 that our YouTube channel is located 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.000
 in the middle and it has served as a bridge 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.040
 for many people for many people 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.829
 common that has wanted to approach the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.280
 physics without having the mathematical background 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.879
 necessary to converse with a physicist 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.879
 of particles 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.360
 it turns out that since we started climbing 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.819
 these videos then we have more than 4,000 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.920
 subscribers and about one million 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.560
 video reproductions that makes me 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.590
 think that probably this theory that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.870
 I have of the gap between science and 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.450
 people are real and that somehow 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.840
 we have helped to close that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.379
 gap a little bit and that's good too 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.970
 it is true that people do not usually 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.829
 let's say detect the great facts of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.379
 the story when they happen on it 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.060
 time they are living I can 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.489
 imagine up to the house where he lived 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.769
 beethoven between 1818 1824 the time of the 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.810
 ninth symphony and I can imagine 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.489
 that the one on the front or the one on the side 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.099
 I saw every day and maybe I would 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.799
 it seemed like a less silly neighbor and very 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.230
 tired with the piano and very repetitive not 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.349
 I knew I was living next to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.170
 beethoven or this is also the house of 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.520
 Einstein in Berne is also very possible 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.590
 that your neighbor from the other mind 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.380
 I was more than I reach 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.530
 in the corridors or they knew that I 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.550
 albert and they did not know the quality of the genius 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.440
 what they were dealing with and the amount 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.320
 of contributions that this man would make 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 for science in the world that's why I think 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.070
 that it is possible that the fact that 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.050
 we have living with the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.140
 higgs boson finding 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.300
 make us not see ourselves as the 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.800
 real importance to us as 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.349
 species as human beings 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.770
 the finding of the higgs boson lords 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.759
 it's a big big big guy with 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.550
 capitals in the history of science 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.190
 and here we will be celebrating again 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.180
 human curiosity and the existence of 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.659
 entities like being the bibliography 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.870
 what are we going to use after all or 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.930
 all but not much of the center of the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.330
 web page of the serna that I recommend 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.330
 a lot to consult and also 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.720
 to get into the subject 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.720
 let's wait for the video that follows
