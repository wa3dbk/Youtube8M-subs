00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
okay so the movie called a heck I don't

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay so the movie called a heck I don't
know<00:00:05.910> but<00:00:07.220> what<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.250> did<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.269> enable<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
know but what I did was to enable the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.589 
know but what I did was to enable the
console<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.670> Messick<00:00:11.670> three<00:00:12.000> Devils<00:00:12.450> were

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
console for Messick three Devils were

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.029 
console for Messick three Devils were
the<00:00:13.219> 1.2<00:00:14.219> version<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> game<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.039> recently

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the 1.2 version of the game and recently

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
the 1.2 version of the game and recently
there's<00:00:17.279> been<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.520> 1.3<00:00:18.180> patch<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.910> I'm<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
there's been a 1.3 patch and I'm not a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.750 
there's been a 1.3 patch and I'm not a
programmer<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.439> anything<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> can't<00:00:23.400> really

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
programmer or anything so I can't really

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.330 
programmer or anything so I can't really
figure<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> should<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> try<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
figure out how I should go and try and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.210 
figure out how I should go and try and
figure<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:26.990> there's<00:00:27.990> someone<00:00:28.710> posted

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
figure it out but there's someone posted

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.170 
figure it out but there's someone posted
on<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.429> youtube<00:00:30.470> video<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.969> thought<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> little

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
on my youtube video I thought a little

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
on my youtube video I thought a little
bit<00:00:33.450> earlier<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.050> figured<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> since

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
bit earlier but I figured that since

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.660 
bit earlier but I figured that since
Origen<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:36.800> origin<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> spire<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
Origen was a origin was a spire in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
Origen was a origin was a spire in
itself<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> wouldn't<00:00:39.450> work<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:39.960> he<00:00:40.829> had<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
itself it wouldn't work but he had the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.760 
itself it wouldn't work but he had the
idea<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.329> using<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.930> 1.2<00:00:43.620> exe<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.719> I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
idea of just using the 1.2 exe and I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.020 
idea of just using the 1.2 exe and I
just<00:00:46.770> thought<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.010> origin<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.760> shake

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just thought that origin would shake

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
just thought that origin would shake
what<00:00:48.239> buildi<00:00:48.629> were<00:00:48.719> using<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.350> wouldn't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
what buildi were using and it wouldn't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
what buildi were using and it wouldn't
work<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.239> figured<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> might<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.199> well

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
work but it's I figured I might as well

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
work but it's I figured I might as well
give<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.800> try<00:00:52.829> after<00:00:53.280> he<00:00:53.520> commented<00:00:54.059> because

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
give it a try after he commented because

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
give it a try after he commented because
I<00:00:54.449> mean<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.550> wasn't<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.699> doing<00:00:56.820> anything

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I mean I wasn't really doing anything

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.200 
I mean I wasn't really doing anything
else<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:59.600> yeah<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.969> ended<00:01:03.180> up

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
else but yeah so it actually ended up

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.710 
else but yeah so it actually ended up
working<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.549> still<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
working so if you don't still have the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.230 
working so if you don't still have the
