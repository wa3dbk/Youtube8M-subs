a few contractors of which Wilmot Dixon

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
is one and we like to to work on that

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.900 
is one and we like to to work on that
long-term<00:00:17.890> relationship<00:00:18.550> where<00:00:18.670> we<00:00:18.760> can

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
long-term relationship where we can

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.880 
long-term relationship where we can
build<00:00:19.060> up<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:19.720> learn<00:00:19.930> from<00:00:20.110> one<00:00:20.350> project<00:00:20.620> to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
build up and learn from one project to

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.190 
build up and learn from one project to
the<00:00:21.070> other<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.210> we<00:00:22.300> can<00:00:22.450> get<00:00:22.570> project<00:00:22.990> better

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
the other so we can get project better

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.990 
the other so we can get project better
each<00:00:23.470> time<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:24.400> that's<00:00:24.550> why<00:00:24.640> I<00:00:24.670> think<00:00:24.730> we're

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
each time and that's why I think we're

00:00:25.000 --> 00:04:04.110 
each time and that's why I think we're
achieving<00:00:25.090> with<00:00:25.539> robotics

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.030
