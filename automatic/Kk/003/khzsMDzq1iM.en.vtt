sure<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:06.150> yeah<00:00:06.480> as<00:00:06.690> mentioned<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> first

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
sure so yeah as mentioned this the first

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.500 
sure so yeah as mentioned this the first
one<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.069> our<00:00:08.280> tee<00:00:08.429> device<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.940> has<00:00:09.059> has<00:00:09.300> been

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
one is our tee device that has has been

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.120 
one is our tee device that has has been
shown<00:00:09.719> publicly<00:00:09.900> we're<00:00:10.590> pretty<00:00:10.740> proud<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.950> it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
shown publicly we're pretty proud of it

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.129 
shown publicly we're pretty proud of it
so<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.820> running<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.150> Tegra<00:00:12.480> 3<00:00:12.509> quad-core

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so this is running a Tegra 3 quad-core

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.890 
so this is running a Tegra 3 quad-core
processor<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.280> I'll<00:00:14.730> show<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> some<00:00:15.210> just

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
processor in it I'll show you some just

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
processor in it I'll show you some just
how<00:00:15.990> fast<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.949> second<00:00:17.279> year<00:00:17.430> but

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
how fast that is in a second year but

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790 
how fast that is in a second year but
this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.140> Tegra<00:00:19.410> 3<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this is actually the Tegra 3 is going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
this is actually the Tegra 3 is going to
be<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> only<00:00:20.189> quad<00:00:20.670> core<00:00:20.939> processor<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
be the only quad core processor that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
be the only quad core processor that
that<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.740> available<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.609> these<00:00:23.970> costs

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that is available on these these costs

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.689 
that is available on these these costs
of<00:00:24.330> devices<00:00:24.750> at<00:00:25.170> launch<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.220> performance

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
of devices at launch so the performance

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.740 
of devices at launch so the performance
on<00:00:26.789> these<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
on these are going to it's going to be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.109 
on these are going to it's going to be
really<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:29.340> quick<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.849> food

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
really really really quick really food

responsive fluid and fast now one of the
really<00:01:08.130> cool<00:01:08.220> things<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.820> Windows<00:01:09.479> RT<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
really cool things about Windows RT is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
really cool things about Windows RT is
that<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> bring<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that it's it's really going to bring a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
that it's it's really going to bring a
lot<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.750> capabilities<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.799> these

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
lot more capabilities to these these

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.100 
lot more capabilities to these these
touch<00:01:14.430> devices<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> great<00:01:15.630> example<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
touch devices and a great example of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.370 
touch devices and a great example of
that<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.860> multitasking<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.509> microsoft

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that is is multitasking so one microsoft

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
that is is multitasking so one microsoft
introduces<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> idea<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.580> edge<00:01:20.880> detect<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
introduces this idea of edge detect so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
introduces this idea of edge detect so
you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> swipe<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> side<00:01:23.070> of
