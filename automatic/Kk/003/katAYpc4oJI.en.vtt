00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.629 
again okay now we'll let that dry wait
wait<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.560> was<00:03:20.739> doing<00:03:20.949> this<00:03:21.069> earlier<00:03:21.430> today

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
wait what I was doing this earlier today

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.379 
wait what I was doing this earlier today
I<00:03:22.000> didn't<00:03:22.629> let<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.750> dry<00:03:23.199> and<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.639> when<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.180> was

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
I didn't let it dry and so when I was

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.930 
I didn't let it dry and so when I was
putting<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.750> other<00:03:25.930> colors<00:03:26.260> on<00:03:26.699> came<00:03:27.699> out<00:03:27.819> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
putting the other colors on came out to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.509 
putting the other colors on came out to
be<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.329> bad<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.620> colors<00:03:29.919> were<00:03:30.040> mixing
