00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.210
 I'll show you a pair made with all-terrain vehicle. 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.810
 to date, work with 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.540
 hood with chuck began to do 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 small bumper first place for 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:28.750
 convenience of repair secondarily for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.730
 protect the steering gears 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.930
 trees that will still be 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:43.150
 attend so here we have what type 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:47.350
 open frame aluminum hood 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.440
 lined with aluminum here this is the engine compartment 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 space basically remains work 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.760
 by posting 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.560
 wiring almost completely yet 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.470
 absent except for two or three 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.220
 wires sufficient for work 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.220
 engine 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.660
 in the cabin, in general, too, already 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 transmission tunnel finished 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.610
 it remains only to bring these 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.140
 holes 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.320
 switch handle with dotki started here 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.730
 working with so let's say with the instrument panel 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.730
 it will be a shelf open 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:44.950
 seat seen from behind the luggage compartment in 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 in general, too, almost finished here in this 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.470
 place over the wings for the aluminum 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.320
 the strips will be curved 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.120
 tool boxes that will 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 close on top with soft lids on 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.160
 which will be able to sit at least two more 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:12.370
 man is our aluminum tank 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.629
 capacity it turned out 70 species 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:23.680
 cork on it 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:28.140
 from boating level indicators i 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 counted so much easier and quite 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:39.879
 workable then stuff for 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:43.269
 connect the fuel line that is 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.310
 the sensor when he will be us in the tank 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.489
 apparently will remain an example 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.640
 15 liters so let's say the default relief 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.099
 here is the total tank capacity of 70 liters like me 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.739
 already said 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.200
 I think to heighten the engine of this quite 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.560
 missing all this too gear 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.150
 the tunnel is already curved all prepared 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.829
 childhood is not fixed here just now 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 these here 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:27.060
 control handles razdatka these will 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 will output connected by and large 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.680
 the hardest thing left to do too 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.879
 instrument panel while on it 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.590
 it is calculated that there will be voltmeters 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.440
 temperature gauge 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 Well, in general, these are the main devices 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.359
 which should be ie tachometer like 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.959
 such do not need fuel pressure in 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.650
 In general, there is also enough control 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.489
 light bulbs 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.690
 that is, this moment does not come from 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.989
 approximately in this condition here and there 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.989
 still 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.629
 battery that is also used 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.629
 to the maximum 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.370
 drawing battery in general then you 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:22.640
 shifted closer to the back of the all-terrain vehicle 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:29.190
 that is, to date, 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:34.080
 rear springs are from which front 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.380
 abdominal as seen almost completely 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.740
 they 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:47.250
 put forward by the rain and on the front 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.880
 stand for her 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.150
 little window i am spring they here are an example 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.450
 Here in the position in which I 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.510
 conceived what god sounds like 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.510
 So
