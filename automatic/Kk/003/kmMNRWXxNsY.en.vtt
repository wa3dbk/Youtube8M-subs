so but I'm also feeling it it would be
hard<00:02:53.680> for<00:02:53.799> me<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.190> accept<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.850> really

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060

would be because I think I kind of

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.880 
would be because I think I kind of
really<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.970> would<00:02:58.239> be<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:59.709> taking

a<00:04:40.789> picture<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.360> did<00:04:41.539> pick<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.870> word<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.320> started<00:04:42.740> a

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
a picture I did pick a word I started a

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.999 
a picture I did pick a word I started a
picture<00:04:43.270> it's<00:04:44.270> really<00:04:45.229> fun<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.740> going

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
picture it's really fun it's going

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.820 
picture it's really fun it's going
really<00:04:46.130> well<00:04:46.419> really<00:04:47.419> loving<00:04:47.750> drawing<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.500> so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
really well really loving drawing it so

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.710 
really well really loving drawing it so
I<00:04:49.130> absolutely<00:04:49.820> think<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.389> that<00:04:50.509> would<00:04:50.660> be

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
I absolutely think that that would be

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.659 
I absolutely think that that would be
something<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.349> will<00:04:51.650> work<00:04:51.710> out<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.550> I'm

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
something that will work out and I'm

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.100 
something that will work out and I'm
hoping<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.270> can<00:04:53.389> make<00:04:53.539> that<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.750> weekly

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
hoping that we can make that a weekly

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.339 
hoping that we can make that a weekly
thing<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.580> all<00:04:55.759> depends<00:04:56.270> it<00:04:56.570> takes<00:04:56.780> can

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
thing but it all depends it takes can

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.080 
thing but it all depends it takes can
take<00:04:57.530> kind<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.800> long<00:04:57.979> to<00:04:58.160> draw<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.610> drawing

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
take kind of long to draw a drawing

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.070 
take kind of long to draw a drawing
sometimes<00:04:59.690> or<00:05:00.190> actually<00:05:01.190> again<00:05:01.849> what<00:05:02.630> really

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
sometimes or actually again what really

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.839 
sometimes or actually again what really
takes<00:05:03.289> time<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.830> not<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.130> actual<00:05:04.400> drawing

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
takes time is not the actual drawing

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.370 
takes time is not the actual drawing
it's<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.509> the<00:05:06.080> rendering<00:05:06.680> because<00:05:07.509> my<00:05:08.509> computer

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
it's a the rendering because my computer

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.890 
it's a the rendering because my computer
is<00:05:09.620> pretty<00:05:09.949> bad<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.970> actually<00:05:14.210> does<00:05:14.599> take

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
is pretty bad it actually does take

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.980 
is pretty bad it actually does take
longer<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.409> render<00:05:15.560> than<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.949> draw<00:05:16.539> it<00:05:17.539> feels<00:05:17.810> a

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
longer to render than to draw it feels a

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.399 
longer to render than to draw it feels a
bit<00:05:18.050> silly<00:05:18.409> well<00:05:19.370> yeah<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.720> think<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.260> was

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
bit silly well yeah I I think that was

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.830 
bit silly well yeah I I think that was
it<00:05:21.590> except<00:05:22.099> of<00:05:22.400> course<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:23.000> most<00:05:23.330> important

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840
