00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.329
Hi.

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm Katrina Zish on behalf of Crest 3-D White.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.580
Today we’re going to talk about how to remove
stains from our teeth.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.519
To do that, I'm joined by cosmetic dentist
Dr. Brian Cantor.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.519
Nice to see you.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.519
Nice to see you.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.020
Okay, so now, why do our teeth discolor?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.270
Stains are so frustrating.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.460
Well, teeth are unfortunately porous.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.619
And you use them often, multiple meals a day
for as many years as you’ve been alive.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.410
So the stains are going to accumulate over
time.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.730
And if you have bad oral hygiene, that stain
will accumulate at a faster rate.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
Now what causes these stains in the first
place?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.800
Things we love to do cause stains, coffee,
tea, red wine, chocolate, and smoking.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.010
All of those products will actually increase
the staining on your teeth.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.010
Okay.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
Well I got to say, coffee, red wine, chocolate,
those aren't going anywhere.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.680
So how do we actually counteract those and
remove the stains from our teeth?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.050
Well one thing we can try is whitening.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.940
And everyone wants to know, everyone wants
a bleach, everyone wants to whiten their teeth.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.190
But what's the difference between whitening
and bleaching?

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.540
Well whitening is where you make the teeth
appear whiter than they are by removing the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.670
surface stains.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.430
So the first thing we would do is try over
the counter whitening products, or go to your

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.280
dentist to have your teeth cleaned, to remove
the stain and see if that’s stain or actually

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.030
the color of your teeth.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.680
If you want your teeth whiter than that, then
you have to bleach your teeth.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.360
And bleaching actually puts a hydrogen peroxide
material, which is a bleaching agent.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.840
And the oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide
will oxidize these long chain stains and breaks

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.700
these chains intrinsically.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.260
And that actually bleaches the tooth, making
the teeth lighter than they actually were.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.140
Now do the at-home solutions work for this?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.110
Well they do work.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.530
And how well a bleaching product works is
really depending on two factors.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.540
One is, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.790
The more concentration of hydrogen peroxide,
the better the product will work.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.760
And, however long and well the bleaching product
remains isolated on your teeth.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.690
So a lot of these over the counter products
are whitening products, just whitening toothpaste.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.540
These will whiten the teeth by removing a
surface stain to make the teeth appear whiter.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.640
But there are over the counter bleaching products
as well, such as Crest White Strips.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.920
What these do is they actually will remain
isolated on your teeth and allow the bleaching

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
process to work.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.259
So they do work.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.480
And the beauty of these over the counter products,
it’s a lot cheaper.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
And they are effective.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
That’s great.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
So a lot more accessible for a lot more people
on a budget.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.500
A lot more accessible.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.130
The results can vary.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.950
It works differently for everyone.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.470
But over the counter products do work.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.170
Now will this affect dental work, say veneers
or crowns?

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.170
Yes.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.440
When you have dental work, either crowns,
veneers, bridges, that porcelain will not

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.480
change color.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.709
You can't-- You can't change the color of
the porcelain.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.980
So if you're going to bleach your teeth, and
your teeth are intertwined with this dental

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.590
work, your teeth are going to get lighter,
and the porcelain will not.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.160
So it kind of defeats the purpose of bleaching.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880
So not everyone is a candidate for bleaching.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.030
So you should really see your dentist before
you start bleaching your teeth.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.030
Okay.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.069
Now once I finally remove these stains, how
do I keep them removed?

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.459
Maintenance.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.349
You have to maintain your smile.

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.040
If you bleach your teeth, you have to maintain
a healthy smile.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.099
You have to have good oral hygiene and try
over the counter products, the whitening toothpaste,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.250
the whitening rinse.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.819
These will help remove the surface stain to
maintain your white smile.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:06.819
Okay, great.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.819
All great information.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.819
Thank you so much, Dr. Cantor.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.819
Thank you.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:10.819
Okay.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.930
Our teeth thank Dr. Cantor here. and I say,
stains beware and be gone.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.040
Let’s recap.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.319
Stains are caused by dark foods and drinks
that we love.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.570
So brush soon after if you simply can't resist.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
And to remove the build-up of stains, you
can have a professional or an at-home whitening

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.319
done.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.930
After the treatment, help keep your whiter
smile by a regular routine that uses the whitening

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.959
toothpaste, floss and mouthwashes available.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.380
And lastly, if you smoke, then stop.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.190
Whiter teeth are only one of the many reasons
to quit.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.430
See your dentist or healthcare professional
about getting help.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.150
On behalf of Crest, I'm Katrina Zish.
