00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.630 
root growth here comfy can be propagated
in<00:00:55.829> two<00:00:56.160> main<00:00:56.399> ways<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.859> either<00:00:58.859> root

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
in two main ways which is either root

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.229 
in two main ways which is either root
cuttings<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.600> by<00:01:00.930> division<00:01:01.609> division<00:01:02.609> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cuttings or by division division it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.880 
cuttings or by division division it's
simply<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.719> planting<00:01:04.909> 23<00:01:06.110> simply<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.650> when

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
simply just planting 23 simply like when

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
simply just planting 23 simply like when
you<00:01:08.010> chop<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.720> stick

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you chop them up and then just stick

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.310 
you chop them up and then just stick
this<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> ground<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.220> it'll<00:01:11.490> grow<00:01:11.670> again

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
this in the ground and it'll grow again

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.920 
this in the ground and it'll grow again
very<00:01:13.320> easy<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> we're<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.689> looking

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
very easy so we're going to be looking

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
very easy so we're going to be looking
mainly<00:01:16.320> root<00:01:17.040> cuttings<00:01:17.610> today<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.400> best<00:01:20.400> time

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
mainly root cuttings today and best time

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
mainly root cuttings today and best time
to<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.750> earlier<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> spring

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to do it as a bit earlier in the spring

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.420 
to do it as a bit earlier in the spring
and<00:01:27.590> basically

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and basically

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.430 
and basically
yep<00:01:31.100> get<00:01:32.100> rid<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> most<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> soil<00:01:33.440> like

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
yep get rid of most of the soil like

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.790 
yep get rid of most of the soil like
that<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.480> in<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.900> find<00:01:37.260> some<00:01:37.530> good<00:01:38.420> roots

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
that now go in and find some good roots

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.950 
that now go in and find some good roots
to<00:01:40.800> cut<00:01:41.010> up<00:01:42.680> like<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> basically<00:01:48.660> if<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
to cut up like that so basically if you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.900 
to cut up like that so basically if you
like<00:01:49.110> plant<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.580> will<00:01:50.730> grow

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
like plant that to there that will grow

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:59.560 
like plant that to there that will grow
into<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> plant<00:01:51.770> runs<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:56.750> cut<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.870> off<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
into a plant runs here cut this off and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
into a plant runs here cut this off and
that's<00:02:00.570> off<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.650> go<00:02:01.800> into<00:02:01.950> another

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that's off that will go into another

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
that's off that will go into another
plant<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.330> easy<00:02:04.790> by<00:02:05.790> basically<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
plant and it's so easy by basically this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.810 
plant and it's so easy by basically this
is<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> sweet<00:02:07.200> division<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.040> not<00:02:08.280> boot<00:02:08.459> cutting

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
is a sweet division so not boot cutting

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.360 
is a sweet division so not boot cutting
so<00:02:09.390> easily<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.140> putting<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.160> just

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so easily just putting this in I'm just

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.910 
so easily just putting this in I'm just
gonna<00:02:11.820> grow<00:02:12.120> into<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.080> plant<00:02:14.270> comfrey<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.920> quite

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
gonna grow into a plant comfrey is quite

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.110 
gonna grow into a plant comfrey is quite
good<00:02:17.280> at<00:02:17.640> transplanting<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:19.290> well<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.880> just

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
good at transplanting as well I'm just

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.430 
good at transplanting as well I'm just
going<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:22.670> finding<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.360> bits<00:02:24.570> mobs<00:02:24.870> now

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
going on finding all the bits mobs now

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.940 
going on finding all the bits mobs now
with<00:02:25.650> root<00:02:26.010> cuttings<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.530> bit<00:02:28.709> different

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
with root cuttings it's a bit different

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.760 
with root cuttings it's a bit different
root<00:02:29.850> cuttings<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.959> don't<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.380> have<00:02:31.410> them

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
root cuttings you don't we have them

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.560 
root cuttings you don't we have them
here<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.610> soil<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.000> quite<00:02:33.209> shallow

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
here because the soil is quite shallow

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.240 
here because the soil is quite shallow
yes<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> bit<00:02:38.130> of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
yes we do like this you get a bit of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.600 
yes we do like this you get a bit of
root<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.830> maybe<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> bit<00:02:41.220> smaller

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
root like that and maybe a bit smaller

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.720 
root like that and maybe a bit smaller
in<00:02:41.790> size<00:02:42.120> oh<00:02:42.470> no<00:02:43.470> about<00:02:43.709> an<00:02:44.190> inch<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.700> two

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
in size oh no about an inch to two

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.210 
in size oh no about an inch to two
inches<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> stick<00:02:46.890> them<00:02:47.150> either

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
inches and then you stick them either

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.930

straight<00:02:50.220> down<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:51.000> trays<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:53.640> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
straight down in trays up like this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.320 
straight down in trays up like this
honey<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:56.430> root<00:02:56.760> joiners<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.950> a

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
honey in root joiners so this is a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.890 
honey in root joiners so this is a
creeping<00:03:00.330> type<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.900> Russian<00:03:01.290> comfrey<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
creeping type of Russian comfrey and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.250 
creeping type of Russian comfrey and
this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.080> quite<00:03:04.410> quite<00:03:04.739> low<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.370> shallow<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
this is quite quite low in shallow the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.140 
this is quite quite low in shallow the
best<00:03:07.590> root<00:03:08.519> cuttings<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.870> will<00:03:10.769> be

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
best root cuttings like these will be

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.640 
best root cuttings like these will be
taken<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:14.120> large<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.840> general<00:03:16.260> comfrey

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
taken from large just a general comfrey

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.030 
taken from large just a general comfrey
and<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.700> might<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.299> some<00:03:18.600> other<00:03:18.630> time<00:03:19.040> so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and I might do that some other time so

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.330 
and I might do that some other time so
just<00:03:20.519> go<00:03:20.820> along<00:03:21.060> looking<00:03:21.830> for<00:03:22.830> smaller<00:03:23.100> bits

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
just go along looking for smaller bits

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.240 
just go along looking for smaller bits
of<00:03:23.549> roots<00:03:24.480> maybe<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.140> bit<00:03:25.260> small<00:03:25.560> but

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
of roots maybe that's a bit small but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.340 
of roots maybe that's a bit small but
just<00:03:26.310> about<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.850> size<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.480> stick<00:03:28.019> them<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
just about that size and stick them in a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.930 
just about that size and stick them in a
pot<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.950> they<00:03:29.850> should<00:03:30.209> grow<00:03:30.709> as<00:03:31.709> come<00:03:32.220> going

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
pot and they should grow as come going

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:45.060 
pot and they should grow as come going
in<00:03:33.440> looking<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.620> them

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.790 

this<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.280> an<00:03:46.550> example<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.390> what<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.650> will<00:03:48.740> look

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
this is an example of what it will look

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.290 
this is an example of what it will look
like<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.890> transplant<00:03:51.890> tonight

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
like when you transplant tonight

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.100 
like when you transplant tonight
suckers<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:55.280> where<00:03:56.060> after<00:03:56.240> you've<00:03:56.480> divided

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
suckers the where after you've divided

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.220 
suckers the where after you've divided
them<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:58.370> instantly<00:03:58.700> have<00:03:59.390> not<00:03:59.780> lose<00:03:59.990> more

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
them so you instantly have not lose more

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.300 
them so you instantly have not lose more
comfy<00:04:00.620> plants<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:02.050> here<00:04:03.050> we<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.440> wee<00:04:03.980> bit

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
comfy plants and here we have a wee bit

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.730
