00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
in 5 inch truck adapters this is the one

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.580 
in 5 inch truck adapters this is the one
and<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> half<00:00:21.539> inch<00:00:21.779> truck<00:00:22.019> adapter<00:00:22.439> I'm

and a half inch truck adapter I'm

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.630 
and a half inch truck adapter I'm
holding<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:22.980> there's<00:00:23.220> four<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.460> these

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
holding here there's four of these

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
holding here there's four of these
there's<00:00:23.970> also<00:00:24.150> four<00:00:24.630> five<00:00:25.080> inch<00:00:25.289> truck

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500

to<00:00:28.140> lift<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.470> Dodge<00:00:28.710> Ram<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.730> lift<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to lift this Dodge Ram this lift is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
to lift this Dodge Ram this lift is
asymmetric<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.560> front<00:00:31.890> arm<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
asymmetric because the front arm that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.550 
asymmetric because the front arm that
you<00:00:32.400> see<00:00:32.580> here<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.780> curved<00:00:34.140> whereas

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
you see here is actually curved whereas

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.620 
you see here is actually curved whereas
the<00:00:34.680> back<00:00:34.860> arm<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.280> straight<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.970> those<00:00:36.420> two

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the back arm is straight so those two

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
the back arm is straight so those two
arms<00:00:36.930> will<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.320> fold<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> point<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
arms will actually fold and point in the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
arms will actually fold and point in the
same<00:00:38.370> direction<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> or

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
same direction if you want them to or

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
same direction if you want them to or
you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.489> use

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you can use them to use that you can use

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.790 
you can use them to use that you can use
them<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> achieve<00:00:42.059> off-center<00:00:42.719> loading<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

too far it pulls up on that switch and
pulls<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.860> power<00:01:11.490> away<00:01:11.909> from<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> motor<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.810> now

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pulls a power away from the motor so now

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.690 
pulls a power away from the motor so now
we're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> demonstrate<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.159> just

Cummins it's full wheel drive crew cab

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
Cummins it's full wheel drive crew cab
and<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.380> long<00:01:22.560> bed<00:01:22.829> so<00:01:23.130> between<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and a long bed so between it and the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.499 
brush guard on the front of it Lou
estimate<00:01:26.640> we've<00:01:26.820> probably<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.329> an

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
estimate we've probably got about an

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
estimate we've probably got about an
eighty<00:01:27.689> five<00:01:27.900> hundred<00:01:28.259> pound<00:01:28.439> truck<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.920> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
eighty five hundred pound truck here so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:45.930 
eighty five hundred pound truck here so
let's<00:01:29.369> lift<00:01:29.579> it

now<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.270> push<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.170> release<00:02:26.620> lever

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
now I'm going to push the release lever

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
now I'm going to push the release lever
here<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.970> lower<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.420> vehicle<00:02:28.569> down<00:02:29.500> one<00:02:29.770> of
