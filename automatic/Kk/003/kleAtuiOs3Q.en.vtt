00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 Light or dark? 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.840
 Hard to say 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.300
 Everything in life has its price 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.920
 Invent what to do 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 Without at least one choice 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.520
 - FOLLOW YOUR WAY - 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.240
 Respect only you 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.400
 Do not 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.440
 - RANCOR AND THE HATE - 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.320
 Conquer you 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.560
 For those who did not believe 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.120
 That I could win here 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.880
 I left you my words 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.680
 Because the rest will forget 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.320
 - UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS - 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 And bet for you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 Restore this game 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.880
 And try to beat me 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 - UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS - 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 And try to realize 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.120
 Looking at each other 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 I found out who will lose 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.120
 Light or dark? 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.680
 I know you will understand 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.440
 I want you to pay attention. 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.160
 In what I now say: 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.240
 Are you lucky or unlucky? 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.040
 Now try to remember: 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.080
 What you got here 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.240
 It's almost everything you dreamed about. 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.120
 I know you lost your reason. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 But there is still a solution 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480
 And this is the time to bet 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.240
 That in this game, now I know 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.960
 I know who will win 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 - UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS - 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160
 And bet for you 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.280
 Restore this game 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.960
 And try to beat me 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.480
 - UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS - 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.360
 And try to realize 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.480
 Looking at each other 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.560
 I found out who will lose
