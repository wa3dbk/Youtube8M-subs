much<00:02:11.650> or<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> jello<00:02:12.100> won't<00:02:12.400> set<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.390> we're

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
much or the jello won't set so we're

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
much or the jello won't set so we're
just<00:02:13.660> doing<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.990> quarter<00:02:14.470> cup<00:02:14.710> although<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
just doing a quarter cup although you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.760

and then we'll come back and do the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
and then we'll come back and do the
second<00:02:32.260> layer<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> couple<00:02:33.819> hours<00:02:34.000> later

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
second layer so a couple hours later

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.370 
second layer so a couple hours later
this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.540> what<00:02:34.600> we're<00:02:34.780> looking<00:02:34.959> at<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:35.200> nice

be a big help if you can get a large

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.100 
be a big help if you can get a large
spoon<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.319> kind<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.650> use<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
spoon like this and kind of use it to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.240 
spoon like this and kind of use it to
pour<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> jello<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:00.830> gently<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
pour the jello on really gently the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.309 
pour the jello on really gently the
spoon<00:03:01.489> kind<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.819> helps<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.239> break<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.750> fall<00:03:02.959> so

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
spoon kind of helps to break the fall so

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.220 
spoon kind of helps to break the fall so
just<00:03:03.500> hold<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.769> spoon<00:03:03.950> upside<00:03:04.280> down<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.230> pour

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230

just hold the spoon upside down and pour
it<00:03:06.380> over<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.769> back<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.220> spoon<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:08.360> kind<00:03:08.540> of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
it over the back of the spoon it kind of

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it over the back of the spoon it kind of
disperses<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.890> little<00:03:10.099> bit<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:10.610> don't

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
disperses it a little bit so you don't

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.449 
disperses it a little bit so you don't
end<00:03:10.970> up<00:03:11.150> melting<00:03:11.930> into<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.440> cold<00:03:12.890> jello<00:03:13.280> at

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
end up melting into the cold jello at

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.490 
end up melting into the cold jello at
all<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.780> makes<00:03:14.959> sense<00:03:15.760> okay<00:03:16.959> awesome<00:03:17.959> now

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
