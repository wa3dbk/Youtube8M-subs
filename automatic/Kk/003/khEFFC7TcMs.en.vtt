00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
know we was running at a constant speed

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.319 
know we was running at a constant speed
rather<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> doing

whatever we would push nearly 200 miles
to<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> tank<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.920> good<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.159> today

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
