win<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.899> talking<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.549> question

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
win we're talking about this question

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
win we're talking about this question
like<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> question<00:02:03.450> no<00:02:04.079> am<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.560> my

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
like out of the question no am I my

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119 
like out of the question no am I my
contention<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.479> many<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:07.129> 10,000

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
contention is there's as many as 10,000

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.180 
contention is there's as many as 10,000
12,000<00:02:09.000> pieces<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.840> junk<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:10.590> floating

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
12,000 pieces of junk up there floating

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.040 
12,000 pieces of junk up there floating
around<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> see

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
around you're going to see

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.710 
around you're going to see
of<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.380> that's<00:02:13.310> right<00:02:13.460> Mike<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.940> probably<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
of it that's right Mike and probably the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.940 
of it that's right Mike and probably the
biggest<00:02:14.870> thing<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.410> worry<00:02:15.530> about<00:02:15.710> is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
biggest thing you have to worry about is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.680 
biggest thing you have to worry about is
it<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> same<00:02:16.460> orbit<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.850> with<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.330> or<00:02:17.510> some

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
it in the same orbit is with you or some

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.060 
it in the same orbit is with you or some
other<00:02:17.810> orbit<00:02:18.200> if<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> same<00:02:18.770> orbit

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
other orbit if it's in the same orbit

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.200 
other orbit if it's in the same orbit
it's<00:02:19.190> not<00:02:19.310> as<00:02:19.430> dangerous<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:19.970> it's<00:02:20.120> not

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
it's not as dangerous because it's not

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.420 
it's not as dangerous because it's not
going<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.540> fast<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.500> another<00:02:21.770> orbit<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
going as fast it's another orbit and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.220 
going as fast it's another orbit and
hits<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.270> say<00:02:23.450> twice<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.870> speed<00:02:24.080> you're

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
hits you and say twice the speed you're

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.660 
hits you and say twice the speed you're
going<00:02:24.290> at<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> thirty-five<00:02:25.280> thousand

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
going at so you thirty-five thousand

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.190 
going at so you thirty-five thousand
miles<00:02:25.820> an<00:02:25.970> hour<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.600> cause<00:02:26.780> serious<00:02:27.050> damage

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
miles an hour can cause serious damage

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.620 
miles an hour can cause serious damage
the<00:02:27.590> shuttle<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.610> what<00:02:29.420> could<00:02:29.540> these

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
the shuttle so what what could these

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.120 
the shuttle so what what could these
things<00:02:29.870> possibly<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.470> mean<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.740> lot<00:02:30.860> of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
things possibly be I mean a lot of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.430 
things possibly be I mean a lot of
people<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.490> writing<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.850> jenks<00:02:32.440> satellites

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
people are writing in jenks satellites

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.290 
people are writing in jenks satellites
is<00:02:33.680> often<00:02:34.040> they<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.250> satellite<00:02:34.730> pieces<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
is often they be satellite pieces of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 
is often they be satellite pieces of
satellites<00:02:35.750> well<00:02:36.200> they're<00:02:36.380> unlikely<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.830> be

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
satellites well they're unlikely to be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.590 
satellites well they're unlikely to be
off<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> satellite<00:02:37.520> because<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.270> fact<00:02:38.450> that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
off a satellite because the fact that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.330 
off a satellite because the fact that
the<00:02:38.870> they're<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> same<00:02:39.770> orbit<00:02:40.130> as<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the they're in the same orbit as the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.590 
the they're in the same orbit as the
shuttle<00:02:40.640> they're<00:02:40.790> floating<00:02:41.000> along<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
shuttle they're floating along with the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.540 
shuttle they're floating along with the
orbital<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.350> more<00:02:42.680> likely<00:02:43.100> it's<00:02:43.250> something

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
orbital so more likely it's something

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.920 
orbital so more likely it's something
that<00:02:43.670> was<00:02:43.790> maybe<00:02:43.940> dropped<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.570> payload

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
that was maybe dropped in the payload

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.840 
that was maybe dropped in the payload

missions<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.280> something<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.610> happens

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
missions is this something that happens

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.700 
missions is this something that happens
frequently<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:56.600> just<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:57.500> wrong

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
frequently and it's just not wrong

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.620 
frequently and it's just not wrong
occasionally<00:02:58.550> I'm<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.820> my<00:02:58.970> second<00:02:59.390> mission

occasionally I'm on my second mission
which<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.900> first<00:03:00.050> flight<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.380> Endeavour

one<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.040> these<00:03:01.160> floated<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.670> about<00:03:02.450> four<00:03:02.750> hours

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
one of these floated up about four hours

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.960 
one of these floated up about four hours
after<00:03:03.380> we<00:03:03.920> opened<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.520> paley<00:03:04.700> I've<00:03:04.850> been

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
after we opened the paley I've been

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.150 
after we opened the paley I've been
looking<00:03:05.210> for<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.420> house<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.440> Allen<00:03:06.740> wrench<00:03:06.770> I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
looking for that house an Allen wrench I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.470 
looking for that house an Allen wrench I
wondered<00:03:07.580> who<00:03:07.700> watched<00:03:07.940> him<00:03:08.120> yeah<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.360> was

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
wondered who watched him yeah it was

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.180 
wondered who watched him yeah it was
made<00:03:08.660> your<00:03:09.110> head<00:03:09.320> we're<00:03:09.470> gonna<00:03:09.560> my<00:03:09.710> tail<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:10.010> it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
made your head we're gonna my tail is it

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.620 
made your head we're gonna my tail is it
there's<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.610> big<00:03:10.760> fine<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:11.540> you

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
there's a big fine for that when you

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.290 
there's a big fine for that when you
lose<00:03:11.780> these<00:03:11.960> things<00:03:12.170> aboard<00:03:12.350> spacecraft<00:03:12.680> huh

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
lose these things aboard spacecraft huh

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.720 
lose these things aboard spacecraft huh
was<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.450> yours<00:03:14.890> no<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.400> was<00:03:16.520> actually

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
was that yours no it was actually

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.130 
was that yours no it was actually
dropped<00:03:17.120> by<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.300> worker<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.690> think<00:03:17.930> when<00:03:18.050> they're

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
dropped by a worker I think when they're

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.140 
dropped by a worker I think when they're
constructing<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.830> official<00:03:19.370> whole<00:03:19.820> new<00:03:19.970> look

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
constructing the official whole new look

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.490 
constructing the official whole new look
for<00:03:20.330> these<00:03:20.420> things<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:20.930> they<00:03:21.020> can't<00:03:21.230> find

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
for these things but they can't find

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.660 
for these things but they can't find
them<00:03:21.590> sometimes<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.040> they<00:03:22.160> just<00:03:22.340> happen<00:03:22.580> to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
them sometimes and they just happen to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.460 
them sometimes and they just happen to
float<00:03:22.880> up<00:03:23.030> oh<00:03:23.239> that's<00:03:23.989> like<00:03:24.110> leaving<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
float up oh that's like leaving the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.650 
float up oh that's like leaving the
knife<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.130> know<00:03:25.250> even<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.360> someones

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
knife and then you know even in someones

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.100 
knife and then you know even in someones
belly<00:03:26.959> that's<00:03:27.830> not<00:03:28.010> good<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.850> should<00:03:29.750> we<00:03:29.780> be

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
belly that's not good so should we be

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.840 
belly that's not good so should we be

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
first you know I'm a little nervous I

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.130 
first you know I'm a little nervous I
gotta<00:03:37.489> tell<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.570> they've<00:03:38.810> done<00:03:38.959> what

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
gotta tell you I think they've done what

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.210 
gotta tell you I think they've done what
they<00:03:39.260> need<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.470> do<00:03:39.620> they<00:03:39.770> did<00:03:39.920> an<00:03:40.010> inspection

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
they need to do they did an inspection

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.400 
they need to do they did an inspection
of<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.640> orbiter<00:03:40.970> both<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.660> underside<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.320> in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
of the orbiter both the underside and in

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.290 
of the orbiter both the underside and in
the<00:03:42.500> payload<00:03:42.830> Bay<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.580> two<00:03:43.910> things<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.209> have

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
the payload Bay the two things you have

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.460 
the payload Bay the two things you have
to<00:03:44.360> be<00:03:44.450> concerned<00:03:44.720> about<00:03:44.870> again<00:03:45.230> are<00:03:45.350> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
to be concerned about again are the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.470 
to be concerned about again are the
high-speed<00:03:45.980> impacts<00:03:46.790> which<00:03:47.030> doesn't<00:03:47.390> look

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
high-speed impacts which doesn't look

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.520 
high-speed impacts which doesn't look
like<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.780> would<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.020> problem<00:03:48.290> right<00:03:48.470> now

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
like that would be a problem right now

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.320 
like that would be a problem right now
the<00:03:49.190> second<00:03:49.550> thing<00:03:49.580> is<00:03:49.820> it<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.060> piece<00:03:50.300> of

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
the second thing is it is a piece of

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.360 
the second thing is it is a piece of
orbiter<00:03:50.840> that's<00:03:50.959> critical<00:03:51.470> hardware<00:03:51.890> that

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
orbiter that's critical hardware that

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.250 
orbiter that's critical hardware that
you<00:03:52.550> need<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.910> operate<00:03:53.330> say<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> payload<00:03:54.140> bay

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
you need to operate say the payload bay

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.390 
you need to operate say the payload bay
doors<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.800> latch<00:03:54.980> them<00:03:55.190> down<00:03:55.370> i

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
doors and the latch them down i

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.760 
doors and the latch them down i
seriously<00:03:56.000> doubt<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.600> case<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
seriously doubt that's the case so the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.720 
seriously doubt that's the case so the
thing<00:03:57.920> is<00:03:57.950> they're<00:03:58.190> not<00:03:58.340> going<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.489> stop

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
thing is they're not going to stop

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.070 
thing is they're not going to stop
trying<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.000> figure<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.330> out<00:03:59.510> once<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.959> or

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
trying to figure this out once the or

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.479 
trying to figure this out once the or
girl<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.440> you're<00:04:00.650> gonna<00:04:00.770> come<00:04:01.100> back<00:04:01.250> and

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
girl and you're gonna come back and

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.860 
girl and you're gonna come back and
you'll<00:04:01.610> try<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> figure<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.150> out<00:04:02.270> up<00:04:02.570> here<00:04:02.690> i

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
you'll try to figure it out up here i

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.210 
you'll try to figure it out up here i
want<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.170> jump<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.410> because<00:04:03.470> julia<00:04:03.830> had<00:04:04.190> a

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
want to jump in because julia had a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.860 
want to jump in because julia had a
better<00:04:04.489> question<00:04:04.880> but<00:04:05.000> i<00:04:05.030> want<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.540> jump<00:04:05.720> in

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
better question but i want to jump in

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.080 
better question but i want to jump in
here<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.500> okay<00:04:06.709> let's<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.790> there<00:04:07.970> was

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
here so okay let's do if there was

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.900 
here so okay let's do if there was
trouble<00:04:08.680> could<00:04:09.680> atlantis<00:04:10.250> get<00:04:10.489> back<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.820> the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
trouble could atlantis get back to the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.729 
trouble could atlantis get back to the
space<00:04:11.150> station<00:04:11.300> do<00:04:12.200> they<00:04:12.320> have<00:04:12.410> enough<00:04:12.500> fuel

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
space station do they have enough fuel

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.009 
space station do they have enough fuel
to<00:04:12.830> do<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.519> if<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:13.850> do<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.360> soy<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.810> is

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
to do that and if they do the soy is is

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.770 
to do that and if they do the soy is is
already<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.350> their<00:04:15.470> parking<00:04:15.680> spot<00:04:16.130> who<00:04:16.940> would

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
already in their parking spot who would

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.849 
already in their parking spot who would
they<00:04:17.900> have<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.109> back<00:04:18.260> out<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.470> get<00:04:18.650> out<00:04:18.709> of

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
they have to back out and get out of

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.500 
they have to back out and get out of
there<00:04:19.010> well<00:04:19.519> they're<00:04:19.910> probably<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.270> bit<00:04:20.419> about

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
there well they're probably a bit about

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.150 
there well they're probably a bit about
debate<00:04:20.870> what<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.140> do<00:04:21.260> this<00:04:21.410> early<00:04:21.770> you're<00:04:21.890> on<00:04:22.070> a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
debate what to do this early you're on a

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.580 
debate what to do this early you're on a
fuel<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.660> Sawyer's<00:04:23.990> may<00:04:24.169> have<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.410> go<00:04:24.500> to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
fuel and the Sawyer's may have to go to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.870 
fuel and the Sawyer's may have to go to
the<00:04:24.740> docking<00:04:24.979> porter<00:04:25.340> they<00:04:25.430> might<00:04:25.580> just

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
the docking porter they might just

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.430 
the docking porter they might just
to<00:04:26.000> have<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.270> soya<00:04:26.480> there's<00:04:27.020> more<00:04:27.140> than<00:04:27.290> one

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
to have the soya there's more than one

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.860 
to have the soya there's more than one
docking<00:04:27.830> port<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.460> station<00:04:28.820> there's<00:04:29.690> more

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
docking port on the station there's more

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.660 
docking port on the station there's more
than<00:04:30.020> one<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.380> they<00:04:30.500> might<00:04:30.620> not<00:04:30.680> associate

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
than one but they might not associate

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.810 
than one but they might not associate
with<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:32.630> yard<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.140> all<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.670> so<00:04:34.670> you're

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
with it so yard and all that so you're
