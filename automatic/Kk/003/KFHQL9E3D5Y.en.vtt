almost jarring to be honest with it just
looks<00:00:39.149> fantastic<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.770> being<00:00:41.040> said<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
looks fantastic now that being said you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
looks fantastic now that being said you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
second on YouTube until you tube allows

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.680

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
second so in reality there's not going

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.260 
second so in reality there's not going
to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> whole<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.680> difference<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.699> my

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

old<00:00:54.539> videos<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.110> new<00:00:55.289> videos<00:00:55.590> until

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
old videos in my new videos until

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
old videos in my new videos until
YouTube<00:00:56.969> changes<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:58.260> say

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
YouTube changes that and they say

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
YouTube changes that and they say
they're<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.489> haven't

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.740> shown<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.189> YouTube

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
the way I want it to be shown on YouTube

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
the way I want it to be shown on YouTube
and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.890> takes<00:01:53.250> experimentation

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and you know that takes experimentation

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.260 
and you know that takes experimentation
and<00:01:54.210> since<00:01:54.869> I've<00:01:55.049> got<00:01:55.200> brand<00:01:55.619> new<00:01:56.270> recording

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and since I've got brand new recording

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.620 
and since I've got brand new recording
hardware<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.110> capture<00:01:58.350> HD<00:01:58.500> 60

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
hardware with the game capture HD 60

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.219 
hardware with the game capture HD 60
it's<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> take<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:00.990> more

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's going to take some more

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's going to take some more
experimentation<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
experimentation but and this is one of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
experimentation but and this is one of
those<00:02:03.180> experiments<00:02:03.750> frankly<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.439> want<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
those experiments frankly is I want to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.459 
those experiments frankly is I want to
see<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> looks<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.290> compared<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> what

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
see what it looks like compared to what

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.290 
see what it looks like compared to what
it<00:02:07.619> looks<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:07.979> my<00:02:08.160> computer<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.759> youtube

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it looks like on my computer on youtube

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.130 
it looks like on my computer on youtube
so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.540 
so
I've<00:02:10.200> been<00:02:10.350> playing<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.130> little<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I've been playing with a little bit of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.860 
I've been playing with a little bit of
footage<00:02:11.910> today<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.240> know<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.690> I've<00:02:12.750> been

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
footage today you know and I've been

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.500 
footage today you know and I've been
playing<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.800> game<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.910> trying<00:02:15.180> out<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
playing the game just trying out the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
playing the game just trying out the
software<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.110> getting<00:02:16.650> used<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.280> new

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
software and getting used to the new

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210 
software and getting used to the new
features<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> far<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.709> really<00:02:19.860> happy

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
features and so far I'm really happy

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.520 
features and so far I'm really happy
with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.550> new<00:02:20.670> features<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> swear<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.720> god<00:02:22.200> I'm

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
with the new features I swear to god I'm

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.940 
with the new features I swear to god I'm
so<00:02:23.010> surprised<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.819> doesn't<00:02:23.910> take<00:02:24.209> longer<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
so surprised it doesn't take longer to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
so surprised it doesn't take longer to
convert<00:02:25.950> movie<00:02:26.520> files<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.209> now<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.630> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
convert movie files that now that there

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.930 
convert movie files that now that there
are<00:02:27.840> 60<00:02:28.080> frames<00:02:28.290> per<00:02:28.380> second<00:02:28.740> i'm<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:29.070> sure

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
are 60 frames per second i'm not sure

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000 
are 60 frames per second i'm not sure
why<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.320> definitely<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:31.950> is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
why that is it's definitely this is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.699 
why that is it's definitely this is
definitely<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.670> 60<00:02:33.240> frames<00:02:33.570> per<00:02:33.780> second<00:02:34.380> video

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
definitely a 60 frames per second video

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.100 
definitely a 60 frames per second video
I<00:02:35.070> can<00:02:35.580> actually<00:02:35.940> count<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> frames<00:02:36.870> like

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
I can actually count the frames like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.870 
I can actually count the frames like
that<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.470> something<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> capability

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
that is something I have the capability

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.570 
that is something I have the capability
to<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.810> I'm<00:02:39.900> quite<00:02:40.319> positive<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.250> 60

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
to do so I'm quite positive this is 60

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.320 
to do so I'm quite positive this is 60
frames<00:02:41.819> per<00:02:41.910> second<00:02:42.620> why<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:44.010> not<00:02:44.430> making<00:02:45.120> my

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
frames per second why it's not making my

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.360 
frames per second why it's not making my
computer<00:02:45.870> buckle<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:47.250> surprising

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
computer buckle is a little surprising

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.729 
computer buckle is a little surprising
to<00:02:47.910> me<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.239> right<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.959> maybe<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.470> that

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
to me all right and maybe it's just that

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.350 
to me all right and maybe it's just that
I<00:02:49.769> don't<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.310> as<00:02:50.580> smart<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.090> thought<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
I don't I'm not as smart as I thought I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.750 
I don't I'm not as smart as I thought I
was<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.930> assumed<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.590> 60<00:02:53.459> frames<00:02:53.670> per

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
was I just assumed that 60 frames per

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.350 
was I just assumed that 60 frames per
second<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> four<00:02:54.959> year<00:02:55.170> old<00:02:55.730> laptop<00:02:56.730> was

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
second on a four year old laptop was

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.699 
second on a four year old laptop was
going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> cause<00:02:57.780> an<00:02:57.959> issue<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.440> really

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
going to cause an issue but it's really

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.590 
going to cause an issue but it's really
not<00:02:58.980> i'm<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.220> surprised<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.239> el<00:03:00.420> gato

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
not i'm really surprised that el gato

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.009 
not i'm really surprised that el gato
was<00:03:00.900> able<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.380> get<00:03:02.269> 60<00:03:03.269> frames<00:03:03.450> per<00:03:03.540> second

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
was able to get 60 frames per second

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.530 
was able to get 60 frames per second
through<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.800> USB<00:03:05.280> connection<00:03:05.880> USB<00:03:06.300> 2.0

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.810 
through the USB connection USB 2.0
connection<00:03:07.380> i<00:03:07.500> thought<00:03:08.160> for<00:03:08.400> sure<00:03:08.430> they<00:03:08.730> were

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
connection i thought for sure they were

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.550 
connection i thought for sure they were
going<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.480> whatever<00:03:09.750> media<00:03:10.350> had

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
going to have to do whatever media had

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.560 
going to have to do whatever media had
done<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.070> go<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.519> USB<00:03:12.510> 3.0<00:03:13.260> or<00:03:13.489> Thunderbolt

done and go up to USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.180 
done and go up to USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt
but<00:03:15.570> they<00:03:15.690> did<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.049> USB<00:03:16.380> 2.0<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.040> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
but they did it with USB 2.0 and it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.039 
but they did it with USB 2.0 and it
works<00:03:17.430> fantastic<00:03:17.549> or<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.390> working<00:03:18.690> great<00:03:18.810> on

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049

you<00:03:38.310> know<00:03:38.489> my<00:03:38.610> computer<00:03:38.940> can<00:03:39.090> hitch<00:03:39.209> up<00:03:39.420> every

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you know my computer can hitch up every

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.840 
you know my computer can hitch up every
once<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> while<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.040> does<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.340> play<00:03:41.640> as

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
once in a while and it does not play as

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.000 
once in a while and it does not play as
fluidly<00:03:42.269> as<00:03:42.480> I'd<00:03:42.630> like<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.110> but

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
fluidly as I'd like it to but

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.030 
fluidly as I'd like it to but
everything's<00:03:44.940> going<00:03:45.239> well<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.540> I'm<00:03:46.530> having<00:03:46.860> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
everything's going well I'm I'm having a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.420 
everything's going well I'm I'm having a
good<00:03:47.250> time<00:03:47.310> with<00:03:47.579> this<00:03:47.940> HD<00:03:48.360> 60<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.019> far<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:50.280> I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
good time with this HD 60 so far like I

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.250 
good time with this HD 60 so far like I
said<00:03:50.489> still<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.239> contrast<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> contrast

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
said still the contrast the contrast

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.319 
said still the contrast the contrast
looks<00:03:52.440> funny<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.950> me<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
looks funny to me you can see the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.000 
looks funny to me you can see the
brights<00:03:54.630> are<00:03:54.870> probably<00:03:55.170> too<00:03:55.410> bright<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
brights are probably too bright and the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.720 
brights are probably too bright and the
darks<00:03:56.940> are<00:03:57.180> probably<00:03:57.750> too<00:03:58.079> dark<00:03:59.540> now<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:01.730> can

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
darks are probably too dark now I can

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.840 
darks are probably too dark now I can
probably<00:04:03.209> fix<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.739> elgato<00:04:05.190> software

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
probably fix that in the elgato software

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.020 
probably fix that in the elgato software
so<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.690> shouldn't<00:04:07.230> be<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.440> problem<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.640> this

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
so that shouldn't be a problem and this

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.650 
so that shouldn't be a problem and this
the<00:04:09.510> colors<00:04:09.840> look<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.109> little<00:04:10.230> bit<00:04:10.440> off<00:04:10.590> too

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
the colors look a little bit off too

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.449 
the colors look a little bit off too
it's<00:04:12.660> more<00:04:13.200> than<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.500> saturation<00:04:14.310> they

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it's more than just saturation they

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.759 
it's more than just saturation they
don't<00:04:14.730> look<00:04:15.000> quite<00:04:15.060> right<00:04:15.359> like<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.380> colors

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
don't look quite right like the colors

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.870 
don't look quite right like the colors
are<00:04:16.979> not<00:04:17.359> correct<00:04:18.410> which<00:04:19.410> also<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:20.400> be<00:04:20.459> fixed

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
are not correct which also can be fixed

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.969 
are not correct which also can be fixed
at<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.109> recording<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.650> elgato

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
at the time recording with the elgato

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:23.960 
at the time recording with the elgato
software

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
software

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.170 
software
so<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.420> know<00:04:24.810> color<00:04:25.110> correction<00:04:25.590> aside<00:04:26.180> 60

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
so you know color correction aside 60

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.750 
so you know color correction aside 60
frames<00:04:27.390> per<00:04:27.480> second<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.160> its<00:04:29.160> marvelous<00:04:29.550> I
