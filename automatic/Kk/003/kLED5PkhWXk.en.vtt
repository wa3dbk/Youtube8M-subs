so these are really creamy and I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569

definitely purchase it again and this is
about<00:00:59.879> 350<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.010> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
about 350 I think and you can get in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.509 
about 350 I think and you can get in
most<00:01:02.969> chemists<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> them<00:01:05.400> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
most chemists I don't you get them in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
most chemists I don't you get them in
chemist<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.330> Don<00:01:06.540> stores<00:01:06.900> sometimes

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
chemist and I think Don stores sometimes

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.390 
chemist and I think Don stores sometimes
system<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.070> LA<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:11.010> next

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
system is LA so that's that one the next

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
system is LA so that's that one the next
is<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.880> wet<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> wild<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.990> neither<00:01:13.740> glue

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is my wet and wild and neither glue

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
aluminum bronze powder and I think this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.880 
aluminum bronze powder and I think this
is<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.310> perfect<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:19.380> highlighting<00:01:19.770> your
