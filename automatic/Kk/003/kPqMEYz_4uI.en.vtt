00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 electronic products and the 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 technology are an integral part of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.690
 our daily life tablet 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.740
 digital camera printers 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.510
 the list is long and our 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 consumption does not slow down with the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.710
 more than 80 % of Canadians surveyed 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 have at least one device 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 electronic finally a girl and he we 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.330
 do not want these old devices 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.830
 accumulate in the sites 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.930
 landfill or wish to export 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 illegally thus moving the stakes 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.670
 environmental or otherwise to avoid 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.199
 that this happen in the future we 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 need to recycle our devices 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.800
 today we are the association 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.870
 for product recycling 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.910
 electronic a non-profit organization 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.290
 profit- driven industry that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 coordinates recycling programs 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.860
 regulated across the country 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 so that these products end of life 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 useful be treated safely 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.550
 on and ecological through our programs 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 one hundred thousand metric tons of products 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 obsolete electronics is about the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.120
 weight of 20 and the elephant avoids the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 landfills every year here are 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.719
 how does it work products 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 end-of-life electronics and they are 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.320
 made in deposit points 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 official arpp is ecocentres 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 retail businesses 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.619
 special collections that total more 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 thousand years ranking in the country 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.040
 the products are then sent to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 specialized recyclers audited and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 approved the latest technologies 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 are used to dismount the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.420
 devices and thus collect 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.280
 raw materials such as glass 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 plastic and precious metals 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.880
 like gold and copper 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.619
 substances of concern such as 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 mercury and lead are also treated 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 responsibly to protect at 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.710
 both the environment the health and the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 safety of the workers who 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.549
 manipulate the recovered materials are 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 then reinserted into the chain of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 production is used to make 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.799
 new products by bringing your 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.689
 old electronic products 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.520
 unusable at the point of official deposit 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.840
 of art you make sure that they do not 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.850
 do not end up in es7 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 landfill that does not export 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.899
 illegally that is not handled 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.759
 by negligent recyclers and that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.479
 valuable resources are recovered 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.159
 and recycled 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.420
 then reintegrated into the chain of 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.070
 production 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.930
 today it is impossible 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 to consider a world without products 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.869
 electronic 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 together make sure that they are 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.930
 just as impossible to envision a 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.580
 world where electronic products 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.170
 obsolete accumulate in sites 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.540
 landfill and harm our 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 environment for a healthier future 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.200
 recycling responsibly 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.890
 electronic products of which we 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 let's take advantage today
