00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
trained for yeah and you to me it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.659

using the skills you get trained for

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.349 
using the skills you get trained for
communication<00:01:55.669> skills<00:01:55.999> are<00:01:56.209> really

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
communication skills are really

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.569 
communication skills are really
important<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.740> mean<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:59.049> think<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.289> that

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
important and I mean I think that that

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.370 
important and I mean I think that that
isn't<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:01.789> with<00:02:01.969> patients<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:02.779> think<00:02:03.079> we

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
isn't just with patients I think we

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.989 
isn't just with patients I think we
don't<00:02:03.560> concentrate<00:02:03.799> perhaps<00:02:04.399> enough<00:02:04.700> with

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
don't concentrate perhaps enough with

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.290 
don't concentrate perhaps enough with
how<00:02:05.659> do<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:06.079> generate<00:02:06.649> your<00:02:07.039> team<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:08.149> with

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
how do you generate your team your with

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.729 
how do you generate your team your with
to<00:02:08.599> do<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.899> things<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.200> want<00:02:09.380> them<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.590> do

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
skills okay good I think being a med reg

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.960 
skills okay good I think being a med reg
is<00:02:27.720> massively<00:02:28.200> being<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.620> team<00:02:28.860> player<00:02:29.460> isn't

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
is massively being a team player isn't

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
is massively being a team player isn't
it<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.550> not<00:02:32.760> always<00:02:33.410> high

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it and it's and it's not always high

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.470 
it and it's and it's not always high
drama<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.340> you've<00:02:35.460> got<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.210> like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
drama but you've got to kind of like

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.250 
drama but you've got to kind of like
that<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.770> there<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.640> are<00:02:38.700> some

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
that because there is there are some

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.650 
that because there is there are some
edge-of-your-seat<00:02:40.340> moments<00:02:41.340> yeah<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.270> guess

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
edge-of-your-seat moments yeah I guess

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.730 
edge-of-your-seat moments yeah I guess
that's<00:02:42.810> something<00:02:42.960> we<00:02:43.140> haven't<00:02:43.290> talked<00:02:43.590> about

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
that's something we haven't talked about

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.590 
that's something we haven't talked about
very<00:02:44.640> much<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:45.180> how<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.740> how<00:02:47.100> nice<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.570> be

have<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> couple<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.410> key<00:03:07.590> moments<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> have

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
have a couple of key moments that have

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.570 
have a couple of key moments that have
been<00:03:08.520> your<00:03:08.700> best<00:03:10.250> strangely<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.400> quite

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
been your best strangely it's quite

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860 
been your best strangely it's quite
macabre<00:03:11.940> isn't<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.300> they're<00:03:12.450> probably<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
macabre isn't it they're probably the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
macabre isn't it they're probably the
worst<00:03:13.050> moments<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.640> you've<00:03:14.760> been<00:03:14.940> through

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and that's that's the medical psyche

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.650 
and that's that's the medical psyche
maybe<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.490> can<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.180> remember<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:18.570> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
maybe I can really remember but it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.080

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.990 
nice as the Med wedge to be able to
spend<00:03:31.260> time<00:03:31.440> with<00:03:31.680> patients<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.640> often<00:03:32.760> with

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
spend time with patients and often with

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.420 
spend time with patients and often with
their<00:03:33.209> families<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.020> hour<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.680> distress

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
their families in the hour of distress

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.180 
their families in the hour of distress
and<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.720> probably<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.560> was<00:03:37.740> one<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
and I think probably that was one of the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.500 
and I think probably that was one of the
things<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.520> like<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.730> most<00:03:38.880> going<00:03:39.300> from

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
things I like the most going from

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.350 
things I like the most going from
sh-show<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.050> registrar<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.850> could<00:03:42.060> see

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
sh-show to registrar is you could see

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.330 
sh-show to registrar is you could see
that<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.870> really<00:03:43.200> important<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:44.010> talk<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
that it was really important to talk to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.880

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
difficult circumstance was about to

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.270 
difficult circumstance was about to
happen<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.620> could<00:03:49.860> build<00:03:50.040> a

happen and you could build a

I've had definitely some bad days but

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.550 
I've had definitely some bad days but
the<00:05:18.610> good<00:05:18.820> days<00:05:19.020> definitely<00:05:20.020> outweigh<00:05:20.350> them

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
the good days definitely outweigh them

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.390 
the good days definitely outweigh them
