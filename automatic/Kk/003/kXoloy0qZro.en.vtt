00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 mountains snow smooth roads dreamlike 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.069
 conditions for the new golf ago 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.590
 motion in kitzbühel provides volkswagen 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 his latest all-wheel-model before the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 permanent four-wheel drive in golf 7 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.550
 is one of the most modern and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 most efficient systems of this kind in the 6th 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.310
 We also had very good golf 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.869
 four-wheel drive strand 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 we were able to improve again 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the area of ​​the haldex coupling 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.189
 maybe there are in the new one 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.490
 generation 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 We were able to save 14 kilos weight here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.180
 and driving dynamics we could through the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.710
 use of the xds at the front and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.590
 the rear axle still clear 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.210
 make it more agile 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 the intelligently controlled four-wheel system 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 4motion reacts extremely fast to all 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 conceivable driving influences of ice 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 Kurden steep climbs the four-wheel system 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.420
 He knows the situation and intervenes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.480
 it distributes the power according to need 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.840
 all four wheels lose an example 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.730
 The front axle on ice at traction 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 The four-wheel drive responds immediately 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 and increases over the Haldex coupling the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.960
 Driving forces of the rear axle after 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 this lightning-fast intervention drives this 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.330
 Car safely over the slippery spot 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.250
 and something new is the golf before 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.380
 motion comes standard with one 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 electronic cross lock for the front 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.009
 and rear axle to the customer 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 xd it improves the driving dynamics 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 the xds we can clear the vehicle 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 make agile that means at fast 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 driven curves we brake the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 turn inside wheels and thereby 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.290
 We can put torque on the outside 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.420
 bring wheels and so turns the vehicle 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 into the curve easier and becomes 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.189
 therefore very handy gerd salvenmoser 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 has 40 years of host of rübezahl 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.979
 alm 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.799
 Every day he drives the five kilometers 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.259
 long forest way up to everything at every 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.259
 weather for us he has the new golf ago 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.399
 motion tested synonymous where else only 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 Skiers on the road are right 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.530
 bad conditions 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.310
 is partly really muddy and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.760
 traveling and the cart pulls is thrown 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.000
 overriding on the transports believe 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.319
 really good 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 especially impressed gerd salvenmoser 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.770
 like the allrad golf steep passages 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.319
 Master it is just amazing 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.420
 you with the sonata gold again 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.430
 curves with the second gear loose 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 can pull through 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.850
 that was not normal before going through 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:43.550
 like nothing easier to drift over and he 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:45.989
 Attracts like a 300 ps on class 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.239
 the golf before motion 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.110
 He takes adverse road conditions 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.110
 the scare
