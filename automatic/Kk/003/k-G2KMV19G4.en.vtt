00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 and so friends who hello who 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.730
 interested in equipment and device 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.549
 wagon you here today I will 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.740
 talk about such a device as a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.080
 our invasion is set right here 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 so it serves to automatically 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 pressure control 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.090
 here earlier after each loading and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.420
 unloading 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 had to rearrange the situation 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 empty when he is empty 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.820
 position is reduced when you he was 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 infected 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.219
 that is, after counting each unload and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.710
 loading had to do it differently 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.590
 together not to rearrange the lit 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.360
 empty after graduate 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.190
 Bush basked and appeared slides 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.460
 navara 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.940
 that is, it was necessary to follow this 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.280
 now when auto mode is set 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.720
 already disappears 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.720
 will send auto regulates itself 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.970
 by when the springs are compressed and when 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.360
 loading is automatically supervised 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.250
 push so the requirements for 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 the author means the pipes themselves that go 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:33.080
 must be fixed at least two 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 ground sour cream 2 and 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:44.960
 mount itself auto mode here it should 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.210
 fastened with 4 bolts not securely 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.890
 dangle through rubber seals 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.860
 Is the nut tightened diagonally? 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.450
 so that there are no leaks also these two 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.869
 bolts must also be secure 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 secured looking not hanging out 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:09.119
 about. your such here it is. 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.530
 she should be looking out 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.280
 not less than 2 millimeters from the case ie 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 condition to learn about. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 if she comes in means disposal 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.459
 on the right, that is, we have to arrange it 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.379
 farther 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.819
 between the rod of their contact bar too 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.739
 it should be a gap from zero to three 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.879
 millimeters adjust this gap 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.470
 M12 bolted plates 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:45.780
 length 60 mm 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 power on must be inserted thick 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.730
 from one and a half to five millimeters no more 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.970
 5 pieces here this contact plan means 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.299
 here these plates are set availability 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.459
 some kind of homemade plates or 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 leaning on something is forbidden 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.079
 stock should be about 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.690
 in the middle of this bar 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:15.230
 either so that the distance to 0 to the edge was 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.500
 not less than 50 millimeters 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.200
 the contact strip itself is rigidly fixed 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.370
 on a stick dragging bolted bolts 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.769
 homemade bolts 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.810
 and should not be that is bolts long 90 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.919
 millimeters 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.609
 mounted nut eshkin tom as you see 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.989
 straight planet 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.510
 very bad and the distance between the nut and 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.889
 support beam ie sidewall from 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.079
 form the sidewall surface should be 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.750
 from three to five millimeters to herself 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.490
 shell 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.180
 rotated that is quietly moved 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:02.360
 shells itself which is fastened between 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.510
 the sides of the carts should fit on 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.290
 rubber metal 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.380
 for such supplies means to regulate 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.310
 the rod itself cannot be that is cannot be removed 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:19.370
 regulates love here only on when 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.900
 the presence of such a paris switch 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.770
 on 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.140
 air distributor must be located 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.740
 only in the middle position but here in 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.070
 principle such requirements for cars 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070
 regime 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.010
 Thanks for watching my channel 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.639
 subscribe put likes 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.639
 will be still vilo 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.710
 Thank you all for seeing us
