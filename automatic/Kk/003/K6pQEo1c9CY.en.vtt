I'm<00:00:00.480> actually<00:00:00.829> slightly<00:00:01.829> annoyed<00:00:02.399> that<00:00:02.429> I'm

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I'm actually slightly annoyed that I'm

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.880 
I'm actually slightly annoyed that I'm
making<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:04.290> I've<00:00:04.620> already

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
making this video now I've already

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.280 
making this video now I've already
talked<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.150> topic<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.839> people

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
talked about the topic of people

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.530 
talked about the topic of people
believing<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.830> dinosaurs<00:00:08.550> did<00:00:08.880> not<00:00:09.030> exist

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
believing that dinosaurs did not exist

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.620 
believing that dinosaurs did not exist
but<00:00:10.230> recently<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.280> saw<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> video<00:00:12.120> where<00:00:12.300> there

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
but recently I saw a video where there

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.810 
but recently I saw a video where there
was<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.870> woman<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.679> arguing<00:00:14.460> that

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
was this woman that was arguing that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.779 
was this woman that was arguing that
parent<00:00:15.299> ology<00:00:15.870> would<00:00:16.109> speak<00:00:16.500> I'd<00:00:17.010> say<00:00:17.460> because

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
parent ology would speak I'd say because

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.120 
parent ology would speak I'd say because
of<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.060> I've<00:00:18.180> decided<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> argue<00:00:19.439> against

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of that I've decided to argue against

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.570 
of that I've decided to argue against
her<00:00:20.310> views<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:21.119> paleontology<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:23.189> put<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
her views on paleontology I have put the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040 
her views on paleontology I have put the
link<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.420> video<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> description

but<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.369> thing<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.000> obvious

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but at the first thing that's obvious

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.970 
but at the first thing that's obvious
when<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.260> video<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
when you see this video is that this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
when you see this video is that this
woman<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.599> knowledge<00:00:30.960> on

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
woman has very little knowledge on

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.540 
woman has very little knowledge on
geology<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.700> paleontology<00:00:33.829> she<00:00:34.829> says<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
geology and paleontology she says that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.510 
geology and paleontology she says that
if<00:00:35.880> rocks<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.840> millions<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.320> years<00:00:37.380> old<00:00:37.920> they

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
if rocks for millions of years old they

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.729 
if rocks for millions of years old they
would<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> center<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> earth<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
would be in the center of the earth it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
would be in the center of the earth it
was<00:00:41.010> obvious<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> she<00:00:41.850> did<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.450> understand

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
was obvious that she did not understand

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
was obvious that she did not understand
the<00:00:43.440> erosion<00:00:44.160> process<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> happens<00:00:45.059> over

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the erosion process that happens over

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
the erosion process that happens over
millions<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> years<00:00:46.170> after<00:00:46.649> rocks<00:00:47.550> being

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
millions of years after rocks being

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
millions of years after rocks being
deposited<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.230> allow<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.590> exposure<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
deposited to allow the exposure of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.110 
deposited to allow the exposure of
fossils<00:00:51.829> another<00:00:52.829> points<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.610> said<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
fossils another points he said was that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290 
fossils another points he said was that
fossils<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.230> only<00:00:55.649> found<00:00:56.070> by<00:00:56.340> parent<00:00:56.789> ologist

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
fossils are only found by parent ologist

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
fossils are only found by parent ologist
and<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.719> pale<00:00:57.960> intelligence<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.550> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and so pale intelligence make it up but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
and so pale intelligence make it up but
that<00:01:00.239> isn't<00:01:00.660> true<00:01:01.070> believe<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.489> most

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that isn't true believe it or not most

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.870 
that isn't true believe it or not most
of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> time<00:01:03.619> normal<00:01:04.619> people<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.580> find

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
of the time normal people actually find

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
of the time normal people actually find
fossils<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> time<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.590> were

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
fossils a lot of the time they were

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.179 
fossils a lot of the time they were
farmers<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.299> tourists<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.950> are

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
farmers there are tourists and there are

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
farmers there are tourists and there are
of<00:01:11.460> course<00:01:11.490> fossil<00:01:12.210> hunters<00:01:12.600> fossil<00:01:13.380> hunters

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of course fossil hunters fossil hunters

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.700 
of course fossil hunters fossil hunters
are<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.950> always<00:01:14.490> paying<00:01:15.030> ontology<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
are not always paying ontology and so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
are not always paying ontology and so
they<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> areas<00:01:18.240> where<00:01:18.270> they

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
they actually go out to areas where they

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
they actually go out to areas where they
know<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.170> chance<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.590> finding

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
know there's a good chance of finding

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.999 
know there's a good chance of finding
fossils<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.939> called<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.330> locality<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
fossils it's called a locality and so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
fossils it's called a locality and so
because<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.570> able<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.020> find

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
because of this we are able to find

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
because of this we are able to find
fossils<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.360> parent<00:01:27.780> ologist

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
fossils and that is how parent ologist

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
fossils and that is how parent ologist
are<00:01:28.470> able<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.220> into<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.850> particular<00:01:30.240> area<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
are able to go into a particular area to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.249 
are able to go into a particular area to
find<00:01:31.409> fossils<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> Nova<00:01:33.360> points<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:33.900> made<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
find fossils and Nova points he made is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
find fossils and Nova points he made is
that<00:01:34.290> movies<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.040> Jurassic<00:01:35.640> Park<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:36.150> shows

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that movies like Jurassic Park in shows

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
that movies like Jurassic Park in shows
that<00:01:36.689> I've<00:01:36.840> been<00:01:36.960> made<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.560> related<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that I've been made that are related to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
that I've been made that are related to
dinosaurs<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.939> power<00:01:39.150> ontology<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
dinosaurs and power ontology and I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.889 
dinosaurs and power ontology and I
actually<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.579> made<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
actually just made to make a lot of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.039 
actually just made to make a lot of
profit<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> irony<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.880> safe<00:01:45.360> thick<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
profit but the irony was safe thick you

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
profit but the irony was safe thick you
could<00:01:46.229> cut<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> knife<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.280> she<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
could cut it with a knife because she is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
could cut it with a knife because she is
actually<00:01:47.939> making<00:01:48.450> money<00:01:48.960> from<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.890> video<00:01:50.310> by

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
actually making money from this video by

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.840 
actually making money from this video by
talking<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.780> verbiage<00:01:52.490> from<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.670> I've

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
talking about verbiage from what I've

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
talking about verbiage from what I've
seen<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.659> appears<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.500> she<00:01:55.680> sits<00:01:55.979> down

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
seen it just appears that she sits down

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.639 
seen it just appears that she sits down
in<00:01:56.460> front<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> camera<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.689> without<00:01:58.259> doing

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
in front of a camera and without doing

realize that dinosaurs did not just

realize that dinosaurs did not just
exist<00:02:46.769> they<00:02:47.250> still<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:48.090> exist<00:02:49.010> dinosaurs<00:02:50.010> are

birds<00:02:50.939> in<00:02:51.389> fact<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:53.069> truth<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.060> some

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
birds in fact it is the truth but some

birds in fact it is the truth but some
people<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.709> accept<00:02:56.250> that

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
people do not want to accept that

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.020 
people do not want to accept that
because<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:57.329> our<00:02:57.450> kinds<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.169> reasons<00:02:58.379> and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
because of our kinds of reasons and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.780 
because of our kinds of reasons and
really<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.510> firm<00:03:01.109> enough<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.519> sit

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
really that is firm enough but to sit

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.640 
really that is firm enough but to sit
down<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.359> front<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:03.719> a<00:03:03.810> camera<00:03:04.049> where<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.469> have

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
down in front of a camera where you have

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.459 
down in front of a camera where you have
to<00:03:04.799> know<00:03:05.189> research<00:03:05.849> on<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.569> topic<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.319> are

to know research on the topic you are

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.339 
to know research on the topic you are
against<00:03:08.159> is<00:03:08.310> really<00:03:09.090> bad<00:03:09.329> now<00:03:10.109> I<00:03:10.139> have

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
against is really bad now I have

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.229 
against is really bad now I have
actually<00:03:10.950> had<00:03:11.129> people<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.609> are<00:03:11.790> called<00:03:11.969> me<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
actually had people that are called me a

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.270 
actually had people that are called me a
idiot<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.019> ideas<00:03:13.469> a<00:03:13.500> dinosaur<00:03:14.099> growth

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
idiot on my ideas a dinosaur growth

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.569 
idiot on my ideas a dinosaur growth
stages<00:03:14.639> but<00:03:15.090> at<00:03:15.359> least<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.409> have<00:03:17.129> you<00:03:17.159> looked<00:03:17.459> at

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
stages but at least I have you looked at

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.509 
stages but at least I have you looked at
the<00:03:17.729> evidence<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.419> I<00:03:19.199> have<00:03:19.590> seen<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.489> I

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the evidence and I have seen what I

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.500 
the evidence and I have seen what I
think<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.840> most<00:03:22.049> conclusive<00:03:22.979> but<00:03:23.639> it<00:03:24.359> is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
think is the most conclusive but it is

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.199 
think is the most conclusive but it is
important<00:03:25.229> see<00:03:25.440> try<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.099> use<00:03:26.310> evidence<00:03:26.970> if

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
important see try and use evidence if

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.479 
important see try and use evidence if
you<00:03:27.359> do<00:03:27.540> try<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.109> make<00:03:28.379> up<00:03:28.590> arguments<00:03:29.220> against

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
you do try and make up arguments against

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.819 
you do try and make up arguments against
something<00:03:29.760> oh<00:03:30.060> wise<00:03:30.720> people<00:03:31.079> will<00:03:31.409> just<00:03:31.620> make

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
something oh wise people will just make

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.860 
something oh wise people will just make
fun<00:03:32.129> of<00:03:32.189> you<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.209> have<00:03:33.479> a<00:03:33.510> lack<00:03:33.840> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
fun of you because you have a lack of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.890 
fun of you because you have a lack of
evidence<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:35.370> woman<00:03:35.879> actually<00:03:36.090> argue

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
evidence this woman actually argue

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.110 
evidence this woman actually argue
saying<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.560> dinosaurs<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.699> only<00:03:38.939> been

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
saying that dinosaurs have only been

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.050 
saying that dinosaurs have only been
around<00:03:39.389> for<00:03:39.569> about<00:03:39.720> 200<00:03:40.590> years<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.250> how<00:03:41.669> could

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
around for about 200 years so how could

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.719 
around for about 200 years so how could
they<00:03:42.239> possibly<00:03:42.569> have<00:03:43.349> not<00:03:43.919> been<00:03:44.159> found<00:03:44.489> before

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
they possibly have not been found before

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.509 
they possibly have not been found before
that<00:03:45.209> well<00:03:45.599> actually<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.349> believe<00:03:47.040> they<00:03:47.280> have

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
that well actually I believe they have

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.819 
that well actually I believe they have
now<00:03:47.699> this<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.060> my<00:03:48.479> personal<00:03:49.169> opinion<00:03:49.290> and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
now this is just my personal opinion and

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.039 
now this is just my personal opinion and
there's<00:03:49.979> very<00:03:50.220> little<00:03:50.430> evidence<00:03:50.699> to<00:03:51.209> support

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
there's very little evidence to support

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.699 
there's very little evidence to support
it<00:03:52.409> but<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.310> think<00:03:53.849> people<00:03:54.659> with<00:03:55.169> finding

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
it but I think people with finding

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.879 
it but I think people with finding
dinosaur<00:03:56.430> bones<00:03:56.900> many<00:03:57.900> hundreds<00:03:58.530> are<00:03:58.680> maybe

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
dinosaur bones many hundreds are maybe

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.270 
dinosaur bones many hundreds are maybe
even<00:03:59.129> thousands<00:03:59.849> of<00:04:00.030> years<00:04:00.359> ago<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.169> I<00:04:01.650> think

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
even thousands of years ago and I think

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.170 
even thousands of years ago and I think
that<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.449> do<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.900> give<00:04:04.290> people<00:04:04.919> enough<00:04:05.609> credit

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
that we do not give people enough credit

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.030 
that we do not give people enough credit
to<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.810> were<00:04:07.019> alive<00:04:07.500> around<00:04:08.430> them<00:04:08.699> because<00:04:09.329> I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
to you were alive around them because I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.460 
to you were alive around them because I
think<00:04:11.040> these<00:04:11.280> people<00:04:11.579> knew<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.540> these<00:04:13.139> veins

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
think these people knew that these veins

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.430 
think these people knew that these veins
came<00:04:13.799> from<00:04:14.040> reptilian<00:04:14.669> animals<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.479> so<00:04:15.930> from

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
came from reptilian animals and so from

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.920 
came from reptilian animals and so from
that<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:17.099> were<00:04:17.459> getting<00:04:17.909> these<00:04:18.060> mips<00:04:18.599> of

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
that we were getting these mips of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.519 
that we were getting these mips of
dragons<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.070> other<00:04:20.329> mythical<00:04:21.329> creatures<00:04:21.900> so

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
dragons and other mythical creatures so

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:23.300 
dragons and other mythical creatures so
in<00:04:22.830> my

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
in my

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.340 
in my
personal<00:04:23.790> opinion<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.020> is

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
personal opinion I think that that is

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.440 
personal opinion I think that that is
probably<00:04:26.010> what<00:04:26.340> happened<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.150> word

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
probably what happened but the word

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.530 
probably what happened but the word
dinosaur<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.470> only<00:04:28.710> made<00:04:29.040> about<00:04:29.310> 200<00:04:30.300> years

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
dinosaur is only made about 200 years

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.140 
dinosaur is only made about 200 years
ago<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.710> i<00:04:31.740> hope<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.310> like<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.730> i<00:04:32.790> hope<00:04:33.030> you
