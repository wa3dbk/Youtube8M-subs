um as far as my working sets go i did um
three<00:03:00.200> plates<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:01.010> think<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> rep<00:03:02.150> range<00:03:02.480> was

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
three plates I think the rep range was

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.660 
three plates I think the rep range was
between<00:03:03.019> eight<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.440> ten<00:03:03.860> reps<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.310> my<00:03:04.430> first

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
between eight and ten reps for my first

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.849 
between eight and ten reps for my first
two<00:03:04.910> sets<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.359> then<00:03:05.480> my<00:03:05.600> my<00:03:05.989> last<00:03:06.230> two<00:03:06.440> sets<00:03:06.709> I

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
two sets and then my my last two sets I

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.849 
two sets and then my my last two sets I
didn't<00:03:07.130> do<00:03:07.220> equivalent<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.060> four<00:03:08.660> plates<00:03:09.049> for

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
didn't do equivalent of four plates for

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.979 
didn't do equivalent of four plates for
about<00:03:10.069> six<00:03:10.489> reps<00:03:10.790> for<00:03:11.000> those<00:03:11.150> last<00:03:11.450> two<00:03:11.660> sets

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
about six reps for those last two sets

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.660 
about six reps for those last two sets
so<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.410> don't<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.829> whole<00:03:12.980> bunch<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.250> 45

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
so I don't have a whole bunch of 45

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.819 
so I don't have a whole bunch of 45
place<00:03:13.970> laying<00:03:14.239> around<00:03:14.569> so<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.680> could<00:03:15.769> just

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
place laying around so if you could just

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.199 
place laying around so if you could just
look<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.280> bar<00:03:16.489> got<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:16.790> those<00:03:16.940> different

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
look at the bar got all those different

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.030 
look at the bar got all those different
place<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.630> got<00:03:17.780> some<00:03:17.959> 35<00:03:18.410> mixed<00:03:18.799> with<00:03:18.920> some

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
place I got some 35 mixed with some

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.039 
place I got some 35 mixed with some
tends<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.519> add<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.030> waste<00:03:20.239> though<00:03:20.480> that's

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
tends to add up to waste though that's

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.780 
tends to add up to waste though that's
what<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.260> did<00:03:21.530> four<00:03:21.829> sets<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:22.489> i<00:03:22.519> win

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
I've been doing this so i did about two

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.520 
I've been doing this so i did about two
sets<00:03:39.889> of<00:03:40.069> those<00:03:40.340> wide<00:03:40.670> grip<00:03:41.120> ones<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.440> i

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
sets of those wide grip ones and then i

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.349 
sets of those wide grip ones and then i
went<00:03:42.709> here<00:03:42.889> and<00:03:43.069> get<00:03:43.220> some<00:03:43.250> under<00:03:43.730> grip<00:03:44.060> wide

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
went here and get some under grip wide

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.930 
went here and get some under grip wide
grip<00:03:44.780> pull<00:03:44.810> ups<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.370> actually<00:03:46.579> hits

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
grip pull ups and this actually hits

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.599 
grip pull ups and this actually hits
your<00:03:47.120> lats<00:03:47.329> real<00:03:47.660> good<00:03:47.959> as<00:03:48.170> well<00:03:48.410> um<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.430> can

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
your lats real good as well um I can

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.599 
your lats real good as well um I can
actually<00:03:49.970> feel<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:51.260> doing<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.010> way<00:03:52.190> my

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
actually feel this doing it this way my

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.059 
actually feel this doing it this way my
lats<00:03:52.880> better<00:03:53.239> than<00:03:53.690> having<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.170> overhand<00:03:54.650> grip

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
lats better than having a overhand grip

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.920 
lats better than having a overhand grip
so<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.579> underhand<00:03:55.940> grip<00:03:56.060> really<00:03:56.450> does<00:03:56.660> hit

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
so the underhand grip really does hit

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.710 
so the underhand grip really does hit
those<00:03:57.109> last<00:03:57.470> pretty<00:03:57.769> damn<00:03:57.980> good

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720
