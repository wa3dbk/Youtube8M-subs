00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.430

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.020
 Nice to meet you, it is Higaki use 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.070
 What you need to be successful is what you need to be really successful 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:59.339
 What kind of training should I have 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.339
 I think that I want you to listen to it firmly 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:15.720
 Please to Come from the sure-handed legs dribble 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 There is a dream practice that alternates left and right in common practice, but this does not make much sense 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 Because 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:28.070
 This is because I have not stepped right or left at all 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:33.500
 If you look at the players who took the world's top players bound ball 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:37.100
 We are playing a dominant foot game Be sure to have a dominant foot game Here we receive a ball 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 I have to remember to dribble to be like that 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:47.250
 You will be to use alternately left and right and right-to-left is can even anyone but Kana month 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.610
 The ability foot fire is because can not be absolutely to be loaded with training 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.800
 Therefore please remember this dribble firmly 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:01.630
 I bet that one of the arguments foot out of the turn of the dribbling Why handed foot 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.350
 Use the sole of the foot when the ball leaves the front leg 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.849
 Or it should not be Naku' was switched at okay 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:14.410
 A player whose ball is not off the foot can turn out. 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:18.849
 The ball is not so clear that you can turn out 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.620
 I can make an out turn because I am not separated from my dominant foot sticking to my foot 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.220
 So what must be aware of the out of turn 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.860
 Do not leave the ball from the dominant foot can Sarn in out 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.670
