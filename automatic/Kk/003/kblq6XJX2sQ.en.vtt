00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
believe that every training has its

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
believe that every training has its
merest<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.729> best<00:01:18.000> results<00:01:18.659> i<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.930> received

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
training which is four days a week and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
training which is four days a week and
training<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.930> set<00:01:25.259> beyond<00:01:25.560> failure<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
training one set beyond failure now you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
training one set beyond failure now you
do<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:26.850> upsets<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.049> still<00:01:28.259> doing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
do do work upsets so you're still doing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that one set beyond failure I've always

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010

always um really enjoyed that kind of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
always um really enjoyed that kind of
training<00:01:36.750> maybe<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:37.950> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

fast because I get kind of bored with
multiple<00:01:41.549> sets<00:01:41.850> maybe<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> case<00:01:42.869> now

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

the<00:02:14.510> answer<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.840> yes<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.470> no<00:02:15.980> matter<00:02:16.130> what<00:02:16.490> you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
the answer is yes so no matter what you

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.490 
the answer is yes so no matter what you
do<00:02:16.820> you're<00:02:17.000> always<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.930> multiple

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
do you're always going to get multiple

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.340 
do you're always going to get multiple
times<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.490> week<00:02:19.730> hitting<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.720> same<00:02:20.930> muscle

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
times a week hitting the same muscle

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.560 
times a week hitting the same muscle
group<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.830> example<00:02:22.030> when<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.210> squats

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
group for example when you do squats

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.790 
group for example when you do squats
you're<00:02:23.780> supporting<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.350> with<00:02:24.380> everything

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
you're supporting it with everything

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
you're supporting it with everything
else<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.340> frequency<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.000> going<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.330> there

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
else the frequency is going to be there

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.690 
else the frequency is going to be there
so<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.690> do<00:02:26.780> believe<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.290> bro<00:02:27.500> split<00:02:27.920> training

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
so I do believe the bro split training

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.460 
so I do believe the bro split training
each<00:02:28.820> body<00:02:29.060> part<00:02:29.360> once<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.840> week<00:02:30.020> you're<00:02:30.200> still

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
each body part once a week you're still

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.410 
each body part once a week you're still
hitting<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.860> other<00:02:31.010> body<00:02:31.250> parts<00:02:31.580> when<00:02:32.330> you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
hitting the other body parts when you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.800 
hitting the other body parts when you
train<00:02:32.660> chest<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.260> hit<00:02:33.470> your<00:02:33.590> front<00:02:33.860> delts

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
train chest you hit your front delts

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.940 
train chest you hit your front delts
okay<00:02:35.810> that's<00:02:36.080> one<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> those<00:02:36.470> things<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
okay that's one of those things that I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.220 
okay that's one of those things that I
think<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.670> misconstrued<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
think is kind of misconstrued and I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.390 
think is kind of misconstrued and I
think<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.560> lot<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.770> these<00:02:39.950> armchair

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
think a lot of these armchair

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.830 
think a lot of these armchair
quarterbacks<00:02:40.940> really<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> hard<00:02:43.490> time

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
quarterbacks really have a hard time

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.810 
quarterbacks really have a hard time

deciphering the fact that they just um

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.270 
deciphering the fact that they just um
you<00:02:47.540> know<00:02:47.660> they<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.290> they<00:02:48.440> feel<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.920> unless

every<00:03:31.040> training<00:03:31.400> program<00:03:31.970> works<00:03:32.709> until<00:03:33.709> it

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
every training program works until it

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.280

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
think about it every training program

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.770 
think about it every training program
works<00:03:43.950> until<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.010> doesn't<00:03:45.390> when<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.510> stops

see<00:04:00.400> how<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.579> works<00:04:00.730> for<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.150> do<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.959> because
