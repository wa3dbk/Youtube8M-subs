00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
bit about why that can be fairly costly

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.130 
bit about why that can be fairly costly
to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> high<00:00:23.550> luster<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.029> aluminum<00:00:25.760> the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
to get a high luster on aluminum the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.030 
to get a high luster on aluminum the
aluminum<00:00:28.140> parts<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> XKE<00:00:29.099> engine<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.849> the

carburetors<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.430> folks<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.090> polish

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
carburetors and folks do like to polish

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.350 
carburetors and folks do like to polish
those<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> high<00:00:40.440> luster<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.180> be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
those to a high luster and it can be

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.100 
those to a high luster and it can be
done<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.809> let's<00:00:43.020> look<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> steps<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
done but let's look at the steps the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.069 
done but let's look at the steps the
aluminum<00:00:46.110> parts<00:00:46.410> were<00:00:46.950> originally<00:00:47.370> cast<00:00:47.610> as

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
aluminum parts were originally cast as

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.880 
aluminum parts were originally cast as
molten<00:00:49.079> aluminum<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:49.770> sand<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.899> rough

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
molten aluminum into sand and a rough

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
molten aluminum into sand and a rough
sand<00:00:53.340> casting<00:00:53.820> itself<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.600> rough<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sand casting itself is pretty rough and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.360 
sand casting itself is pretty rough and
it<00:00:55.170> certainly<00:00:55.410> doesn't<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> shiny

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it certainly doesn't have a shiny

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
it certainly doesn't have a shiny
appearance<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.170> back<00:00:58.350> side<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.070> you

appearance this is the back side and you
can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> casting<00:01:00.480> features<00:01:01.399> on

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
can see some of the casting features on

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780 
can see some of the casting features on
the<00:01:02.760> front<00:01:02.789> side<00:01:03.949> we<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.159> show<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the front side we will show what it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
the front side we will show what it
takes<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> fairly<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:06.780> polish<00:01:07.229> on

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
takes to get a fairly good polish on

Morey and he had a bead blasted now bead
blasting<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> process<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
blasting is a process that we do in a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
blasting is a process that we do in a
sandblast<00:01:20.100> cabinet<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.150> glass<00:01:21.479> beads

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
sandblast cabinet but we use glass beads

sandblast cabinet but we use glass beads
they're<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.799> uniform<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
they're a little more uniform and they

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
they're a little more uniform and they
give<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> better<00:01:24.600> appearance<00:01:25.610> bead

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
give you a better appearance bead

blasting walnut shells soda all those

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.390 
blasting walnut shells soda all those
processes<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.079> cleaning<00:01:31.740> parts<00:01:32.189> up

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
processes are good for cleaning parts up

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300 
processes are good for cleaning parts up
but<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.030> give<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.540> shine

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
but they will not give you a good shine

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.200 
but they will not give you a good shine
this<00:01:35.310> end<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> bead<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.360> bead<00:01:37.020> blasted<00:01:37.939> now<00:01:38.939> for

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this end is bead as bead blasted now for

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
this end is bead as bead blasted now for
the<00:01:39.299> rest<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.840> part<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:41.490> go<00:01:41.670> through

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the rest of the part will go through

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
the rest of the part will go through
putting<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.079> polish<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
putting a polish on it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429 
putting a polish on it
now<00:01:44.340> aluminum<00:01:44.820> doesn't<00:01:45.030> corrode<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
now aluminum doesn't corrode what it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
now aluminum doesn't corrode what it
does<00:01:46.649> some<00:01:47.070> react<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> air<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
does some react with the air and it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.590 
does some react with the air and it
oxidizes<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.399> oxidation<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> face

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
oxidizes and the oxidation on the face

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
oxidizes and the oxidation on the face
of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.869> aluminum<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:53.040> give<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> gray

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
of the aluminum will give it a gray

sanded<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.619> gradually<00:01:59.189> finer<00:02:00.149> grits<00:02:00.509> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
sanded it with gradually finer grits of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.200 
sanded it with gradually finer grits of
