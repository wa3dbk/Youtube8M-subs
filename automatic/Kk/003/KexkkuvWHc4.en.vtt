00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.500
 so hello together today there was still 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.690
 a new video because of the numerous 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.980
 ask questions like that with the internet 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.420
 Watching TV works like that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.200
 apparently hires a lot of problems 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.180
 to have with 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.560
 I like to admit I have too 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.420
 also mentioned in the comments 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.820
 scheduled at least two days and there 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.130
 really to look through there are so many 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.540
 contradictory websites at the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.860
 you do not always end up around that 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.230
 works as it is written 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.149
 That's why I'll just say it again briefly 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.010
 how does the lists work? 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.239
 said that you have to give yourself 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.589
 Just get out and I have too 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.129
 different lists or really these 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.980
 entire internet addresses are stored 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.149
 for the whole tv station comes say 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.379
 I once a month before that 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.429
 maybe one or two are not so 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.589
 you have to work again 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.010
 Google where there is a new list 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.989
 with the transmit data and otherwise that is 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.149
 really impeccable from the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.589
 Image quality from the reception he received from the 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.879
 speed how fast the center 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.019
 I 'll just load it 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:09.130
 just here and now here one 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.930
 list downloaded 3 open format 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.170
 easy with very normal editor of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.479
 Windows recognizes this this state are 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.770
 then the individual points 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.140
 I think that is in the end 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.810
 actually a separate list here now 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.039
 with atw and tv is namely the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.930
 Turkish sender and anyway something 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.850
 This is always the first one 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.820
 line is actually the name of the station 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.539
 which is displayed and the second line 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.710
 this is then always the stream itself 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.840
 yes that will go as I said or 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.509
 just running down there and at the end 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 save and then I'm got it 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.750
 Just called tour for that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.820
 Turkish TV and with that you can 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.140
 adjust in cody or xbmc what you can 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.119
 used I have here now 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 coli also installed on my mine 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.759
 pc you can do it of course with 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 an android box or the android tablet 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.140
 smartphone is not a problem 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 just times 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.950
 it looks like it starts too 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.750
 quickly there is an equal 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.590
 error message but you can 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.959
 to ignore 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.269
 these are just extra packages 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.590
 you can lose those you can confidently 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:22.580
 the green yes nothing to do with the live tv 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.580
 just like the television looks like 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 the double click on it is like that 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.920
 said on the android box is nothing 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.200
 other than that you probably 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.710
 to serve a foreigner family 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:41.030
 is the sender list the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.030
 Switching times are really great 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.680
 it really works from time to time 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.959
 better if the you the list 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.510
 list just google how 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.860
 said on the first three pages of mine 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.970
 opinion of the google results 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.840
 you can find it then just once 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.160
 for turk internet tv for example 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.330
 can examine one comes forward to the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.610
 corresponding pages and load themselves 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.989
 then this list down suits this 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.989
 and then it's actually so good 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.500
 As you can see the senders load inside 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.880
 from seconds 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.780
 I have many here too 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.220
 senders go 99 percent of 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.480
 That really worked 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.140
 no problem the same applies to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.430
 German tv stations actually in the reason 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.299
 from all because the only has to stop just 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.850
 just search here at all 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.170
 click on 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.670
 it can as you can see that there is a 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.160
 takes a bit longer with some 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.720
 transmitters that you really this this 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.980
 the typical regional station is simple 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.100
 hardly looked at 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.350
 they just do not have the bandwidth 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.160
 So these normal senders 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.910
 probably also many people look 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.230
 I have that now I actually go 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.730
 that will also automatically on the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.030
 Android box for example on 16 to 9 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.310
 you also really need dsl 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.200
 6000 completely out of it because nothing needs 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.720
 special and even ask are 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.019
 should be asked should write 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.289
 Just leave me and then leave 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.350
 comment and I I'll always easy 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.979
 one to two days to then up to 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.979
 next video
