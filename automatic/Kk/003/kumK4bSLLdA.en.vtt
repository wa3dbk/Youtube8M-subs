00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.749
 now but what is this I did not have 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.870
 thought that more than anything because I have 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:12.910
 panic to the cameras is that it is to see a 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.099
 camera there and that I'm studying the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.880
 audiovisual communication is focusing 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.680
 I do not see I do not like this plane because 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.890
 I do this basically because I want 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.930
 carry out a challenge that is to reach 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.030
 paint with my mother I think I like it 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.370
 that can not be achieved so I've 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.460
 proposed to paint like her in two years 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:37.269
 even if it can be to overcome the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.190
 ilusa for this I created this blog 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.579
 and so somehow forced me to have 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 to be uploading videos continuously 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.649
 and so I do not leave it because it usually happens 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.629
 let me start one thing and the flyers my 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.350
 mother right now makes pictures like 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 these I have here 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 x 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.090
 my mother has been painting 11 years watercolor 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 and throughout all these years what 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.430
 I have gotten it is then to get more or less 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.300
 at that level 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.610
 which is I'm going to try to do myself 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 try to overcome my mother in just 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.230
 two years what is my level the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.820
 will you be asking maybe recently 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.320
 that starting to go as a teacher of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.070
 watercolor to see I'm learning 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 still 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.280
 this is a nude 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.290
 so you know that the female body 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.870
 It is much more beautiful to paint than 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.790
 male body in these videos I'm going to 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.430
 speak then from how is a 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.260
 picture 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.840
 the composition of a painting how to paint 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.460
 for example a sky in watercolor that 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 it's what I 'm best at the moment 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.080
 and I know as I go 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.330
 learning and saying good up here 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.090
 today's video I hope that you have us 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.370
 boring a lot because this is a video 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.930
 simply to explain a little what 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.880
 I will do for example in the next 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.780
 Need to paint a watercolor
