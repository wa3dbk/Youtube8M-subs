my thought maybe I was and then I ended

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.770 
my thought maybe I was and then I ended
up<00:01:24.490> realizing<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:25.970> wasn't<00:01:26.240> wind<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
up realizing that I wasn't wind it and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.880 
up realizing that I wasn't wind it and
then<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.170> start<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.500> be<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.590> little<00:01:27.650> bit

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
then I start to be a little bit

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.850 
then I start to be a little bit
concerned<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:29.110> can't<00:01:30.110> move<00:01:30.229> my<00:01:30.409> arms<00:01:30.740> and

then into an ambulance anything so what

then into an ambulance anything so what
you<00:02:17.340> know<00:02:17.459> fracturing<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.030> seat<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:18.840> high

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you know fracturing your seat to so high

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.010 
you know fracturing your seat to so high
up<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.220> know<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.459> right<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.870> stem<00:02:21.870> of

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
up you know it's right at the stem of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.199 
up you know it's right at the stem of
your<00:02:22.320> there's<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.190> brain<00:02:23.520> stem<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.970> believe

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
your there's the brain stem I believe

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.890 
your there's the brain stem I believe
play<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> biggest<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.900> know

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
play the biggest of that out that know

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.690 
play the biggest of that out that know
the<00:02:28.170> percentages<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.010> were<00:02:29.220> given<00:02:29.459> are<00:02:29.550> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the percentages that were given are so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.320 
the percentages that were given are so
small<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.270> survive<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.470> then<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:33.030> small

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
small to survive that and then the small

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.750 
small to survive that and then the small
percentage<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.170> end<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.560> surviving<00:02:34.920> high

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
percentage that do end up surviving high

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.229 
percentage that do end up surviving high
impact<00:02:36.270> c2<00:02:37.020> fracture<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:38.520> paralyzed

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
impact c2 fracture are then paralyzed

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.060 
impact c2 fracture are then paralyzed
and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:42.320> there's<00:02:43.320> such<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> small<00:02:43.830> percentage

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
and then there's such a small percentage

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.009 
and then there's such a small percentage
of<00:02:44.250> people<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.580> are<00:02:44.730> not<00:02:44.880> from<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.750> group

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
of people that are not from that group

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.570 
of people that are not from that group
that<00:02:46.260> are<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.500> paralyzed<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> are<00:02:47.340> even

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
that are not paralyzed that are even

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.210 
that are not paralyzed that are even
able<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.330> operated<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:50.010> from

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
able to be operated on and then from

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.449 
able to be operated on and then from
that<00:02:50.250> small<00:02:50.730> percentage<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.100> there's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
that small percentage you know there's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.680 
that small percentage you know there's
there's<00:02:53.910> those<00:02:54.090> ones<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.660> a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
there's those ones that have a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.560 
there's those ones that have a
successful<00:02:55.350> operation<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.390> from<00:02:57.390> what<00:02:57.540> I

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
successful operation so from what I

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.970 
successful operation so from what I
understand<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> only<00:02:58.320> reason<00:02:58.890> that<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.860> know

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
understand the only reason that you know

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.289 
understand the only reason that you know
the<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.430> way<00:03:02.519> they<00:03:02.670> explain<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.269> a

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
the the way they explain it's like a

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.120 
the the way they explain it's like a
cigar<00:03:03.690> cutter<00:03:03.720> your<00:03:04.200> two<00:03:04.380> vertebrae's<00:03:04.890> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
cigar cutter your two vertebrae's and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
cigar cutter your two vertebrae's and
the<00:03:05.190> only<00:03:05.310> reason<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.790> didn't<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.420> go<00:03:07.260> across

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the only reason it didn't just go across

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.479 
the only reason it didn't just go across
was<00:03:07.830> because<00:03:08.209> when<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.390> been<00:03:09.660> fractured<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
was because when it's been fractured a

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.050 
was because when it's been fractured a
ship<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:14.220> know<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.580> happened

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
ship actually you know and this happened

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.870 
ship actually you know and this happened
so<00:03:15.209> fast<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.840> chip<00:03:16.170> up<00:03:16.320> vertebra<00:03:17.130> Qingdao

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
so fast but a chip up vertebra Qingdao

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.030 
so fast but a chip up vertebra Qingdao
enhanced<00:03:18.540> was<00:03:19.350> stuck<00:03:19.739> between<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:22.040> vertebra

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
enhanced was stuck between the vertebra

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.890 
enhanced was stuck between the vertebra
of<00:03:23.070> c2<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.239> allowing<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.840> go<00:03:25.049> across

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
of c2 and not allowing it to go across

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.580 
of c2 and not allowing it to go across
so<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:27.930> would<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.440> reason<00:03:28.799> that

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so that would be the reason that

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.740 
so that would be the reason that
another<00:03:31.590> situation<00:03:32.270> you<00:03:33.270> know<00:03:33.390> would<00:03:33.630> be<00:03:33.660> like

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
another situation you know would be like

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.670 
another situation you know would be like
winning<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.200> Powerball<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.790> he<00:03:36.090> said<00:03:36.680> it'd

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
winning the Powerball and he said it'd

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.910 
winning the Powerball and he said it'd
be<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.130> win<00:03:38.340> pothole<00:03:38.849> twice<00:03:39.530> that's<00:03:40.530> that's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
be like win pothole twice that's that's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.470 
be like win pothole twice that's that's
the<00:03:41.099> situation<00:03:41.640> you're<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.090> he<00:03:42.180> said<00:03:42.390> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
the situation you're in so he said it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.680 
the situation you're in so he said it
goes<00:03:42.599> far<00:03:42.870> beyond<00:03:43.200> luck<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.010> I'm<00:03:44.640> not<00:03:45.480> right

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
goes far beyond luck and I'm not right

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.199 
goes far beyond luck and I'm not right
there<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.319> know<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.030> so

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
there you know you know it's just so

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.410 
there you know you know it's just so
emotional<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.720> hear<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:51.090> know<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
emotional to hear that you you know the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.830 
emotional to hear that you you know the
the<00:03:52.319> odds<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:54.330> know<00:03:54.420> not

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
the odds that you you know not

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.820 
the odds that you you know not
necessarily<00:03:54.959> beaten<00:03:55.800> but<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:57.830> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
necessarily beaten but just that just it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.559 
necessarily beaten but just that just it
could<00:03:59.010> have<00:03:59.130> gone<00:03:59.280> such<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.580> different<00:04:00.000> way<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
could have gone such a different way and

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.650 
could have gone such a different way and
the<00:04:01.200> such<00:04:02.010> little<00:04:02.400> percentage<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.420> you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
the such little percentage that that you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.830 
the such little percentage that that you
have<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.170> close<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:06.209> that's<00:04:06.600> why

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
have to close this way is is that's why

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.730 
have to close this way is is that's why
they<00:04:07.019> say<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.470> say<00:04:07.739> it's<00:04:07.920> far<00:04:08.100> more<00:04:08.160> than<00:04:08.370> luck
