00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
basics keep that in mind now I want to

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.600 
basics keep that in mind now I want to
take<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> time<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.799> show<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.129> some<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.519> the

take the time to show you some of the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.190 
take the time to show you some of the
functions<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.360> learned<00:02:37.720> on<00:02:37.959> this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
functions that I learned on this

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500 
functions that I learned on this
keyboard<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.190> first<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> select<00:02:40.269> clip

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
keyboard the first one is a select clip

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.910 
keyboard the first one is a select clip
toggle<00:02:41.110> which<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.319> pretty<00:02:41.620> straightforward

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
toggle which is pretty straightforward

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.240 
toggle which is pretty straightforward
the<00:02:42.879> next<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.930> enable/disable<00:02:44.650> clip

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the next one is the enable/disable clip

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.280 
the next one is the enable/disable clip
toggle<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.360> last<00:02:46.599> one<00:02:46.780> which<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.049> found

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
toggle and the last one which I found

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.770 
toggle and the last one which I found
the<00:02:47.440> most<00:02:47.590> useful<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.700> snapping<00:02:49.299> toggle

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the most useful is the snapping toggle

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.900 
the most useful is the snapping toggle
which<00:02:50.230> essentially<00:02:50.769> turns<00:02:51.099> on<00:02:51.280> magnetization

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
which essentially turns on magnetization

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.150 
which essentially turns on magnetization
to<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.540> clips<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.140> turns<00:02:53.349> off<00:02:53.620> magnetization

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
to the clips and turns off magnetization

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.190 
to the clips and turns off magnetization
to<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.670> clips<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.239> also<00:02:55.450> wanted<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> show<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
to the clips I also wanted to show you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.259 
to the clips I also wanted to show you

to cut at really fast and it's

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
to cut at really fast and it's
definitely<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:40.030> really<00:03:40.569> useful<00:03:40.720> tool<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.590> also

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
definitely a really useful tool I also

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.539 
definitely a really useful tool I also
never<00:03:42.700> knew<00:03:42.940> about<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.599> JKL<00:03:44.079> Keys

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549

never knew about this the JKL Keys
backwards<00:03:45.549> stop<00:03:45.849> forward<00:03:46.359> this<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.079> just<00:03:47.260> way

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
backwards stop forward this is just way

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.309 
backwards stop forward this is just way
better<00:03:47.650> than<00:03:47.829> having<00:03:48.099> to<00:03:48.609> use<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:49.599> mouse<00:03:49.959> to

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
better than having to use the mouse to

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.020 
better than having to use the mouse to
go<00:03:50.530> back<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.889> wherever<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.250> want<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.489> go<00:03:51.549> and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
go back to wherever you want to go and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.059 
go back to wherever you want to go and
it's<00:03:52.660> just<00:03:52.840> annoying<00:03:53.200> having<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.889> but

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
it's just annoying having to do that but

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.430 
it's just annoying having to do that but
it's<00:03:54.250> better<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.579> have<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:54.790> JKL<00:03:55.150> keys<00:03:55.569> also<00:03:56.200> a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
it's better to have the JKL keys also a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's better to have the JKL keys also a
key<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:56.889> I<00:03:56.950> already<00:03:57.190> knew<00:03:57.340> about<00:03:57.459> was<00:03:57.730> the
