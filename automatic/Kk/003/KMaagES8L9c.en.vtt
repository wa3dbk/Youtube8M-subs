00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.740
 Look, the black vi came back with another one. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.119
 video for you this wonderful night 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 where we can see our arena 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.939
 mainly the west faÃ§ade with this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.939
 illuminated glass 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.149
 perhaps in reality the transparent part 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.149
 of lights 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 Afternoon building is to come to that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.910
 Score 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:53.130
 And now we're filming for you. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.130
 some more of this facade 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.870
 that soon when everything is 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.219
 illuminated 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.290
 then we will have the dimension of how 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.470
 will stay the moment 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.330
 not close to you guys over there 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.830
 working on the asphalt part of the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.870
 parking 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.870
 we can see workers 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.640
 Ball show even from the 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.640
 input 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.010
 really cool 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.780
 and this picture really we have this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.320
 point here today was making a video 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 I found a person who accompanies the fan 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.500
 page of the prosecutor of the faithful was very happy 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.360

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.440
 and let's find out who he is, his name is 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.300
 wesley pereira and then you okay maybe 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.369
 around here but making a video is 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.390
 liking what you're seeing there because the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.740
 Dude, let's face it, it was done. 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.960
 you do not live here in the area 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.360
 East and also, right? 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.460
 ours produced advertising presence 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.310
 we were talking for now 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.340
 little and started to stay the night did not 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.640
 we resist and we end up seeing how the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.640
 Lighting is still incredible I thought 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.870
 Cool show, now just wait. 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.270

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 Thank you to participate in the video, is this it? 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.380
 people this is the public's affection 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.360
 people come to our arena is to 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.450
 later a cioso to know what 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.690
 is happening here and this image 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.690
 that we have 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.550
 now we're just closing the video of that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.710
 Saturday night 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.420
 during that wonderful night it looks 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.650
 profile practically our facade 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:20.420
 illuminated through the reflection of the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.700
 lights are lit on the inside of the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.710
 building 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.810
 better than that, just being everything 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.810
 illuminated even looks how beautiful 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.270
 here we can also see the part of the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.550
 And so I'm going to approach 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.320
 we can a little light part of the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:48.360
 coverage is almost 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:55.820
 hours now but what matters is that the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.820
 pictures are really wonderful 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.240
 thereafter 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.920
 the coverage is clear that to make video 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.920
 during the night is more difficult because 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.620
 there is no natural daylight and the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.510
 pictures stay a little longer 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.300
 compromised but we can already visualize 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:26.560
 very well our arena links to scene 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.590
 more or less there for you from 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.800
 the staircase and a little closer 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.669
 try to get at the detail for you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.669
 reflection 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750
 sensational 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.920
 at a stretch 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.140
 well at least that was the video and we have 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.580
 For you, because more than 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.580
 magic a hug, all good 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.410
 only the last video for you is clear 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.720
 that everything is dark here near the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.090
 odebrecht entry but at least 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.870
 we can see I do not know if you will see the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:15.180
 the images clear but at night 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.890
 here near the entrance of odebrecht 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.890
 the image stays this way 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.039
 a short video closing 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.980
 this Saturday, March 29, 2014 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.040
 This is it, everyone, a hug and everything. 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.040
