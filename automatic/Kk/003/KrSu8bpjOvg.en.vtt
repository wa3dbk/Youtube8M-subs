00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.920
 sailors and youtube friends pleased me 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.960
 that you follow a new road to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.300
 battle field before you turned on 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.370
 Today I want to talk about the recoil 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 Control while firing the weapons 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.040
 speak 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.559
 many probably already have it 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.870
 a big drawback belongs to ours 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.040
 battlefield 3 had been plagued with now 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.440
 Battlefield 4 fixed 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.960
 and here is the talk of the often 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.820
 hated to rush effect so the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.500
 fact that they are by opposing 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.750
 fire in your sight ability in 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.550
 battlefield 3 was extremely limited 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.530
 the whole thing would be so in battlefield 4 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.380
 handled that only heavy caliber 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 as lms and sniper rifles one 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.770
 create suppression effect and this 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.720
 even at a greater distance 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.520
 will show appropriate effect 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.140
 Now you ask yourself what this 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.930
 suppression effect with the recall 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.850
 control of the weapons has to do 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.259
 well, by the fact that you are yours 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.610
 Opponents are not that easy anymore 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.530
 suppression can move more freely 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.420
 be exactly placed shots yet 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.160
 more important and plays the recall 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.479
 control plays a key role 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.759
 I will explain this to you now 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.710
 an example illustrate this 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.330
 You can test the whole thing yourself 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.429
 best of all, preferably one as possible 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.649
 colored wall and fire expensive pages 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.720
 On it you should have one 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.450
 Countermeasure of the mouse avoid around 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 to get an accurate picture 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.050
 then you see the course on the wall 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.850
 the actual connections and can for 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.170
 the future accordingly with one 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 directional adjustment of the mouse 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 counter and thus the field of action 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.490
 adjust more precisely 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.770
 in the case of here as used 994 means 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.630
 that he light the mouse by the fire 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 moves down to the recall 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.979
 compensate accordingly 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.869
 As you can see, this is focused on 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.360
 fire on a suitably smaller one 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 radius, making it more accurate for 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.170
 does that mean that you are in multiplayer 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 your opponents because of not 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.430
 Regression recoil it not easy 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.470
 fired over the head and thus 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.420
 pull the shorter but yours 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.700
 resist the necessary ball pack 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.540
 missed her accordingly 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.340
 to strike down that I thereby the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 shot goes by the different 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.110
 weapons I will show you 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.310
 the both hated and loved one 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.040
 m16 a3 in this case warp the balls 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.750
 slightly to the top right 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.160
 should give the whole counter 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.380
 Therefore, look for them in the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.670
 opposite direction speaks up 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.670
 move down left 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.700
 In principle, it should be noted 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.140
 be that almost all weapons over 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.970
 several different shot modes 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.780
 and this depending on the situation 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.739
 can also be used meaningfully 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.420
 Fire brigade, for example, for a long time 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.400
 Distance offers itself to the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.620
 Appropriate weapon on lake me fire too 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.299
 ask for accurate shots due to the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.959
 to be able to place a lower recoil 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.430
 and also ammunition to save 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.019
 but also the burst mode so that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.269
 Firing of ointments with mostly three 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.500
 shot offers both on medium and 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.079
 also another distance one 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.610
 corresponding benefits so if they 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.560
 I have not done it yet 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.329
 really just guess that shot picture 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.220
 to analyze your weapon and 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.560
 to try out appropriate measures 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.910
 just what the mouse is going to be 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.010
 I'll see you in an upcoming video 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.510
 give important information by one 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.890
 further advantage on the virtual 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.079
 procure a battlefield 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.120
 if you want more information 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.799
 Battlefield 4 seeks then looks up 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.870
 have not done it anyway 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.209
 times when only over there gets 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.069
 her competent and serious information too 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.879
 all themes around battlefield in 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.230
 this sense 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.230
 you always keep an eye on your goal
