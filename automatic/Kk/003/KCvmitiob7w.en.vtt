 Ghandi said: Whatever you do in life ... 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.671
 ... will be unimportant. 

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:08.993
 But it's very important that you do it. 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.988
 Officer, he was just trying to stop them. 

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.183
 Go home! 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.617
 - Hey, hey, hey! - Do not touch me! 

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.017
 I agree with the first part. 

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.980
 You could get worse if you didn't have a father to pay you out of prison. 

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.946
 I don't want to be paid off. 

00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:23.984

 Why do you think Dad doesn't want to spend time with me? 

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.138
 He knows I take care of her. 

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:30.655
 That's all, Tyler. 

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.675
 That is all. It's not enough. 

00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:34.528
 INFRINGED RULES 

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:36.930
 You know you can't smoke here, do you? 

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:39.008
 Why do you have an ashtray here? 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.028
 It's a bowl. 

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.163
 Complements the room. 

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:42.988
 I guess she was here just to teach me. 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.850
 He lost his way 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.811
 You've been like a ghost for the past few weeks. 

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:49.690
 You don't even go out. 

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:52.064
 I've got enough of these states, okay? 

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.495
 Why don't you get your bench here? 

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.090
 UP TO MOMENT - He has a daughter! 

00:00:57.506 --> 00:00:58.383
 Who has a daughter? 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.936
 The cop who arrested you and threw him down! 

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.066
 He has a daughter! 

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:02.634
 I know her. I'm in her class on Global Politics with her. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.506
 Follow her. 

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:06.567
 I don't dare sociological problems. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.788
 You're lucky I didn't make a decision. 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.932
 About what? 

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:11.279
 About everything. 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:12.964
 BEFORE SOMETHING SOMETHING 

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.098
 What desserts do you want? 

00:01:14.198 --> 00:01:15.197
 I'll have a dessert first. 

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:18.786
 What is it? 

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:20.553
 This is our starter. 

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:22.023
 That's why the cats are weird, man. 

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.155
 They love these crazy poetic shit. 

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:25.882
 Charles, this is your son. 

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:27.842
 Yeah, how about dinner? 

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.820
 - How many people? - Three. 

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:32.458
 He can't stand me, but he'll talk to you. 

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:35.779
 You won't take care of anything! 

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.235
 You're not responsible for anyone! You're a baby! 

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:39.743

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.032
 I go out. 

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:42.018
 With who are you going? 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.218
 School boy. 

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:44.856
 You're a little lost, aren't you? 

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.534
 Do you think you know me? No. 

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:50.473
 My dad doesn't know what's going on now. 

00:01:50.747 --> 00:01:51.833
 And what is happening now?

 Someone was trying to tell me something. 

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:13.485
 Have something forever. 

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.728
 And it never ends.
