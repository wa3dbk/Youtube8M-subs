 Well, that was all, it was clarified that for me, Argentina is a little stronger and 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.840
 He also had a little more experience due to the wars of the Malvinas and 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.400
 also visit the global page firepower dotcom and pan american 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.210
 argentina is ranked 32 in chile in 45 after all I hope that they 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.910
 I liked it very much if you want to subscribe it is verified I do not want comment 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.289
 offensive will be Argentines towards Chileans follow Chile news 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.979
 Argentinian would only accept if I will respond offensive comments because 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.069
 I'm not saying that Argentina is at its best or worse than Chile is only 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.129
 updated information may be that Argentina is a bit stronger nothing 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:50.279
 plus 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.499
 it is not to be offended chile because they have a good development greetings up 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.469
