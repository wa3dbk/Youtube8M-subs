00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.520 
free or sulfate free I think I did see
one<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> said<00:02:07.970> low<00:02:08.970> sulfate<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.200> still

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
one that said low sulfate but they still

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.500 
one that said low sulfate but they still
have<00:02:10.709> sulfates<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.700> so

have sulfates and it's so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.300
