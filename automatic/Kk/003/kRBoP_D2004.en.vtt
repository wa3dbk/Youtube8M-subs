00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.779 
three reclines so hands hold on the back
and<00:00:19.929> that's<00:00:20.560> how<00:00:20.710> flat<00:00:21.099> that<00:00:21.310> goes<00:00:21.550> so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
and that's how flat that goes so

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.579 
and that's how flat that goes so
initially<00:00:22.480> if<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:22.929> wanted<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.380> put<00:00:23.560> your

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
you have got three set positions that

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.450 
you have got three set positions that
you<00:01:01.359> can<00:01:01.390> adjust<00:01:01.659> that<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:02.980> if<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.159> do<00:01:03.280> want

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
you can if however you want to take the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.650 
you can if however you want to take the
whole<00:01:07.930> thing<00:01:07.960> off<00:01:08.290> it's<00:01:08.620> easily<00:01:08.980> done<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.450> also

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
whole thing off it's easily done it also

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.230 
whole thing off it's easily done it also
has<00:01:11.080> an<00:01:11.290> extra<00:01:11.620> safety<00:01:12.040> feature<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.640> that's

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
has an extra safety feature and that's

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.930 
has an extra safety feature and that's
this<00:01:13.450> part<00:01:13.810> here<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.370> reasoning<00:01:15.820> behind

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
this part here and the reasoning behind

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.660 
this part here and the reasoning behind
that<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.420> if<00:01:16.840> your<00:01:17.140> child<00:01:17.530> was<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.250> be<00:01:18.310> clever

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
that is if your child was to be clever

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.130 
that is if your child was to be clever
enough<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.090> be<00:01:19.180> able<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.420> wiggle<00:01:19.600> out<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.870> their

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
enough to be able to wiggle out of their

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.980 
enough to be able to wiggle out of their
five-point<00:01:20.650> fully<00:01:20.890> adjustable<00:01:21.310> harness<00:01:21.990> they

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
five-point fully adjustable harness they

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.560 
five-point fully adjustable harness they
can't<00:01:23.320> get<00:01:23.770> past<00:01:24.010> that<00:01:24.310> part<00:01:24.610> as<00:01:24.850> well<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
can't get past that part as well and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.870 
can't get past that part as well and
then<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.230> has<00:01:26.470> got<00:01:26.680> two<00:01:26.980> little<00:01:27.160> openings<00:01:27.670> on

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
then it has got two little openings on

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.850 
then it has got two little openings on
the<00:01:27.910> back<00:01:28.180> here<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.230> back<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.770> your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
the back here and on the back of your

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.270 
the back here and on the back of your
highchair<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:31.390> has<00:01:31.630> got<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.140> facility<00:01:32.800> for

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
highchair it has got the facility for

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.720 
highchair it has got the facility for
you<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.550> just<00:01:33.790> attach<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.450> onto<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> back

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
you to just attach that onto the back

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.700 
you to just attach that onto the back
now<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:36.880> tucks<00:01:37.240> away<00:01:37.540> nice<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.080> neatly<00:01:38.290> so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
now that tucks away nice and neatly so

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.280 
now that tucks away nice and neatly so
if<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:38.920> don't<00:01:39.130> want<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.460> use<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.820> tray<00:01:40.290> we
