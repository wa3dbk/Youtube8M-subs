00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
notice yet again um okay the whole idea

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.729 
notice yet again um okay the whole idea
of<00:00:37.950> taking<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.430> game<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.790> XCOM<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.379> mobile

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
of taking a game like XCOM to a mobile

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
of taking a game like XCOM to a mobile
device<00:00:40.770> kind<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.430> makes<00:00:41.610> sense<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.180> really

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
device kind of makes sense it really

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
device kind of makes sense it really
does<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.960> mean<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.680> saw<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> even<00:00:44.430> when

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
does I mean that we saw this even when

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
does I mean that we saw this even when
it<00:00:44.700> came<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.539> mean<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it came out like I mean it's just it's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
it came out like I mean it's just it's
turn-based<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.120> mean<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> control

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
turn-based right I mean the control

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
turn-based right I mean the control
scheme<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.129> easily<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.610> would

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
scheme you can see how easily it would

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.490 
scheme you can see how easily it would
translate<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> mobile<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> mean<00:00:52.320> when

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
translate to mobile right so I mean when

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040 
translate to mobile right so I mean when
they<00:00:52.590> announced<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.640> me<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.870> lot

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
they announced this I think me and a lot

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
they announced this I think me and a lot
of<00:00:55.079> other<00:00:55.289> people<00:00:55.620> were<00:00:55.829> super<00:00:56.250> excited<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of other people were super excited and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.860 
of other people were super excited and
edition<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> obvious<00:00:58.710> yeah<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
edition kind of obvious yeah right but

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.609 
edition kind of obvious yeah right but
we<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.140> major<00:01:01.469> franchises<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:03.270> over<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.170> two

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
we see major franchises go over to two

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
we see major franchises go over to two
mobile<00:01:04.890> devices<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.580> only<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.210> ever<00:01:06.360> seen<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
mobile devices I only have ever seen a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
mobile devices I only have ever seen a
game<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.409> replicates<00:01:08.130> itself<00:01:08.400> from<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
game that replicates itself from the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.750 
game that replicates itself from the
console<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> PC<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.040> device<00:01:11.310> how

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
console and the PC on the device how

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
console and the PC on the device how
does<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> transfer<00:01:12.840> work<00:01:13.020> yeah<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
does that transfer work yeah I was

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
does that transfer work yeah I was
trying<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.490> another<00:01:14.729> game<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> did

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
trying to think of another game that did

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
trying to think of another game that did
that<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.439> Bastion<00:01:17.250> comes<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> mind

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that and I Bastion comes to mind

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.200 
that and I Bastion comes to mind
Oh<00:01:18.210> Bastion<00:01:18.960> did<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> Bastion<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
Oh Bastion did that but on Bastion it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
Oh Bastion did that but on Bastion it
didn't<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.630> work<00:01:21.750> super<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.380> right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
didn't really work super well right

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.840 
didn't really work super well right
because<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> an<00:01:23.400> action<00:01:23.670> game

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
because it's kind of an action game

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.039 
because it's kind of an action game
right<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> mean<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> couple

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
right I mean there are a couple

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.010 
right I mean there are a couple
different<00:01:25.380> control<00:01:25.740> schemes<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.430> had

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
different control schemes that they had

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
different control schemes that they had
whereas<00:01:28.020> XCOM<00:01:28.619> fuels<00:01:29.030> supernatural<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
whereas XCOM fuels supernatural you can

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
whereas XCOM fuels supernatural you can
you<00:01:30.630> tap<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> bring<00:01:31.860> up<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> soldier

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you tap to kind of bring up a soldier

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
you tap to kind of bring up a soldier
and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> either<00:01:33.479> tap<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.869> confirm

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and then you can either tap and confirm

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.039 
and then you can either tap and confirm
or<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:34.950> saying<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.340> double<00:01:35.610> tap

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
or like I was saying you can double tap

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
or like I was saying you can double tap
everything<00:01:37.049> makes<00:01:37.380> perfect<00:01:37.860> sense<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
everything makes perfect sense with a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.090 
everything makes perfect sense with a
touch-based<00:01:38.670> interface<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.890> big

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
touch-based interface you know my big

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
touch-based interface you know my big
concern<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> game<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.150> XCOM<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
concern with the game like XCOM is that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
concern with the game like XCOM is that
you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.950> accidentally<00:01:44.460> click<00:01:44.700> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you know I would accidentally click in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
you know I would accidentally click in
the<00:01:44.909> space<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> didn't<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the space that I didn't want to and I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.780 
the space that I didn't want to and I
would<00:01:46.649> buy<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> space<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> obviously

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
would buy you two a space and obviously

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
would buy you two a space and obviously
yeah<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.689> disturbing<00:01:49.200> sure<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.530> stop

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
yeah it's disturbing sure you can stop

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
yeah it's disturbing sure you can stop
yourself<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.700> Excel<00:01:51.060> rest<00:01:51.240> rate

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
yourself you can start Excel rest rate

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
yourself you can start Excel rest rate
yeah<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.899> does<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.860> mean<00:01:53.250> there's<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
yeah it does and I mean there's a lot of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
yeah it does and I mean there's a lot of
instances<00:01:53.939> where<00:01:54.210> even<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
instances where even even with like a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.149 
instances where even even with like a
mouse<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> keyboard

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
mouse and keyboard

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
mouse and keyboard
I<00:01:56.280> accidentally<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> wrong<00:01:57.600> space<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I accidentally go to the wrong space and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.540 
I accidentally go to the wrong space and
then<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.680> entire<00:01:58.979> game<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.520> screwed

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
then my entire game is screwed

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.770 
then my entire game is screwed
so<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:01.850> know<00:02:01.940> I've<00:02:02.030> been<00:02:02.060> playing<00:02:02.480> for<00:02:02.600> about

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
so you know I've been playing for about

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.210 
so you know I've been playing for about
a<00:02:02.810> week<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.140> half<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:03.800> not<00:02:03.980> had<00:02:04.190> that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
a week and a half I have not had that

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.000 
a week and a half I have not had that
happen<00:02:04.640> once<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.380> makes<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.740> ton<00:02:06.980> of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
happen once I think it makes a ton of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.040 
happen once I think it makes a ton of
sense<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.670> played<00:02:07.850> mostly<00:02:08.180> on<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.450> iPad

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
sense I have played mostly on the iPad

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
sense I have played mostly on the iPad
we<00:02:09.560> should<00:02:09.710> note<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.580> universal<00:02:11.270> app

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
we should note that it's a universal app

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.110 
we should note that it's a universal app
so<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.230> one<00:02:12.560> purchase<00:02:12.830> $20<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.030> talk

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
so it's one purchase $20 so we can talk

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.030 
so it's one purchase $20 so we can talk
about<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.450> later<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.350> will<00:02:15.500> run<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.740> both

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
about that later and it will run on both

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.490 
about that later and it will run on both
your<00:02:16.220> phone<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.390> your<00:02:17.540> tablet<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.050> it's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
your phone and on your tablet and it's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100 
your phone and on your tablet and it's
got<00:02:18.710> iCloud<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.210> can<00:02:20.390> be<00:02:20.600> starting

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
got iCloud so that you can be starting

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.470 
got iCloud so that you can be starting
the<00:02:21.200> campaign<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:22.070> your<00:02:22.310> iPad<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.000> then<00:02:23.150> pick

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
the campaign on your iPad and then pick

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
the campaign on your iPad and then pick
it<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:23.960> phone<00:02:24.110> okay<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.160> idea<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
it up on your phone okay the idea and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.030 
it up on your phone okay the idea and
maybe<00:02:26.450> I'm<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:26.840> imposing<00:02:27.380> sort<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.620> my<00:02:27.710> sense

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
maybe I'm just imposing sort of my sense

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.530 
maybe I'm just imposing sort of my sense
of<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> want<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.940> phone<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.300> idea

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
of what I want to do on a phone the idea

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140 
of what I want to do on a phone the idea
of<00:02:29.600> playing<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.050> game<00:02:30.310> we're<00:02:31.310> having<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.940> get

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
of playing a game we're having to get

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790 
of playing a game we're having to get
sort<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> good<00:02:33.080> bird's-eye<00:02:33.410> view<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
sort of a good bird's-eye view of the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.290 
sort of a good bird's-eye view of the
battlefield<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.520> essential<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.000> mean<00:02:35.150> does<00:02:35.270> it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
battlefield so essential I mean does it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.840 
battlefield so essential I mean does it
really<00:02:35.600> work<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> phone<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.340> does<00:02:37.580> you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
really work on the phone it does you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.580 
really work on the phone it does you
know<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.000> think<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.960> real<00:02:39.110> estate<00:02:39.260> is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
know I think that the the real estate is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.140 
know I think that the the real estate is
a<00:02:39.620> little<00:02:39.890> bit<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.130> concern<00:02:40.460> things<00:02:40.910> feel<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
a little bit of a concern things feel a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300 
a little bit of a concern things feel a
little<00:02:41.390> more<00:02:41.570> cluttered<00:02:41.990> on<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.200> phone<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
little more cluttered on the phone the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.490 
little more cluttered on the phone the
interfaces<00:02:43.820> are<00:02:44.030> actually<00:02:44.510> they<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.290> some

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
interfaces are actually they have some

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.220 
interfaces are actually they have some
subtle<00:02:45.950> differences<00:02:46.190> on<00:02:46.820> iPad<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.720> base<00:02:47.900> view

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
subtle differences on iPad the base view

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
subtle differences on iPad the base view
has<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.830> room<00:02:49.070> names<00:02:49.370> at<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.670> top<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.120> you

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
has the room names at the top that you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.270 
has the room names at the top that you
can<00:02:50.240> navigate<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:51.440> on<00:02:51.590> console<00:02:52.100> and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
can navigate to just like on console and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.490 
can navigate to just like on console and
PC<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.330> iphone<00:02:53.930> those<00:02:54.140> buttons<00:02:54.410> would

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
PC but on iphone those buttons would

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.440 
PC but on iphone those buttons would
probably<00:02:54.830> be<00:02:55.040> too<00:02:55.220> small<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.940> instead<00:02:56.270> there's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
probably be too small so instead there's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.810 
probably be too small so instead there's
a<00:02:56.510> single<00:02:56.960> rooms<00:02:57.200> button<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:58.070> expands<00:02:58.550> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
a single rooms button that expands and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.340 
a single rooms button that expands and
allows<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.120> easy<00:02:59.150> access<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.990> any<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
allows you easy access to any of the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.710 
allows you easy access to any of the
major<00:03:00.500> rooms<00:03:00.860> within<00:03:01.160> your<00:03:01.430> base<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.480> mean

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
major rooms within your base but I mean

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.140 
major rooms within your base but I mean
you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.990> pinch<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.350> zoom<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:04.550> works<00:03:04.760> fine<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
you can pinch to zoom it works fine and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.130 
you can pinch to zoom it works fine and
what's<00:03:05.300> interesting<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.660> actually<00:03:05.989> I've<00:03:06.110> got

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
what's interesting is actually I've got

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.140 
what's interesting is actually I've got
an<00:03:06.470> iPhone<00:03:06.800> 5<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.400> I've<00:03:07.520> got<00:03:07.670> an<00:03:07.730> iPad<00:03:07.970> Mini

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.170 
an iPhone 5 and I've got an iPad Mini
the<00:03:08.450> game<00:03:09.020> looks<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.770> runs<00:03:10.190> better<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.850> my

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the game looks and runs better on my

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.630 
the game looks and runs better on my
iPhone<00:03:11.540> 5<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.320> does<00:03:12.500> on<00:03:12.800> my<00:03:13.100> iPad<00:03:13.459> Mini

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.760 
these I mean imagine the next version of
civilization<00:06:41.390> depend<00:06:41.720> on<00:06:41.810> what<00:06:42.350> engine<00:06:42.680> is

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
civilization depend on what engine is

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.950 
civilization depend on what engine is
can<00:06:42.950> be<00:06:43.040> built<00:06:43.250> on<00:06:43.430> yeah<00:06:44.240> imagine<00:06:44.510> that<00:06:44.690> coming

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
can be built on yeah imagine that coming

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.900 
can be built on yeah imagine that coming
out<00:06:45.110> simultaneously<00:06:45.920> because<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.700> interface

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
out simultaneously because the interface

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.820 
out simultaneously because the interface
works<00:06:47.270> the<00:06:47.540> controls<00:06:47.930> work<00:06:48.170> and<00:06:48.470> it<00:06:48.620> looks

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
works the controls work and it looks

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.610 
works the controls work and it looks
good<00:06:49.040> so<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:50.060> it<00:06:50.720> makes<00:06:50.960> sense<00:06:51.200> to<00:06:51.590> have

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
good so and it makes sense to have

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.920 
good so and it makes sense to have
turn-based<00:06:52.070> hum<00:06:52.790> oh<00:06:52.910> really<00:06:53.450> does<00:06:53.660> all<00:06:53.900> right

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
turn-based hum oh really does all right

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.930
