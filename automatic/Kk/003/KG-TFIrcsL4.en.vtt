00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
wanted to try to think of a way that we

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.940 
wanted to try to think of a way that we
can<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.090> people<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> stay<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
can get people to stay down now what I

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
can get people to stay down now what I
thought<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.820> broom<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.170> take

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
thought about is there a broom if I take

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
thought about is there a broom if I take
a<00:00:37.620> broom<00:00:37.860> nor<00:00:38.129> Denari<00:00:38.399> broom<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.629> know

a broom nor Denari broom I don't know
any<00:00:40.370> unordinary<00:00:41.370> brooms<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> anyway<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:44.129> I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
any unordinary brooms but anyway if I'm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.400

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.930 
going to brush or sweep in front of me
and<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.620> sweeping<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.340> stairs<00:00:50.640> here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and I'm sweeping these stairs here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
and I'm sweeping these stairs here
notice<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.199> back<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.710> sweep<00:00:53.070> low

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
notice that on the way back I sweep low

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.479 
notice that on the way back I sweep low
and<00:00:53.789> slow<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.289> through<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.860> sweep

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and slow and on the way through I sweep

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
and slow and on the way through I sweep
blowing<00:00:56.879> slow<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> brushing<00:00:58.980> motion

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
blowing slow so this brushing motion

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
blowing slow so this brushing motion
here<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.820> kind<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> nice<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> get

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here is kind of a nice little way to get

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340 
here is kind of a nice little way to get
into<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.680> golf<00:01:01.980> swing<00:01:02.510> low<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.780> low<00:01:04.049> through

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
into my golf swing low back low through

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.030 
into my golf swing low back low through
while<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.799> low<00:01:05.159> through<00:01:05.610> okay<00:01:06.770> what<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
while back low through okay what I see a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.320 
while back low through okay what I see a
lot<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> people<00:01:08.490> doing<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.970> something

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
lot of people doing would be something

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.130 
lot of people doing would be something
that<00:01:09.450> looks<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that looks like this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.539 
that looks like this
up<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:11.000> up<00:01:12.799> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.070> back

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
up up up on the way back

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.260 
up up up on the way back
blowing<00:01:15.060> slow<00:01:15.270> brush<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> club<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.850> on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
blowing slow brush the club on the on

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350 
blowing slow brush the club on the on
the<00:01:18.450> ground<00:01:19.310> after<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.580> hit<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> ball<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the ground after you hit the ball the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850 
the ground after you hit the ball the
club's<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.689> remain<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> ground<00:01:22.409> moving

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
club's gonna remain on the ground moving

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
club's gonna remain on the ground moving
toward<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.280> target<00:01:23.460> sweeping<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.659> your

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
toward your target sweeping to your

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
toward your target sweeping to your
target<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> nice<00:01:26.729> sweeping

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
target so we should have a nice sweeping

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.249 
target so we should have a nice sweeping
motion<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
motion so if I just start like this and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.580 
motion so if I just start like this and
make<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> sweeping<00:01:32.009> motion<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.549> forth

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
make a sweeping motion back and forth

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
make a sweeping motion back and forth
notice<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.070> also<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.579> my<00:01:35.729> body<00:01:36.000> turning

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
notice how I also get my body turning

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.640 
notice how I also get my body turning
here<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.020> doing<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.500> my

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here I'm not just doing this with my

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
here I'm not just doing this with my
arms<00:01:38.009> arms<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.030> inefficient<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.810> I'll

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
arms arms is very inefficient and I'll

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.160 
arms arms is very inefficient and I'll
get<00:01:40.439> tired<00:01:40.799> after<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.820> while<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> keep<00:01:43.020> my

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
get tired after a while if I keep my

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050 
get tired after a while if I keep my
arms<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:43.740> body<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.310> keep<00:01:44.610> turning

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
arms on my body and just keep turning

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.899 
arms on my body and just keep turning
back<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> forth<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.490> can<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> all

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
back and forth here I can do this all

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
back and forth here I can do this all
day<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.630> maybe<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.170> day<00:01:49.530> but

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
day this is well maybe not all day but

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
day this is well maybe not all day but
close<00:01:50.070> enough<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.290> efficient

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
close enough and this is very efficient

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.429 
close enough and this is very efficient
arms<00:01:53.399> working<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.970> my<00:01:54.180> body<00:01:54.409> now<00:01:55.409> let's

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
arms working with my body now let's
