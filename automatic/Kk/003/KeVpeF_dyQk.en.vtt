okay<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:17.390> didn't<00:01:18.390> miss<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.720> ripped<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.080> hair

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.600 
okay so I didn't miss I ripped my hair
for<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:22.970> 20<00:01:23.970> minutes<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> shampooed<00:01:26.460> at

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
for about 20 minutes and I shampooed at

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
for about 20 minutes and I shampooed at
once<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> clarifying<00:01:27.659> shampoo<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.440> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
once with the clarifying shampoo and I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
once with the clarifying shampoo and I
just<00:01:28.740> tried<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> rinse<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:30.180> where<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just tried to rinse it that's where the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
just tried to rinse it that's where the
water<00:01:30.600> ran<00:01:30.840> clear<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.440> it's<00:01:31.590> probably<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> good

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
water ran clear so it's probably a good

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
water ran clear so it's probably a good
idea<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:34.110> sink<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.500> something

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
idea to do this and a sink or something

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
idea to do this and a sink or something
where<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.520> water<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.840> rinse

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
where you can see the water and I rinse

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
where you can see the water and I rinse
my<00:01:37.440> hair<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:37.950> looked<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.580> water<00:01:38.790> was

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
my hair and it looked like the water was

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
my hair and it looked like the water was
running<00:01:39.360> clear<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> squeeze<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
running clear then I squeeze it out and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
running clear then I squeeze it out and
you<00:01:42.149> know<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.540> hand<00:01:42.899> underneath<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you know put my hand underneath it like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
you know put my hand underneath it like
this<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.149> water<00:01:45.330> was<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this and I could see the water was a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560 
this and I could see the water was a
little<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.990> cloudy<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.190> kept<00:01:48.149> rinsing

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
little bit cloudy so I kept rinsing

from the grocery store and it's okay I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
from the grocery store and it's okay I
like<00:02:51.359> it<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> doesn't<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.799> any

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
like it because it doesn't have any

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.330 
like it because it doesn't have any
marrow<00:02:53.370> oil<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:56.100> don't<00:02:56.280> like

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
marrow oil in it but I really don't like

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.920 
marrow oil in it but I really don't like
the<00:02:56.489> smell<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.970> doesn't<00:02:57.269> stink<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.750> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the smell it doesn't stink it's just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.680 
the smell it doesn't stink it's just
kind<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.859> too<00:02:58.920> fruity<00:02:59.340> then<00:03:00.239> what<00:03:00.660> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
kind of way too fruity then what I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410 
kind of way too fruity then what I
normally<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.500> usually<00:03:01.980> use<00:03:02.160> vitamin<00:03:03.030> E

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
oil but as you can see that's giving

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.220 
oil but as you can see that's giving
kind<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.820> low<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.390> mixed<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.790> some

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
notice that there's less residue like at

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.750 
notice that there's less residue like at
the<00:04:43.080> ends<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.590> my<00:04:43.620> loss<00:04:43.950> but<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.490> look<00:04:44.640> at

the ends of my loss but just look at
them<00:04:45.170> they<00:04:46.170> look<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.380> lot<00:04:46.590> cleaner<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.280> those

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
them they look a lot cleaner so those

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.120 
them they look a lot cleaner so those
are<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.640> things<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.810> like<00:04:49.320> about<00:04:49.560> this

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
are the things that I like about this

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.750

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.880 
rinse the things that I'm not not close
but<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.120> don't<00:04:54.300> feel<00:04:54.390> like<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:55.080> never<00:04:55.620> used

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
but I don't feel like I never used

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.680 
but I don't feel like I never used
clarifying<00:04:56.460> shampoo<00:04:56.820> before<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.390> I<00:04:57.420> don't

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
clarifying shampoo before so I don't

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.860 
clarifying shampoo before so I don't
know<00:04:57.810> how<00:04:58.560> much<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.920> this<00:04:59.070> was<00:04:59.280> because<00:04:59.910> I<00:05:00.540> use

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
know how much of this was because I use

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.870 
know how much of this was because I use
the<00:05:01.140> clarifying<00:05:01.560> shampoo<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.550> rinse<00:05:02.790> my

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
the clarifying shampoo and I rinse my

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.970 
the clarifying shampoo and I rinse my
hair<00:05:03.240> for<00:05:03.660> 20<00:05:04.650> minutes<00:05:04.950> yesterday<00:05:05.100> so<00:05:06.500> maybe<00:05:07.500> I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
hair for 20 minutes yesterday so maybe I

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.250 
hair for 20 minutes yesterday so maybe I
don't<00:05:08.100> know<00:05:08.340> if<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:09.300> all<00:05:09.780> these<00:05:10.020> things

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
don't know if it's all these things

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.810 
don't know if it's all these things
combined<00:05:10.650> are<00:05:10.680> just<00:05:11.130> one<00:05:11.340> of<00:05:11.460> them<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:11.700> that's

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
combined are just one of them so that's

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.000 
combined are just one of them so that's
one<00:05:12.090> thing<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:13.230> I'm<00:05:13.380> not<00:05:13.410> sure<00:05:13.740> if<00:05:13.860> it's

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
one thing that I'm not sure if it's

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.730 
one thing that I'm not sure if it's
apple<00:05:14.370> cider<00:05:14.490> vinegar<00:05:15.110> with<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.230> baking<00:05:16.560> soda

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
apple cider vinegar with the baking soda

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.520 
apple cider vinegar with the baking soda
formerly<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:18.150> do<00:05:18.480> wash<00:05:18.930> my<00:05:19.140> hair<00:05:19.350> with

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
formerly I just do wash my hair with

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.610 
formerly I just do wash my hair with
baking<00:05:20.040> soda<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:21.630> water<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.200> then<00:05:22.320> I'll<00:05:22.440> use

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
baking soda and water and then I'll use

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.680 
baking soda and water and then I'll use
a<00:05:22.650> little<00:05:22.920> bit<00:05:22.980> of<00:05:23.040> shampoo<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.600> I

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
a little bit of shampoo so and I

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.510 
a little bit of shampoo so and I
normally<00:05:24.870> don't<00:05:25.110> rinse<00:05:25.440> my<00:05:25.650> hair<00:05:25.919> for<00:05:26.370> that

long

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
long

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.059 
long
I<00:05:27.039> think<00:05:27.430> maybe<00:05:28.270> if<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.199> start<00:05:29.469> renting<00:05:29.650> my<00:05:29.860> hair

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
I think maybe if I start renting my hair

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.010 
I think maybe if I start renting my hair
longer<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.729> might<00:05:31.029> see<00:05:31.389> some<00:05:31.659> of<00:05:31.779> the<00:05:31.839> same

the<00:06:03.610> baking<00:06:03.939> soda<00:06:04.089> is<00:06:04.300> really<00:06:04.599> harsh<00:06:04.870> on<00:06:05.139> your

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.350 
the baking soda is really harsh on your
hair<00:06:05.469> so<00:06:05.499> I<00:06:06.249> don't<00:06:07.089> know<00:06:08.849> maybe<00:06:09.849> with<00:06:10.180> the

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
apple cider vinegar it just might be a

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:13.709 
apple cider vinegar it just might be a
little<00:06:12.430> harsh<00:06:12.639> so<00:06:12.939> that's<00:06:13.240> that's<00:06:13.389> the<00:06:13.569> only
