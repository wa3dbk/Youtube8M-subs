to stress the ins the muscles deep

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.500 
to stress the ins the muscles deep
inside<00:00:38.590> so<00:00:39.130> it<00:00:39.219> gets<00:00:39.430> its<00:00:39.610> normal<00:00:40.000> length<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
inside so it gets its normal length and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.780 
inside so it gets its normal length and
it<00:00:40.840> take<00:00:40.960> pressure<00:00:41.290> off<00:00:41.469> your<00:00:41.710> discs<00:00:41.980> allow

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
the discs top sort moisture so that this

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.160 
the discs top sort moisture so that this
can<00:00:45.640> expand<00:00:46.239> because<00:00:46.600> they<00:00:46.780> create<00:00:47.079> this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
can expand because they create this

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.350 
can expand because they create this
vacuum<00:00:47.500> inside<00:00:48.070> your<00:00:48.219> discs<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.610> because<00:00:49.329> of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
vacuum inside your discs and because of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.540 
vacuum inside your discs and because of
that<00:00:49.570> your<00:00:50.110> nerve<00:00:50.350> will<00:00:50.590> not<00:00:50.800> be<00:00:50.950> pinched<00:00:51.309> and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
that your nerve will not be pinched and

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.240 
that your nerve will not be pinched and
then<00:00:52.270> you<00:00:52.360> have<00:00:52.480> less<00:00:52.629> pain<00:00:52.989> okay<00:00:53.680> so<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.129> is

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
then you have less pain okay so this is

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.490
