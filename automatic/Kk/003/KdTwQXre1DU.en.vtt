00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
computer and it's basically aimed at

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.870 
computer and it's basically aimed at
children<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.189> learn<00:00:08.309> how<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.460> computer

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
children to learn how to computer

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.759 
children to learn how to computer
program<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.599> actual<00:00:09.900> box<00:00:10.110> old<00:00:10.500> wires

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
program the actual box old wires

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.930 
program the actual box old wires
attached<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.660> has<00:00:12.660> no<00:00:13.410> cover<00:00:13.830> good<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.670> that

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
attached to has no cover good way that

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
attached to has no cover good way that
if<00:00:15.089> you're<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.870> techie<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> really

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
if you're a really techie and you really

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.310 
if you're a really techie and you really
like<00:00:16.830> computers<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.300> yes<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
like computers you think yes this is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.189 
like computers you think yes this is
good<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.189> what's<00:00:20.369> inside<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
good I can see what's inside the if you

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.450 
good I can see what's inside the if you
haven't<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.560> might<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> bit<00:00:26.099> freaked<00:00:26.310> out

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
haven't you might be a bit freaked out

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.370 
haven't you might be a bit freaked out
about<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.359> hooked<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.840> LEDs<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
about it when we hooked up some LEDs to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
about it when we hooked up some LEDs to
these<00:00:28.500> pins<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.519> wrote<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> few<00:00:29.970> lines<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
these pins and we wrote a few lines of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
these pins and we wrote a few lines of
program<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.230> told<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> LED<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> turn<00:00:32.189> on

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
program and it told the LED to turn on

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.979 
program and it told the LED to turn on
then<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.180> wrote<00:00:33.300> another<00:00:33.480> couple<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.840> lines

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
then they wrote another couple of lines

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
then they wrote another couple of lines
until<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> LED<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.739> turn<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.430> could

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
until the LED to turn off so they could

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.520 
until the LED to turn off so they could
understand<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.600> typed<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.290> code

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
understand when they typed in some code

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
understand when they typed in some code
there<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.460> something<00:00:38.670> actually

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
there was actually something actually

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
there was actually something actually
cuted<00:00:39.300> behind<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> task

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
cuted behind it so there was like a task

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
cuted behind it so there was like a task
performance<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> computer<00:00:44.850> could<00:00:44.969> actually

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
performance the computer could actually

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540 
performance the computer could actually
understand<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.140> were<00:00:46.260> writing<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.219> if

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
understand what you were writing and if

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
understand what you were writing and if
so<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.000> typed<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> special<00:00:48.840> computer

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so if you typed in a special computer

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
so if you typed in a special computer
language<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.950> I'd<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
language like I'd like to go off if you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.100 
language like I'd like to go off if you
typed<00:00:51.870> entry<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> girl<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.930> was

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
typed entry and a girl off so it was

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
typed entry and a girl off so it was
very<00:00:55.350> clever<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.610> funny<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.329> them

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
very clever it was funny to see how them

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
very clever it was funny to see how them
get<00:00:58.140> themselves<00:00:58.500> around<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> keyboard<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
get themselves around the keyboard I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
get themselves around the keyboard I
mean<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.579> kids<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.879> like<00:00:59.969> seven<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> nine

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mean these kids are like seven to nine

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
mean these kids are like seven to nine
years<00:01:00.570> old<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.680> liked<00:01:01.890> about<00:01:02.039> 4oz

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
years old good thing I liked about 4oz

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.840 
years old good thing I liked about 4oz
berry<00:01:02.789> pie<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.559> typing<00:01:05.070> part<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
berry pie was the typing part because I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
berry pie was the typing part because I
really<00:01:06.240> liked<00:01:06.390> typing<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> type<00:01:07.619> quite

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
really liked typing I can type quite

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190 
really liked typing I can type quite
quick<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.700> fun<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> do

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
otherwise you can have to start over

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
otherwise you can have to start over
again<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.159> needed<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> over<00:01:15.900> 20<00:01:16.380> times<00:01:16.970> we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
again I needed to do it over 20 times we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
again I needed to do it over 20 times we
kept<00:01:18.270> getting<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.750> wrong<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.310> was

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
kept getting it wrong but it was it was

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
kept getting it wrong but it was it was
right<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> kept<00:01:21.210> saying<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.720> wrong<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
right but it kept saying it was wrong so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
right but it kept saying it was wrong so
we<00:01:22.650> had<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> redo<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> five<00:01:24.030> times<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> was

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
we had to redo it five times and it was

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
we had to redo it five times and it was
really<00:01:25.049> annoying<00:01:25.380> we've<00:01:26.040> shown<00:01:26.280> today<00:01:26.460> with

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
really annoying we've shown today with

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.039 
really annoying we've shown today with
seven<00:01:27.060> year<00:01:27.180> olds<00:01:27.390> seven<00:01:27.659> year<00:01:27.750> olds<00:01:27.900> can

seven year olds seven year olds can

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.830 
seven year olds seven year olds can
learn<00:01:28.200> programming<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.780> even<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
learn programming you know and even I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
learn programming you know and even I
think<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.200> five<00:01:31.439> five<00:01:31.860> year<00:01:32.070> olds<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> learn

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
think from five five year olds can learn

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
think from five five year olds can learn
what<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.030> algorithm<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> set<00:01:34.259> of

instructions<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> learn<00:01:42.270> about

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
instructions they can learn about

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.749 
instructions they can learn about
algorithms<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> fact<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.670> there

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
algorithms I like the fact that there

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
algorithms I like the fact that there
was<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.180> techie<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.259> could

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
was it it was quite techie and you could

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
was it it was quite techie and you could
see<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.920> inside<00:01:50.189> bits<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> get

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
see all the inside bits and kind of get

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
see all the inside bits and kind of get
to<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.220> was

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to know them well the good thing was

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.990 
to know them well the good thing was
that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:55.229> typing<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> words<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that I like typing all the words and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
that I like typing all the words and
letters<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> looking<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> actual

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
letters and looking at the actual

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
letters and looking at the actual
Raspberry<00:01:59.369> Pi<00:01:59.960> finding<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.380> could

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
Raspberry Pi finding out what it could

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.280 
Raspberry Pi finding out what it could
do<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.130> thing<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.939> didn't<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
do the thing I didn't like was the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.880 
do the thing I didn't like was the
computers<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.640> freaky<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:07.590> wouldn't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
computers going freaky and it wouldn't

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
computers going freaky and it wouldn't
work<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.940> knowing<00:02:09.660> where<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
work all the time just knowing where to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
work all the time just knowing where to
go<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> find<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.709> how<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> do

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
go to find out how to do

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.010 
go to find out how to do
and<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.630> today<00:02:12.780> was

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and that's one of the things today was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.700 
and that's one of the things today was
all<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:14.450> showing<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.870> anyone<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.350> do<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
all about showing that anyone can do it

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.020 
all about showing that anyone can do it
so<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:16.980> seven-year-olds<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> can

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so if seven-year-olds can do it you can

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.610 
so if seven-year-olds can do it you can
do<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.390> anyone<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:19.430> enjoy<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.470> make

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
do it anyone can enjoy that do it make

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.640 
do it anyone can enjoy that do it make
sense<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.810> you're<00:02:24.810> saying<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.470> don't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
sense if you're saying is if we don't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.260 
sense if you're saying is if we don't
get<00:02:25.830> children<00:02:26.130> excited<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.700> technology<00:02:26.880> at

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
get children excited about technology at

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.150 
get children excited about technology at
this<00:02:27.360> early<00:02:27.630> age<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.680> skills<00:02:29.040> going

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
this early age that these skills going

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.500 
this early age that these skills going
to<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.340> forgotten<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.000> won't<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.450> any

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
to get forgotten and we won't have any

really<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.200> all<00:02:37.260> about<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.980> little

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
really what it's all about this little
