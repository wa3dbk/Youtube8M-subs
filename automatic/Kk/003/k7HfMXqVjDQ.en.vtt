00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello girls today we are here on the axis and 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.480
 we are in particular with ana isabel 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.520
 Brunette who is responsible manager 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.650
 responsible household appliances of the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.870
 signature lg and we have come because we wanted 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.970
 watch live and live 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.200
 this hard wait that is the home robot already 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.060
 you know we have made a comparison 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
 of vacuum cleaners and this is one of those that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.230
 we liked it more because it is very 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.480
 silent but let's see is going to 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.610
 tell what is special about this 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.250
 vacuum cleaner that has special 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 they are as many things as we would say 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.690
 to us what we like to say is that 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 It is best cleaned market 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.850
 cleans in a very clever way the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.190
 axis has by policy is pending 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.290
 the details and with these bites 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.170
 it seems that we have achieved it because 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.660
 we say it cleans better because 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.070
 has a double camera that normally 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.960
 rest of vacuum cleaners in the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.269
 market do not have them and he just one 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.729
 has only one this has double camera 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.310
 one of them that is down here and another 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.500
 of them is this that is here that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 focuses on the ceiling that makes this camera what 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.940
 what it does is read on the roof of the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.550
 rooms and makes a map does 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.170
 photographs and makes a map of the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.090
 room with which it cleans of a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.310
 much more efficiently as 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 calculate the route you have to do 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.800
 they invest less time because they calculate it 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.860
 Y 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.440
 he runs out of material or has cleaned 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 go back to your site and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.570
 what advantages does this format have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.440
 inspiring in front of one of these tube 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.420
 hand we say and also what 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.430
 we repeat that it is totally different 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 This vacuum cleaner does not replace the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 conventional respirator that all 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 know 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.760
 the conventional stones like the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.770
 Clean combat combat is 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.780
 Cleaning once a month or each 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 fifteen 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.380
 in which you have to neither see in 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.899
 sofa depth 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.610
 carpets flames this vacuum cleaner what 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.890
 does is keep the house clean area 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.050
 this expired substitute let's say it's 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.780
 Broom replaces the 21st century 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.940
 brush grip every day if they have 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.080
 pets that comes great clean the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.580
 hairs of the cats 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.030
 Awesome 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 then it also has something we've seen 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.180
 that you have taught us that inside 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.700
 the cassette and is only way 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.830
 take it out because it goes like nasa and then 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.470
 open effectively there is a difference 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.150
 respect to the competition and is that the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 competition usually has the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.530
 deposit down here then at the time 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.570
 to clean it or take out the deposit to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.510
 clean what you do what you have aspired 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.730
 you take it out and it goes open and normally 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.650
 what you have just aspired to is returned to 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.960
 soil that makes what about this that is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.060
 an advantage that seems to be pending 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.440
 of the details seems silly but 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.440
 it's very important and we have it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.030
 up here we take it out is as easy as 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.800
 do so 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.020
 you take it out, you base it or you just do 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.990
 well and it's already empty 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.690
 it does not come out 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.670
 dirt that has taken out 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.520
 another thing that has caught our attention 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.020
 in the person 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.880
 for itself and here it's more complicated to 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.790
 disarm but it's very easy put it here 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.610
 in one of the brushes is a rag 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.590
 mustang you usually put it on me 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.959
 back and makes two in one clean two in 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.390
 one cleans the dust and then 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.430
 opening several after brushes for what 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.290
 are these brushes are to get to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.110
 the corners in an easy way because 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.010
 as you know how you see is a product 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 Round is very cool design and you will say 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.180
 jolin how the corners arrive by 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.250
 get with these brushes is worth 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.530
 we are left clean corners 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.450
 totally clean for refills there is no 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.150
 no problem there is no problem 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.900
 the only problem and it's not a problem of 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.120
 case of lg is an advantage is the battery 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.090
 the battery this type of vacuum cleaners 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.190
 carries lithium battery 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.750
 we let this lead to the mobiles 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.750
 indeed you know 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.230
 has other lithium battery the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.840
 competition has a nickel material 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.030
 the difference is that agriculture in 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.940
 much less hours the lithium lasts you 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.150
 more and buying a new battery that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.919
 usually cost between 80 and 100 euros 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.040
 of lithium usually hurt usually lasts as 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.810
 two years 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.080
 nine thousand human beings is finished 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.080
 just 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.020
 we liked it a lot, it has four 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.570
 functions four functions of cleaned 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.210
 and depending on how the room is or 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.569
 as you want to clean the most useful 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.969
 let's say it's the spot function 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.219
 spot means that you tell the 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.929
 appliance where you have to clean and the 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.929
 device only signals with the command 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.069
 you point them to the command 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.169
 vacuum cleaner that goes the place where 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.180
 You want to clean and vacuum cleaner 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.620
 gird only your space and you are 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.700
 circling in that space until 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.010
 you consider 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.410
 and to finish what color is this 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.990
 available we have right now five 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.170
 colors we have in wood if we see the 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.170
 red there is one green one blue and one gray 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.750
 very good and price prices are 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.750
 Between 449 590 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.510
 thank you very much what we are going 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.640
 to do now girls we are going to leave 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.900
 the vacuum placed on the table for 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.900
 that you see that it does not fall
