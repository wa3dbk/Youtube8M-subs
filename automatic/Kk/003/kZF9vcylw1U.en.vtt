00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 That's a feeling full of thinking that can really be used in various situations this time, but this is 5 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:16.830
 It How does there is that Tteyuu was written in the image of the kind of reader Once you have a person 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:20.260
 Oh in Oh Well Well basically Naa very happy if you can bet a wide range of Ano Pick that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.770
 While in the Well of the earlier that you thought 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.880
 I'm not talking about it 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:35.830
 It is said that the situation of getting lost is so huge 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:40.250
 I stole and I think of some place that it is easy to publish because after choices have a lot of 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 When I talk about something, I will talk about the set meal of the set restaurant but the color 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:50.059
 Retention without diner's menu of only three people to go to eat your lunch, for example, 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.700
 I think that I don't regret choosing anything out of three 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.290
 What would you choose if there were 50 instead of 3 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.040
 But even though the stuff I've eaten is delicious , I guess I wanted more food to eat 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.870
 No Kaaaaa 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.080
 Because I think a lot Toka or more of the other Choi place is not it amount than here there were many with 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.320
 It is because it is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.690
 That so do not just each one law choose be obtained no matter how much knowledge and information and experience 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.110
 Because 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:22.660
 After all tomorrow is very easy to release that ãƒ¼ 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.250
 Always attracted not there Naa's only a set meal when Toka of such has entered the era is so whether the era is now fifty wards 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.750
 Only a lot of choices 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 I can not choose one, I say that such a frustrating state still continues 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.710
 Because there is a place 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.640
 But at that time I still like my own taste 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:45.619
 Well Toka what you want to do this well high-rise effective policy of big fan I direction of something like the Toka 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 I 'm glad I didn't really have a choice, but if I have one I will choose 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:53.470
 Out it never has been past especially the post-very 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.760
 There is a point that it becomes pessimistic about things that have not yet been optimistic 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.710
 So I wonder if would you say something for him left a little at its strange because there 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:07.750
 Say there is that kind of thing in such state Well, feel free to me to say how is I'm weird 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.530
 I know it is amazing the example of good Naa and I thought to do would Do rotor dinner Once divided was first 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.840
 It is cheap 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.910
 Still 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 There is a lot of really great from there, so it seems to be particularly young people in the dining room here right now 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 I think so 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.660
 Then when I said what kind of job to choose or what kind of way to choose from now on 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.160
 It's ok, but where can we go to become a Shogi lord? 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.830
 Why is the wave ring 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.980
 It will be very difficult if you look carefully 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.100
 I do so because even there I frequently Market 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 4 If I was a child, I knew that I was able to challenge from the beginning I did not know that I entered it 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.130
 I think that in a certain departure 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.819
 Then it's amazing because I'm investigating now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.810
 The case that you are troubled if you can not challenge you or you are hesitant 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:59.260
 In I think many Now it is sometimes like that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:04.660
 Such a variety of copper or something as a very good methodology of the I mean to say that Once you have 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.670
 It is important that it is important for people who came to talk and tell 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.670
 I do not think the seal
