consoles<00:02:40.050> we're<00:02:40.320> going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> blow<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.040> out<00:02:41.280> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
consoles we're going to blow that out of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
consoles we're going to blow that out of
the<00:02:41.520> water<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.360> players<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.080> now<00:02:43.320> that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the water what players can do now that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.110 
the water what players can do now that
the<00:02:43.650> memory<00:02:43.980> footprint<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> those<00:02:44.610> systems<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the memory footprint of those systems is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
the memory footprint of those systems is
so<00:02:45.300> much<00:02:45.510> larger<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:46.260> creates<00:02:46.560> web<00:02:46.770> boxes

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so much larger just creates web boxes

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.890 
so much larger just creates web boxes
that<00:02:47.370> are<00:02:47.400> anywhere<00:02:48.060> from<00:02:48.120> eight<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> ten

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that are anywhere from eight to ten

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.560 
that are anywhere from eight to ten
times<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.440> size<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.520> truly<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.239> going<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
times the size so you truly are going to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
times the size so you truly are going to
be<00:02:51.690> able<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.050> use<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:52.290> imagination<00:02:52.530> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
skill tree so what you guys are seeing

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.650 
skill tree so what you guys are seeing
right<00:03:22.560> now<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:23.010> actually<00:03:23.670> iron<00:03:24.000> man's<00:03:24.330> skill

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
tree each character has 40 different

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.390 
tree each character has 40 different
moves<00:03:27.720> inside<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.140> their<00:03:28.260> skill<00:03:28.500> tree<00:03:28.709> and

based on your maximum level about 30 of

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.170 
based on your maximum level about 30 of
those<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.739> unlocked<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.640> idea<00:03:32.940> being

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
those can be unlocked the idea being

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.789 
those can be unlocked the idea being
that<00:03:33.360> your<00:03:33.750> iron<00:03:33.989> man<00:03:34.290> you're<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> level

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
that your iron man you're going to level

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.440 
that your iron man you're going to level
up<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> be<00:03:35.250> different<00:03:35.549> than<00:03:35.760> than<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.239> my

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
up to be different than than the my

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.720 
up to be different than than the my
character<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.890> applies<00:03:38.190> not<00:03:38.220> only<00:03:38.459> for

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
character so this applies not only for

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.400 
character so this applies not only for
all<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.239> new<00:03:39.360> Marvel<00:03:39.690> characters<00:03:40.080> but<00:03:40.260> also

all the new Disney characters and we
even<00:03:42.600> have<00:03:42.750> skill<00:03:43.200> trees<00:03:43.500> for<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
even have skill trees for all of the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.550 
even have skill trees for all of the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
thinking there is that we want to keep

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.539 
thinking there is that we want to keep
all<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.930> older<00:03:49.290> Disney<00:03:49.650> characters<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.340> on

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
vanellope relevant so as we evolve the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.199 
vanellope relevant so as we evolve the
platform<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:55.980> evolve<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.489> different

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
platform and we evolve the different

platform and we evolve the different
types<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.510> gameplay<00:03:57.900> systems<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.590> put

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
types of gameplay systems that we put

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.710 
types of gameplay systems that we put
into<00:03:58.920> infinity<00:03:59.519> we<00:03:59.910> want<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.180> make<00:04:00.330> sure<00:04:00.360> that

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
into infinity we want to make sure that

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.330 
into infinity we want to make sure that
all<00:04:00.930> those<00:04:01.110> older<00:04:01.470> characters<00:04:01.890> still<00:04:02.160> stay

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
all those older characters still stay
