well we wanted tonnage deliver a similar
experience<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.920> mean<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.340> know<00:00:26.400> crackdown

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
experience I mean it you know crackdown

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.849 
experience I mean it you know crackdown
is<00:00:27.060> unique<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> try<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
is unique and and so we want to try and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099 
is unique and and so we want to try and
retain<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.429> specialness<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.300> but

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
retain all that specialness about it but

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.080 
retain all that specialness about it but
we<00:00:31.199> also<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> expand<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
we also want to expand on the way of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510 
we also want to expand on the way of
doing<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> potential<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
doing that the potential for so you know

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
doing that the potential for so you know
we're<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.210> cranking<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> numbers<00:00:36.960> in

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
we're really cranking up the numbers in

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're really cranking up the numbers in
terms<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> player<00:00:38.250> fights<00:00:38.489> against

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
terms of what the player fights against

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
terms of what the player fights against
you<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.750> well<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you know as well as what they can do so

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
you know as well as what they can do so
for<00:00:41.850> example<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.910> mechanic<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
for example you know the mechanic of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
for example you know the mechanic of
freaks<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.170> fighting<00:00:46.920> against<00:00:47.070> thousands<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
freaks and fighting against thousands of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.049 
freaks and fighting against thousands of
people<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.899> population<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.370> great<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
people in a population just is great and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
people in a population just is great and
then<00:00:51.180> you've<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> elements<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
then you've also got the elements of the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.950 
then you've also got the elements of the
freeform<00:00:53.219> game<00:00:53.460> play<00:00:53.730> crackdown<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.690> really
