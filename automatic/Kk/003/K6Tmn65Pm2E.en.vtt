00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
possible and the top 4 or top five right

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
possible and the top 4 or top five right
now<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.939> can't<00:01:39.090> tell<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:39.930> teams<00:01:40.170> are

now like you can't tell which teams are
top<00:01:40.439> five<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.909> seemed<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
top five but it all seemed to have a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.560 
top five but it all seemed to have a
positive<00:01:42.750> effect<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.890> am<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:44.790> worried<00:01:45.390> about

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
