00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
there was a piece of fitness equipment

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.509 
there was a piece of fitness equipment
voilá<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:08.040> would<00:00:08.189> give<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.429> same

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
results as liposuction without the knife

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.980 
results as liposuction without the knife
and<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.700> would<00:00:11.880> reduce<00:00:12.030> cellulite<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.840> boot

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990

let's<00:00:32.640> take<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> step<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.270> time

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
let's take it a step at a time

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
let's take it a step at a time
first<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> looks

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
first of all just what is this it looks

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090 
first of all just what is this it looks
like<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.969> major<00:00:36.329> machine<00:00:36.960> piece<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
like a major machine piece here it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680 
like a major machine piece here it
really<00:00:38.670> does<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.480> very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
really does you know but it's not very

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.400 
really does you know but it's not very
complicated

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
complicated

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
complicated
it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.219> call<00:00:41.910> devaki<00:00:42.180> step<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.750> made<00:00:42.899> in

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it's a call devaki step it's made in

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
it's a call devaki step it's made in
Germany<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.980> size<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.579> simple

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Germany and in size just a simple

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
Germany and in size just a simple
elliptical<00:00:45.629> machine<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
elliptical machine see that's what I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.049 
elliptical machine see that's what I
didn't<00:00:46.860> realize<00:00:47.190> until<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.940> it's

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
didn't realize until I you know it's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
didn't realize until I you know it's
taller<00:00:48.300> than<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.410> our<00:00:49.559> cameras<00:00:49.890> show

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
taller than me but if our cameras show

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.400 
taller than me but if our cameras show
you<00:00:50.160> inside<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.449> an<00:00:51.539> elliptical<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you inside it's an elliptical so in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
you inside it's an elliptical so in
other<00:00:52.500> words<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:52.920> step<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
other words you just step up and do the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.459 
other words you just step up and do the
elliptical<00:00:54.980> absolutely<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.289> how<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
elliptical absolutely and the how it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
elliptical absolutely and the how it
works<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.640> while<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
works is that there while you're in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
works is that there while you're in
there<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.680> vacuum<00:01:02.010> environment

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
there you're in a vacuum environment

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.250 
there you're in a vacuum environment
which<00:01:02.969> dilate<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.600> blood<00:01:03.809> vessels

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
which dilate your blood vessels

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
which dilate your blood vessels
increases<00:01:05.010> blood<00:01:05.159> flow<00:01:05.390> increases<00:01:06.390> oxygen

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
increases blood flow increases oxygen

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
increases blood flow increases oxygen
flow<00:01:07.260> therefore<00:01:07.619> increases<00:01:08.159> fat<00:01:08.310> problem

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
flow therefore increases fat problem

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.649 
flow therefore increases fat problem
okay<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> show<00:01:09.240> people<00:01:09.270> what

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
okay I want to show people what

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.440 
okay I want to show people what
Josephine<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.200> putting<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.920> quickly

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
Josephine is putting on really quickly

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
Josephine is putting on really quickly
so<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.570> R<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.140> swivel<00:01:13.530> around<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so if R we can swivel around here it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
so if R we can swivel around here it
looks<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.750> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
looks like a little I don't know if that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
looks like a little I don't know if that
really<00:01:16.409> start<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.790> this

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320 
on any kind of exercise machine it's a
good<00:03:17.010> idea<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> major

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
good idea because we have a major

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.450 
good idea because we have a major
problem<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.810> obesity<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.500> country<00:03:19.890> does

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
problem with obesity this country does

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.810 
problem with obesity this country does
this<00:03:21.210> do<00:03:21.810> anything<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:22.680> addition<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.550> a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
this do anything in addition to a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.080 
this do anything in addition to a
stepper<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.320> jury<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.520> my<00:03:26.850> mind

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090

and I am I love you guys it's like this
is<00:03:30.870> what<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:31.740> we<00:03:32.160> need<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.520> do<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.910> get

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
is what I think we need to do is get

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.280 
is what I think we need to do is get
some<00:03:33.960> data<00:03:34.670> scientific<00:03:35.670> data<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:37.020> prove

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
some data scientific data to prove

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.140 
some data scientific data to prove
whether<00:03:37.710> it's<00:03:37.980> better<00:03:38.250> than<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.940> regular

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
whether it's better than a regular

whether it's better than a regular
stepping<00:03:39.840> mission<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.410> somebody<00:03:40.680> like

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
stepping mission you think somebody like

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.230 
stepping mission you think somebody like
me<00:03:41.010> I'm<00:03:41.100> not<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.310> doctor<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.700> he<00:03:41.820> tells<00:03:42.000> me<00:03:42.090> it's

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
me I'm not a doctor and he tells me it's

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.730 
me I'm not a doctor and he tells me it's
doing<00:03:42.450> something<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:42.930> blood<00:03:43.140> vessels<00:03:43.560> or

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
doing something to my blood vessels or

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.960 
doing something to my blood vessels or
what<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> doing<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.490> are<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.610> talking

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
what is it doing what are you talking

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.700 
what is it doing what are you talking
what<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> would<00:03:45.300> use<00:03:45.510> what<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:45.780> say<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.290> dilate

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
what it would use what we say to dilate

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.440 
what it would use what we say to dilate
your<00:03:46.890> blood<00:03:47.040> vessels<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.210> idea

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
your blood vessels and that's the idea

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.970 
your blood vessels and that's the idea
to<00:03:48.540> back<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.840> thiolate<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.350> blood<00:03:49.500> vessels

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
to back in thiolate your blood vessels

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.500 
to back in thiolate your blood vessels
vessels<00:03:50.520> therefore<00:03:50.880> increases<00:03:51.240> blood<00:03:51.390> flow

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
vessels therefore increases blood flow

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.480 
vessels therefore increases blood flow
which<00:03:52.140> will<00:03:52.290> increase<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> oxygen<00:03:53.250> flow<00:03:53.430> of

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
which will increase the oxygen flow of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.660 
which will increase the oxygen flow of
fat<00:03:53.730> burn<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.270> dr.<00:03:54.920> dr.<00:03:55.920> Mike<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.220> right<00:03:56.430> and

we were looking for data also so we

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.440 
we were looking for data also so we
didn't<00:03:59.400> want<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.580> take<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> manufacturers

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
didn't want to take the manufacturers

Josephine I want to ask you though I

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.790 
Josephine I want to ask you though I
just<00:04:24.699> hear<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.150> sucking<00:04:25.840> sound<00:04:26.259> what<00:04:26.710> does

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
just hear this sucking sound what does

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.050 
just hear this sucking sound what does
it<00:04:26.949> feel<00:04:27.099> like<00:04:27.159> right<00:04:27.520> now<00:04:27.639> when<00:04:27.849> you're<00:04:27.970> doing

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
it feel like right now when you're doing

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.320 
it feel like right now when you're doing
this<00:04:28.210> feels<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.169> waste<00:04:29.849> this<00:04:30.849> is<00:04:30.909> getting

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
this feels like a waste this is getting

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.089 
this feels like a waste this is getting
tighter<00:04:31.599> and<00:04:31.900> it's<00:04:32.169> basically<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.770> vectors

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
tighter and it's basically the vectors

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.409 
tighter and it's basically the vectors
pulling<00:04:33.430> all<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.669> air<00:04:33.789> out<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:34.240> getting

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
pulling all the air out so it's getting

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.020 
pulling all the air out so it's getting
tighter<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.319> more<00:04:35.729> resistance<00:04:36.729> for<00:04:36.940> me

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
tighter and it's more resistance for me

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.240 
tighter and it's more resistance for me
to<00:04:37.120> keep<00:04:37.270> stepping<00:04:37.780> all<00:04:38.199> right<00:04:38.409> well<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.680> say

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
to keep stepping all right well I say

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.140 
to keep stepping all right well I say
they<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.610> feels<00:04:39.759> like<00:04:39.909> you're<00:04:40.030> walking

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
they it feels like you're walking

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.119 
they it feels like you're walking
underwater<00:04:40.509> and<00:04:40.900> wet<00:04:41.080> sand<00:04:41.379> so<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
underwater and wet sand so the

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.839 
underwater and wet sand so the
resistance<00:04:42.580> helps<00:04:44.220> that's<00:04:45.220> part<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.729> work

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
resistance helps that's part of the work

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.309 
resistance helps that's part of the work
well<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.150> tell<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.479> what<00:04:46.659> Tom<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.139> are<00:04:47.169> a
