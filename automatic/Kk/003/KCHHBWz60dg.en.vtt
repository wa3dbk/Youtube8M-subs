00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.819
 and 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 and one to continue aspiring to be in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.900
 the level where I was needed to do 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
 things better with the same thing 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 we were doing we were not going to be able to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.710
 get we had many opportunities 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619
 when you take so many risks to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.700
 attack it is feasible that the last line 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.520
 be exposed 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.770
 If this transition is what the team 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.630
 needs to improve considerably 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.719
 we have received an election on the subject 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 tactical for example we can say that the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.600
 adversary always playing with a line 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.269
 of five 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 this one that played populated half of the center 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.890
 of the field with six midfielders for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.600
 can block our circuits 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 work on it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.429
 and it complicated us a lot in that sense 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 it means that the times in our 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.510
 the adversary has seen the ability to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 our team and then he threw back 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.429
 to work in that sense he caught us wrong 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.290
 stopped sometimes and that's the 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.170
 lesson is to say that there are teams that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.860
 they are watching how we play and not here not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 there are fools in the weeks that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.930
 I say they continue after the defeats 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.630
 They are only important to me asking 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.280
 it was learned I think we learned a 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.230
 thing but let's see how the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.030
 players from here to the day that the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.940
 next game we will see how much 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.370
 weight it hurt me a lot to lose the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.080
 I really did not think I was not in the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.510
 budget lose this match the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.760
 true no no no no I did not consider it a 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.920
 match to be able to lose it if it is 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.240
 important that jalisco science is 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.060
 important that the street is also 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.830
 well that the game does not need a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.500
 good court it is important that light 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.920
 it is well we are interested in them 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.479
 the two tournaments and the cup also serves 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 so that some are in a 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.940
 the best level is this search of the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.250
 balance that we have to risk 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.770
 a lot and have solutions when you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.290
 loses the ball is the challenge of this 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.160
 season we do not want to go and look for the goal 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.000
 the adversary goal as as as 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.800
 launch platform and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.630
 of course if we do not find the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.690
 balance we will be struggling with 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 these things do not I do not think it's a matter 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 of quality nor a matter of scheme for 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 I would seem a matter of coordination and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.870
 that we need to find numbers 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.940
