00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.139
 hello in this video I'm going to give you a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.620
 option to have a colored hair 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.960
 Violet 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.990
 if you like I say you intend to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.940
 apply a violet tint on the hair 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.140
 well perfectly so you can apply 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.359
 a chestnut or some blondes 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.200
 with violet tones is worth with reflection 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.360
 Violet 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.920
 what would happen each apply the dye then 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.290
 As you know, you would have a color 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.390
 uniform throughout the hair then 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.180
 this option that I am going to give you is for 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.210
 give more brightness more luminosity and that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 highlight the violet tone 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.550
 How we do it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.820
 In the beginning we wanted to find a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.159
 dominant color the base color that is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 dark for example a medium brown is 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.430
 pretty good a medium violet chestnut 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.530
 a 465 is pretty good we would apply 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.930
 the dye on all the hair first what 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.660
 we would let act the 25-30 minutes 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.060
 once we remove all the product 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.640
 we wash our hair well we hydrate it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.390
 we apply a little mask so that 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 recover a little hair quality 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 and we remove the humidity 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.080
 Once this is done, what are we going to do? 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.190
 is to make wicks to all the hair in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.750
 the in the middle and outer part not in the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.509
 area of ​​the interior the area of ​​the interior 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 let's leave the dark ones but if the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.560
 part of the media and the outside of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.899
 hair because there will wicks the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
 Wicks do not make all of them stuck together 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.300
 root because it does not look good is better in 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.759
 this type of work make wicks 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.940
 some stuck to the root and another to a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.850
 centimeter more down centimeter and a half 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.460
 interspersed the heights is worth and always 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.440
 in finite wicks we are going to prepare 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.110
 discoloration with water of 20 volumes 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.100
 nothing else because we do not want to make a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.620
 very aggressive discoloration very strong is 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 simply so that it diffuses a little bit 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 the pigments that of the color that we have 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.590
 recently applied the chestnut the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.490
 we are going to let act only about 10 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.680
 minutes go to all the wicks 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.450
 just a little 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.209
 and let 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.480
 the hair we wash all the wicks 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.120
 again once this is done we prepare a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.690
 blond dark violet 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.360
 1 6 and 5 for example as you will see it is much 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.269
 brighter the violet has more strength 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.450
 but we are going to mix it in equal parts 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.610
 with water of 10 volumes is worth not as 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.099
 has done with the dye that was applied with 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.190
 20 water volumes we will apply 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.590
 with 10-volume water 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.560
 once we make the mixture what 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.320
 we apply on all the hair that in this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.690
 they will not have problems because 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.880
 by not producing a chemical reaction what 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.850
 what is going to do is that in the part that the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.280
 hair is dyed chestnut is not going 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.920
 to touch is not going to affect just goes 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.170
 to bring a little bit of light but 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 in the part where the wicks were made 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.030
 there it will penetrate because the cuticles 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.490
 they are open because they have worked 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.190
 there with discoloration the cuticles are 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.460
 open to penetrate the product worth 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.670
 and it will catch a more violet tone 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.940
 bright brighter and we leave it 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.100
 act about 30 minutes and then already 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.390
 we wash and we do hydrate the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.080
 hair and hairstyle and you will see how the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.910
 tonality of being this work that does not 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.490
 only apply a root dye to 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.020
 lace is because because when applying 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.570
 the dye as already explained in others 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.730
 videos is a uniform color and this 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.620
 what we do is to highlight 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.099
 much more the violet but 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.220
 in the form of very finite wicks then 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.709
 it will give more luminosity more color 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.620
 more shine to your hair and you will see more 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:21.169
 the violet reflections try it and you will see 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.169
 what will you like until another video
