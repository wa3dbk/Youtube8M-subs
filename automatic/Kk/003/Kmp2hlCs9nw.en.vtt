explaining at all um yeah yeah that's it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.110 
explaining at all um yeah yeah that's it
still<00:00:33.450> three<00:00:34.170> villas<00:00:34.829> there<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.000> other

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
still three villas there and the other

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290 
still three villas there and the other
three<00:00:36.510> um<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.500> can't<00:00:37.890> run<00:00:38.430> less<00:00:38.760> than<00:00:39.030> three

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
three um you can't run less than three

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
three um you can't run less than three
because<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.010> each<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because you're on two of each if you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
because you're on two of each if you
draw<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> each<00:00:42.480> first<00:00:42.840> hand<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.559> an

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
draw one of each first hand that's an

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
draw one of each first hand that's an
automatic<00:00:43.950> scoop<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.520> cannot<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.539> anything

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
automatic scoop you cannot do anything

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.040 
automatic scoop you cannot do anything
so<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.680> need<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> run<00:00:47.160> three<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> each

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
so you need to run three of each

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.790 
so you need to run three of each
