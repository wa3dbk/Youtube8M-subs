 analogy 'well in fact already started and 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.989
 are beginning the words of the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.479
 undersecretary of communications and 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.410
 how are you good night how are the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.290

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.570
 yes 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.490
 that is draining her very good night in 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.740
 these moments already the word took the 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.040
 undersecretary of communications and 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.930
 transportes jose ignacio I want to comment 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.730
 that previously took the floor the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.940
 holder of the federal commission of 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.100
 telecommunications who assured that the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 date to be carried out in 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.330
 our country the so-called 'blackout 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.690
 analog ' has no reverse left 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.640
 very clear this and also pointed out that the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 procedures and dates that are left 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 pending for the other cities that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.990
 are left in this process of digitization 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.509
 could undergo some adjustments but that 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.150
 that does not mean that there are going to 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.250
 listen to the words of the undersecretary 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.470
 What is the radio spectrum? 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.050
 in bands where you could before 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 transmit only one television channel 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.509
 today it is possible to add more channels and 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.690
 forms of information transmission 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.130
 images and sound in this way there will be 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.950
 increased competition among providers 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 of the service that will result in minors 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.590
 advertising costs and therefore in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.460
 lower costs for products like this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 also like 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 diversity and quality of services 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 telecommunications secondly it 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.470
 releases one of the segments of the spectrum 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.700
 more suitable for radio 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 extend the coverage of 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.989
 broadband telecommunications that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.290
 they are keys for personal prosperity 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:21.550
 social integrity and competitiveness 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.959
 of mexico in third place the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.450
 opportunity for you to believe that the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.880
 broadband service under principles 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.209
 of competition free competition and 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.160
 public-private partnership by going to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.610
 day technology trends at the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.790
 world, the Mexican state strengthens its 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.670
 rectory in the field of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.060
 telecommunications 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.730
 this beginning of the so-called analog blackout 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.160
 analog complements the recent 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.670
 constitutional reform in matters of 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.739
 telecommunications the reform was 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.989
 enriched and approved by the majority in 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.810
 the federal congress and has also been 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.360
 approved by the absolute majority of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.569
 the legislative powers in the states 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.370
 of the republic the reform facilitates the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.130
 regulation of telecommunications and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.590
 of broadcasting with a sense with 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.680
 a sense of openness and development to 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.050
 same time is consistent with the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.430
 rights of Mexicans to access 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.000
