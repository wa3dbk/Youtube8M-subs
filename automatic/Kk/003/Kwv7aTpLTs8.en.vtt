00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
see I've been having a lot of lately

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.500 
see I've been having a lot of lately
I've<00:02:28.590> been<00:02:28.739> fiddling<00:02:29.190> around<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.640> ladders

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I've been fiddling around with ladders

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.170 
I've been fiddling around with ladders
or<00:02:31.470> ladders<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.430> elevators<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:35.880> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
or ladders and elevators so I think you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.929 
or ladders and elevators so I think you
have<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.540> go

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.390 

again<00:02:39.939> ladder<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.870> elevators<00:02:41.560> guys<00:02:41.799> are<00:02:42.069> such

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
again ladder and elevators guys are such

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.250 
again ladder and elevators guys are such
as<00:02:42.609> such<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:42.879> difficult<00:02:43.450> thing<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.659> fiddle<00:02:44.109> with

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
as such a difficult thing to fiddle with

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.309 
as such a difficult thing to fiddle with
in<00:02:44.500> Minecraft<00:02:45.310> I've<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:46.299> my<00:02:46.510> creative<00:02:46.959> world<00:02:47.140> I

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
in Minecraft I've in my creative world I

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.809 
in Minecraft I've in my creative world I
got<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> whole<00:02:47.799> bunch<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.189> these<00:02:48.310> towers

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
got a whole bunch of these towers

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.690 
got a whole bunch of these towers
stand-in<00:02:49.239> there<00:02:49.359> I<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.340> might<00:02:51.519> have<00:02:51.609> been

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
stand-in there I think I might have been

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.910 
stand-in there I think I might have been
going<00:02:51.879> in<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.150> wrong<00:02:52.239> side<00:02:52.719> maybe<00:02:53.170> oh<00:02:53.439> maybe<00:02:53.769> I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
going in the wrong side maybe oh maybe I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.309 
going in the wrong side maybe oh maybe I
didn't<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.549> wrong<00:02:54.760> side<00:02:55.000> but<00:02:55.780> they're

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
didn't go on the wrong side but they're

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.580 
didn't go on the wrong side but they're
very<00:02:56.560> very<00:02:56.709> messed<00:02:57.219> up<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> sense<00:02:57.969> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
very very messed up in the sense that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.949 
very very messed up in the sense that
they<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.950> be<00:03:00.129> directional<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.060> there's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
they have to be directional and there's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.170 
they have to be directional and there's
a<00:03:02.079> lot<00:03:02.319> of<00:03:02.439> things<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.980> lot<00:03:03.219> of<00:03:03.639> kind<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:03.969> works

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
a lot of things a lot of kind of works

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
a lot of things a lot of kind of works
they<00:03:04.719> almost<00:03:04.930> always<00:03:05.319> glitch<00:03:05.859> out<00:03:07.200> especially

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
they almost always glitch out especially

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.140 
they almost always glitch out especially
in<00:03:08.650> certain<00:03:08.920> worlds<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.549> worlds<00:03:09.849> like<00:03:09.939> this
