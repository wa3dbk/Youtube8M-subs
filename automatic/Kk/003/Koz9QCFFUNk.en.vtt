hard time figuring out how you use the
Smart<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.160> thought<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.730> would<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:08.940> show<00:00:09.240> you

Smart on I thought I would just show you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.060 
Smart on I thought I would just show you
my<00:00:09.540> settings<00:00:10.050> because<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.440> didn't<00:00:10.830> have<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
my settings because I didn't have to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.919 
my settings because I didn't have to
play<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> while<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.269> right<00:00:12.540> but

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
play with in a while to get it right but

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.099 
play with in a while to get it right but
now<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.440> works<00:00:13.679> perfect<00:00:14.190> every<00:00:14.549> time<00:00:14.870> you<00:00:15.870> feel

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
now it works perfect every time you feel

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260 
now it works perfect every time you feel
a<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.410> vibration<00:00:17.160> once<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.580> touch<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
a little vibration once you touch it and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
a little vibration once you touch it and
by<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.350> look<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.770> lock<00:00:19.920> screen<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
by the way look at my lock screen you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
by the way look at my lock screen you
see<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.910> i'm<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> show<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.750> how

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
see that i'm going to show you all how

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:33.709 
see that i'm going to show you all how
to<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.740> any<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:27.050> off<00:00:28.789> um<00:00:32.719> you

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
to do that in any way so on off um you

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
to do that in any way so on off um you
have<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> wait<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> few<00:00:34.590> seconds<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> between

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
have to wait a few seconds in between

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
have to wait a few seconds in between
tabs<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.969> think<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> preserves<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
tabs I think that's how it preserves the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.540 
tabs I think that's how it preserves the
battery<00:00:38.450> um<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.739> always<00:00:43.860> tell<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
battery um I can always tell because you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.279 
battery um I can always tell because you
feel<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> vibration<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> feedback

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
feel the vibration I have the feedback

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
feel the vibration I have the feedback
so<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.430> I've<00:00:47.579> done<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.120> by<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> way

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so what I've done and by the way

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
so what I've done and by the way
sometimes<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> app<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.620> shut<00:00:49.860> itself<00:00:50.039> off

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
sometimes the app will shut itself off

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
sometimes the app will shut itself off
I'm<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:50.969> why<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:52.140> shows<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I'm not sure why right there shows that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
I'm not sure why right there shows that
it's<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.370> notifications<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.289> ever

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's on in notifications but if you ever

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's on in notifications but if you ever
do<00:00:55.770> feel<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.820> working<00:00:57.239> like

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
do feel that it's not working like

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.729 
do feel that it's not working like
you've<00:00:57.629> tried<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.379> three<00:00:58.440> times

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you've tried like two or three times

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
you've tried like two or three times
sometimes<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.670> will<00:00:59.820> shut<00:01:00.090> itself<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sometimes it will shut itself off so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
sometimes it will shut itself off so
what<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> would<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> case<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:04.430> try<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
what you would do in that case is try to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
what you would do in that case is try to
turn<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.630> working<00:01:07.080> turn<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
turn it on it's not working turn on the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.420 
turn it on it's not working turn on the
regular<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:10.500> app<00:01:10.680> itself<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
regular way you go to the app itself I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.590 
regular way you go to the app itself I
keep<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> shortcut<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:16.939> keep<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.119> shortcut

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
keep a shortcut of it I keep a shortcut

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.890 
keep a shortcut of it I keep a shortcut
and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.920> hit<00:01:20.159> save<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> restart<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
that'll bring it right back on okay but
anyway<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.320> um<00:01:25.700> settings<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.390> our

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
see I have it on 24 25 milliseconds for

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
see I have it on 24 25 milliseconds for
fifty<00:01:37.439> eight<00:01:37.590> milliseconds<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.880> going

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
fifty eight milliseconds and I'm going

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
fifty eight milliseconds and I'm going
to<00:01:39.240> disable<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> second<00:01:40.470> vibration<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
to disable for the second vibration and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.139 
to disable for the second vibration and
it<00:01:41.790> works<00:01:42.030> ninety-nine<00:01:42.869> percent<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> time

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
it works ninety-nine percent of the time

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.370

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
we would go to messaging and you just go

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:48.960 
we would go to messaging and you just go
to<00:02:41.190> settings<00:02:42.630> or<00:02:43.630> somewhere<00:02:44.140> i<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:48.670> have<00:02:48.850> to

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
is it doesn't let me because it only

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.180 
is it doesn't let me because it only
