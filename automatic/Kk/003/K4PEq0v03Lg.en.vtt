00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.339
 hello to everyone now i will tell a few 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.009
 ways to open the door 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.750
 cars if moving blocked 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:20.680
 And so the machine in particular, we have 3g 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:24.880
 here is such a door for us to open 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.650
 In general, the first thing to do is 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.060
 turn on the pump in particular here 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.500
 the possibility of water remaining in the machine 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.680
 as soon as the water comes out there it will work 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.950
 Relyushka and the door will open but not immediately 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.180
 after about 30 seconds the second method 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.440
 You can turn off the power also the machine 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 can work if it is not on the lock 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.570
 no power over for my 30 seconds 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.170
 here you can wait to 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.230
 for sure 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.920
 if not open start the third one helps 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.530
 way to press rinse + spin too 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.040
 may I help 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 fourth way to run again 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 washing programs 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.310
 all is completely unimportant how much it will be 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.400
 run the next way this is already to this 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.430
 one hundred percent 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.640
 we run the store we buy 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.030
 here's a spatula in particular here 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.500
 but to put a spatula 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.860
 in the middle of the machine is a tongue 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 take a spatula for what you need to 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 rushed thrust 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.840
 in the middle we press on the tongue 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 unbent machine opens that is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 why did she open up because if u 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 you on the face here is such a tongue which 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:07.470
 walks back here we have a long spatula and here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.300
 on this part and it bends narrow narrow it right 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.520
 here is perfect if you do not have 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.580
 spatula or later and he for not run 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.250
 You can try the spatula store 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.380
 which thread I will not show you in 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.190
 general thread is long and durable is taken 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.519
 here is the water neatly 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.500
 here here is laid from this side 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:41.209
 the same principle works 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.660
 the door opens there 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.769
 next way 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:51.380
 a few hemorrhoids explain it too 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.380
 look at the tongue 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.980
 This move machine also show not 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.790
 I will be ordinary in theory we move the machine 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.930
 on themselves from the colonies a little bit back in 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:45.060
 that side is not rising from not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:45.060
 pick up there will be a small square 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.930
 we 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.590
 pretty 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.590
 flashlight 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.110
 didn't catch up 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:18.230
 number is right but where it comes from 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:22.209
 true and idle 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.209
 either as an object open
