00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
gameplay for this is going to be sped up

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.680 
gameplay for this is going to be sped up
a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.219> bit<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.610> had<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.120> speed<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.450> up<00:00:12.509> one

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
a little bit I had to speed it up one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.360 
a little bit I had to speed it up one
hundred<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:12.990> seventy<00:00:13.410> percent<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:14.009> make<00:00:14.160> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
hundred and seventy percent to make that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.580 
hundred and seventy percent to make that
three<00:00:14.820> minute<00:00:15.089> time<00:00:15.269> window<00:00:15.740> but<00:00:17.240> here<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.330> go

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
three minute time window but here we go

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.529 
three minute time window but here we go
you<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.800> there<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> got<00:00:20.250> some<00:00:20.490> barrels<00:00:21.150> that

bottom i have a HUD that got cut off
from<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> recording<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:32.149> just<00:00:33.149> running

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
from the recording and just running

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.810 
from the recording and just running
around<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.440> goal<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> pick<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> fuel

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
around the goal is to pick up the fuel

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
around the goal is to pick up the fuel
cells<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.710> kill<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.280> enemies<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.450> then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
make it to the spaceship so it's the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
make it to the spaceship so it's the
three-part<00:00:42.870> quest<00:00:43.280> those<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> fuel

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
three-part quest those are the fuel

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.770 
three-part quest those are the fuel
cells<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:46.789> running<00:00:47.789> through<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.300> got<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
cells and running through here got a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
cells and running through here got a
couple<00:00:49.020> sentry<00:00:49.500> guns<00:00:49.710> overhead<00:00:50.160> I'm<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
couple sentry guns overhead I'm going to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
couple sentry guns overhead I'm going to
shoot<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> kill

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.240 

um<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:57.300> can't<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.110> this<00:00:58.290> screen<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
um you can't see it in this screen but I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
um you can't see it in this screen but I
actually<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.239> counter<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
actually have a little counter at the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
actually have a little counter at the
top<00:01:01.320> left<00:01:01.559> corner<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.820> keeping<00:01:03.149> track

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
top left corner and it's keeping track

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.969 
top left corner and it's keeping track
of<00:01:03.979> how<00:01:04.979> many<00:01:05.040> fuel<00:01:05.460> cells<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.860> so

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
pick up couple more fuel cells those

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.780 
pick up couple more fuel cells those
were<00:01:23.399> health<00:01:23.640> packs<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.520> notice

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
15 fuel cells so we got to come up and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.260 
15 fuel cells so we got to come up and
find<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.649> here<00:01:40.759> good<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.940> see<00:01:42.149> the
