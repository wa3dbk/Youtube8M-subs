then the heads separate it's just a
couple<00:01:02.960> bolts<00:01:03.260> just<00:01:03.620> bolt<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.339> right<00:01:04.369> in<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
couple bolts just bolt it right in and

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.560 
couple bolts just bolt it right in and
the<00:01:05.840> foot<00:01:06.740> stirrup<00:01:07.130> put<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.450> then

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the foot stirrup put that in and then

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.649 
the foot stirrup put that in and then
have<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.170> make<00:01:09.409> sure<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:09.950> align<00:01:10.220> your

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
have to make sure that you align your

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.880 
have to make sure that you align your
string<00:01:11.659> properly<00:01:12.229> under<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
string properly under here in the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.300 
string properly under here in the
channel<00:01:13.360> there's<00:01:14.360> actually<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:15.380> string

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
channel there's actually a string

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.020 
channel there's actually a string
dampener<00:01:16.909> in<00:01:17.420> there<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.380> they<00:01:18.499> give<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:19.030> so

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
dampener in there that they give you so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:35.209 
dampener in there that they give you so
get<00:01:20.359> a<00:01:20.420> little<00:01:20.539> closer<00:01:20.840> look<00:01:20.990> at<00:01:21.289> it

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.270 

and<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.969> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.570> here's<00:01:36.749> your

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
and as you can see here here's your

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.690 
and as you can see here here's your
safety<00:01:39.350> obviously<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.859> only<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.219> go<00:01:41.460> into

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
safety obviously it's only gonna go into

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.399 
safety obviously it's only gonna go into
safe<00:01:41.909> whenever<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.569> fold<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
safe whenever there is a fold in it

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
safe whenever there is a fold in it
it's<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> full<00:01:46.859> trigger<00:01:47.130> guard<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:48.270> has

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it's not a full trigger guard it has

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.730 
it's not a full trigger guard it has
this<00:01:48.719> solid<00:01:49.619> piece<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:52.109> then<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
this solid piece here and then I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.959 
this solid piece here and then I
actually<00:01:53.009> thought<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.459> was<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.819> be

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
actually thought this was going to be

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.449 
actually thought this was going to be
kind<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> skinny<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> pictures<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> looks

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
kind of skinny in the pictures it looks

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.609 
kind of skinny in the pictures it looks
sort<00:01:56.459> of<00:01:56.520> skinny<00:01:56.789> but<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.500> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
sort of skinny but it's actually as you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.870 
sort of skinny but it's actually as you
can<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.429> thick<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.729> one

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
can see here pretty thick and this one

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.059 
can see here pretty thick and this one
comes<00:02:03.090> equipped<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.719> acti<00:02:04.500> drove<00:02:04.709> 50

there's<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> pulley<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.780> would<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:14.810> pull

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
there's a pulley you would just pull

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.809 
there's a pulley you would just pull
this<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.170> whole<00:02:16.319> way<00:02:16.349> down<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.430> get<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
this the whole way down and get it to

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.750 
this the whole way down and get it to
draw<00:02:18.000> out<00:02:18.180> right<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.190> hook<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
draw out right now but hook it here and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.900 
draw out right now but hook it here and
then<00:02:21.329> as<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.840> pull<00:02:22.049> up<00:02:22.079> those<00:02:22.410> pulleys

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
then as you just pull up those pulleys

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.640 
then as you just pull up those pulleys
