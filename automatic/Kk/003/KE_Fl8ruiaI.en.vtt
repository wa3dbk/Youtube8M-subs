and so what I did is I just drilled a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
and so what I did is I just drilled a
hole<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> one-inch<00:01:20.390> how<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
hole right there with a one-inch how a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.100 
hole right there with a one-inch how a
bit<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.340> I'm<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.110> which

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
bit and I'm going to put in this which

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
bit and I'm going to put in this which
is<00:01:25.140> basically<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.070> transom<00:01:26.460> plug<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
is basically just a transom plug it just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
is basically just a transom plug it just
slips<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
slips right down in here and then that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.109 
slips right down in here and then that
way<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:31.610> what<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> call<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
way we can put in a what do you call it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.420 
way we can put in a what do you call it
a<00:01:33.360> plug<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.890> keep<00:01:35.040> water<00:01:35.310> from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.009 
because we're going to go down with
fiberglass<00:03:18.639> there<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:21.400> thought<00:03:21.669> was<00:03:22.019> of

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
fiberglass there so my thought was of

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.110 
fiberglass there so my thought was of
course<00:03:23.319> we're<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:24.790> layers<00:03:24.970> of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
course we're going to do two layers of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.659 
course we're going to do two layers of
1708<00:03:25.919> going<00:03:26.919> up<00:03:27.010> for<00:03:27.129> the<00:03:27.220> tapping<00:03:27.549> that's

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
1708 going up for the tapping that's

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:28.530 
1708 going up for the tapping that's
that's<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.120> given

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that's a given

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.210 
that's a given
but<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.049> was<00:03:29.169> thinking<00:03:29.410> about<00:03:29.530> doing<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:30.010> layer

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
but I was thinking about doing a layer

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.979 
but I was thinking about doing a layer
of<00:03:30.459> 1708<00:03:31.090> across<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.540> deck<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.900> then

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
of 1708 across the deck and then

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.869 
of 1708 across the deck and then
finishing<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.620> layer<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:32.919> 1.5<00:03:33.549> Alex

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
finishing with a layer of 1.5 Alex

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.509 
finishing with a layer of 1.5 Alex
chopped<00:03:34.090> Strange's<00:03:34.599> for<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> nice<00:03:34.959> finish<00:03:35.519> I'm

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
chopped Strange's for a nice finish I'm

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.180 
chopped Strange's for a nice finish I'm
kind<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.819> torn<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.329> really<00:03:37.930> don't<00:03:38.079> know<00:03:38.260> what<00:03:39.160> I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
kind of torn I really don't know what I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.250 
kind of torn I really don't know what I
want<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.519> do<00:03:39.639> if<00:03:39.819> that's<00:03:39.910> too<00:03:40.209> much<00:03:40.239> or<00:03:41.079> if<00:03:41.199> I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
want to do if that's too much or if I

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.020 
want to do if that's too much or if I
should<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.560> do<00:03:41.709> two<00:03:41.980> layers<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.370> chop<00:03:42.760> strain

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
should just do two layers of chop strain

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.220 
should just do two layers of chop strain
on<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.209> I've<00:03:43.389> got<00:03:43.540> enough<00:03:43.750> for<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.049> do

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
on it I've got enough for it to do

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.520 
on it I've got enough for it to do
either<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:45.069> got<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.669> make<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.940> decision

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
either so I got to make that decision

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.500 
either so I got to make that decision
before<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.790> decide<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.910> put<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.150> stuff<00:03:49.329> over

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
before I decide to put the stuff over

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.750 
before I decide to put the stuff over
the<00:03:49.629> deck<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:49.989> for<00:03:50.169> right<00:03:50.290> now<00:03:50.549> I'm<00:03:51.549> gonna

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the deck but for right now I'm gonna

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.759 
the deck but for right now I'm gonna
turn<00:03:51.879> this<00:03:52.000> fan<00:03:52.239> back<00:03:52.449> on<00:03:52.690> get<00:03:53.349> some<00:03:53.530> comfort

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
turn this fan back on get some comfort

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.369 
turn this fan back on get some comfort
in<00:03:53.919> here<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.389> start<00:03:55.389> cutting<00:03:55.599> all<00:03:55.840> my<00:03:55.870> tabbing

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
in here and start cutting all my tabbing

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.199 
in here and start cutting all my tabbing
what<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.099> doing<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.430> four<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.940> an<00:03:58.060> eight

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
what I'm doing is a four in an eight

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.119 
what I'm doing is a four in an eight
inch<00:03:58.419> strips<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.930> means<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.889> four

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
inch strips that means that the four

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.680 
inch strips that means that the four
inch<00:04:00.280> will<00:04:00.489> be<00:04:00.519> basically<00:04:01.060> 2<00:04:01.239> inches<00:04:01.540> on

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
inch will be basically 2 inches on

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.330 
inch will be basically 2 inches on
either<00:04:01.810> side<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.349> then<00:04:02.500> eighth<00:04:02.889> inch<00:04:03.160> will<00:04:03.310> be

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
either side and then eighth inch will be

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.830 
either side and then eighth inch will be
four<00:04:03.639> inches<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.970> either<00:04:04.060> side<00:04:04.329> over<00:04:04.660> lapping

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
four inches on either side over lapping

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.900 
four inches on either side over lapping
I'm<00:04:05.620> just<00:04:05.799> going<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:05.980> start<00:04:06.099> cutting<00:04:06.310> all<00:04:06.639> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
I'm just going to start cutting all the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.069 
I'm just going to start cutting all the
way<00:04:06.940> around<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.449> I'm<00:04:07.540> going<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.750> overlap

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
way around and I'm going to overlap

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.009 
way around and I'm going to overlap
about<00:04:08.440> yay<00:04:08.829> far<00:04:09.129> on<00:04:09.370> each<00:04:09.519> one<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.940> deal<00:04:10.750> so

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
about yay far on each one of the deal so

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.490 
about yay far on each one of the deal so
that<00:04:11.169> will<00:04:11.260> be<00:04:11.349> nice<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.769> strong<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:13.500> then

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
that will be nice and strong and then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.860 
that will be nice and strong and then
we'll<00:04:14.650> start<00:04:14.829> glassing<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:15.570> main<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.660> tell

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
we'll start glassing that in main I tell

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.439 
we'll start glassing that in main I tell
you<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.199> getting<00:04:17.410> warm<00:04:17.620> quick<00:04:17.889> here<00:04:18.099> today

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
you it's getting warm quick here today

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.050 
you it's getting warm quick here today
but<00:04:19.739> that's<00:04:20.739> what<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.890> get<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.400> buying<00:04:21.909> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
but that's what I get for buying a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.190 
but that's what I get for buying a
rotten<00:04:22.360> boat<00:04:22.570> right

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
rotten boat right

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.960 
rotten boat right
well<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.410> can<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.740> I've<00:04:25.980> got<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.340> tabbing

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
well as you can see I've got the tabbing

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.050 
well as you can see I've got the tabbing
done<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.620> upon<00:04:28.620> second<00:04:29.100> thought<00:04:29.310> we're<00:04:30.030> going

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
done in upon second thought we're going

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.900 
done in upon second thought we're going
to<00:04:30.330> use<00:04:30.450> one<00:04:30.750> layer<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.230> 1708<00:04:31.920> on<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.550> tabbing

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
to use one layer of 1708 on the tabbing

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.430 
to use one layer of 1708 on the tabbing
it's<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.630> two<00:04:33.780> layers<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:34.170> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> be

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
it's just two layers it's going to be

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.630 
it's just two layers it's going to be
too<00:04:34.590> much<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:35.010> going<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.160> create<00:04:35.370> too<00:04:35.520> much

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
too much it's going to create too much

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.100 
too much it's going to create too much
the<00:04:35.850> lip<00:04:36.060> also<00:04:36.630> when<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.680> get<00:04:37.770> down<00:04:37.980> there

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the lip also when you get down there

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.170 
the lip also when you get down there
these<00:04:40.110> boats<00:04:40.380> are<00:04:40.530> never<00:04:40.830> ever<00:04:41.040> an<00:04:41.370> exact

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
these boats are never ever an exact

these boats are never ever an exact
science<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:43.140> got<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.560> roll<00:04:43.830> with

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
science you got to kind of roll with

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.540 
science you got to kind of roll with
punches<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.670> make<00:04:45.300> adjustments<00:04:45.420> as<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.020> go

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550
