suppose<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.989> makes<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> experience<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:24.010> lot

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
suppose it makes the experience a lot

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.979 
suppose it makes the experience a lot
there<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:27.519> map<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> tended<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.540> use<00:02:28.720> either

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
there on this map I tended to use either

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.940 
there on this map I tended to use either
a<00:02:29.380> rifle<00:02:29.890> or<00:02:30.040> an<00:02:30.400> assault<00:02:30.700> rifle<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.860> were

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
a rifle or an assault rifle if you were

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.680 
a rifle or an assault rifle if you were
to<00:02:33.069> try<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.400> use<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.579> sniper<00:02:34.030> rifle<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.540> might

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
to try and use a sniper rifle you might

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.140 
to try and use a sniper rifle you might
struggle<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.760> although<00:02:36.760> some<00:02:37.030> people

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
struggle a bit and although some people

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.120 
struggle a bit and although some people
try<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.510> use<00:02:37.810> them<00:02:38.049> they're<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.769> really<00:02:38.980> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
try and use them they're not really that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.830 
try and use them they're not really that
effective<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.850> they<00:02:39.910> don't<00:02:40.030> play<00:02:40.359> much<00:02:40.540> part

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
effective and they don't play much part

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.910

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
across which I'm on now and that's quite

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
across which I'm on now and that's quite

a<00:03:03.280> nice<00:03:03.430> map<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:05.040> culinary<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.549> didn't

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
a nice map in culinary for you didn't

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.780 
a nice map in culinary for you didn't
usually<00:03:06.910> see<00:03:07.299> these<00:03:07.480> kind<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.900> large<00:03:08.260> maps

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
usually see these kind of large maps

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.099 
usually see these kind of large maps
there<00:03:09.790> was<00:03:09.880> only<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.090> few<00:03:10.389> words<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> beta

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
there was only a few words in the beta

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.229 
there was only a few words in the beta
all<00:03:11.500> three<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:11.980> them<00:03:12.250> seem<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.700> be<00:03:12.790> quite<00:03:12.940> big

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
all three of them seem to be quite big

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.259 
all three of them seem to be quite big
and<00:03:13.450> Mac<00:03:13.720> kin<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.319> definitely<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
and Mac kin is definitely one of the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.780 
and Mac kin is definitely one of the
bigger<00:03:16.450> ones<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:18.459> quite<00:03:18.639> funny

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
bigger ones so it's quite funny

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.000 
bigger ones so it's quite funny
roundhouses<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.120> third<00:03:22.389> map<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.829> only

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
roundhouses the third map is the only

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.860 
roundhouses the third map is the only
map<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.489> debated<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.120> vehicles<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
map and debated to have vehicles and it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.349 
map and debated to have vehicles and it
has<00:03:25.989> two<00:03:26.260> tanks<00:03:26.769> now<00:03:27.549> initially<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.150> thought

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
has two tanks now initially I thought

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.729 
has two tanks now initially I thought
the<00:03:28.510> tanks<00:03:28.780> were<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.079> take<00:03:29.319> a<00:03:29.380> massive

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
the tanks were going to take a massive

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.210 
the tanks were going to take a massive
part<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> game<00:03:30.549> really<00:03:31.150> they<00:03:31.600> don't<00:03:32.220> if

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
part in the game really they don't if

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.559 
part in the game really they don't if
you<00:03:33.489> go<00:03:33.639> around<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.970> edges<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.329> you're

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
you go around the edges and you're

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.590 
you go around the edges and you're
careful<00:03:34.810> then<00:03:35.139> they're<00:03:35.290> not<00:03:35.410> really<00:03:35.590> there

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
careful then they're not really there

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.880 
careful then they're not really there
but<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.810> run<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.260> middle<00:03:38.530> then<00:03:38.800> you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
but if you run it in the middle then you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.530 
but if you run it in the middle then you
can<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.190> either<00:03:39.310> ran<00:03:39.640> over<00:03:40.000> or<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.180> shot

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
can get either ran over or just shot

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.640 
can get either ran over or just shot
straight<00:03:40.690> away<00:03:41.050> so<00:03:41.110> you've<00:03:41.350> got<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.590> be

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
straight away so you've got to be

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.760 
straight away so you've got to be
careful<00:03:43.110> now<00:03:44.110> we're<00:03:44.290> going<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.500> talk<00:03:44.620> about

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
careful now we're going to talk about

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.190 
careful now we're going to talk about
the<00:03:44.950> class<00:03:45.190> creation<00:03:45.700> system<00:03:45.910> now<00:03:46.780> you've<00:03:46.990> got

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
the class creation system now you've got

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.100 
the class creation system now you've got
even<00:03:47.560> more<00:03:47.740> custom<00:03:48.460> slots<00:03:48.820> they<00:03:49.450> go<00:03:49.630> up<00:03:49.750> as<00:03:49.960> you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
even more custom slots they go up as you

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.690 
even more custom slots they go up as you
prestige<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.800> there's<00:03:50.980> actually<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> goal<00:03:51.550> to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
prestige so there's actually a goal to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.270 
prestige so there's actually a goal to
prestige<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.480> now<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.350> more<00:03:53.830> types<00:03:54.100> of

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
entertaining of the new game mode it was

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.440 
entertaining of the new game mode it was
really<00:05:08.620> fun<00:05:08.950> fast-paced<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.270> had

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
really fun fast-paced and it had

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.920 
really fun fast-paced and it had
included<00:05:10.960> really<00:05:11.320> good<00:05:11.470> teamwork<00:05:12.660> but<00:05:13.660> times

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
included really good teamwork but times

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.420 
included really good teamwork but times
it<00:05:14.169> seemed<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.500> little<00:05:14.650> bit<00:05:14.800> easy<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.280> capture

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
it seemed a little bit easy to capture

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.430 
it seemed a little bit easy to capture
the<00:05:15.669> flag<00:05:15.880> but<00:05:16.390> it<00:05:16.780> doesn't<00:05:16.990> really<00:05:17.169> matter

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
the flag but it doesn't really matter

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.590 
the flag but it doesn't really matter
and<00:05:17.560> most<00:05:17.830> people<00:05:18.130> just<00:05:18.160> come<00:05:18.940> back<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.210> get<00:05:19.540> a

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
and most people just come back and get a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.390 
and most people just come back and get a
few<00:05:19.780> kills<00:05:20.050> first<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.710> then<00:05:20.919> they'll<00:05:21.100> go<00:05:21.250> for

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
few kills first and then they'll go for

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.780 
few kills first and then they'll go for
the<00:05:21.460> flags

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.370 

war<00:05:24.790> wasn't<00:05:25.030> really<00:05:25.330> my<00:05:25.450> kind<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.840> thing<00:05:26.050> it

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
war wasn't really my kind of thing it

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.990 
war wasn't really my kind of thing it
seemed<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.740> be<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.920> case<00:05:27.130> where<00:05:27.400> whoever<00:05:27.820> got

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
seemed to be the case where whoever got

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.850 
seemed to be the case where whoever got
the<00:05:28.030> first<00:05:28.270> objective<00:05:28.690> went<00:05:29.290> on<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.620> win<00:05:29.710> the

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
the first objective went on to win the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.390 
the first objective went on to win the
game<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.750> wasn't<00:05:32.470> really<00:05:32.710> playing<00:05:32.860> with<00:05:33.040> proper

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
game I wasn't really playing with proper

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.370 
game I wasn't really playing with proper
team<00:05:33.610> so<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:33.940> can't<00:05:34.300> really<00:05:34.480> say<00:05:34.930> about<00:05:34.960> any

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
team so I can't really say about any

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.590 
team so I can't really say about any
tactics<00:05:35.800> used<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.790> was<00:05:36.970> really<00:05:37.300> really

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
tactics used and it was really really

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.240 
tactics used and it was really really
boring<00:05:37.900> for<00:05:38.200> me<00:05:38.260> so<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.590> just<00:05:38.830> went<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.100> played

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
boring for me so I just went and played

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:47.460 
boring for me so I just went and played
some<00:05:39.310> capture<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.850> flag<00:05:45.930> one<00:05:46.930> thing<00:05:47.140> you<00:05:47.320> guys

I've heard isn't really as good as the
old<00:05:53.050> one<00:05:53.380> included<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.860> before<00:05:54.160> but<00:05:54.640> I'm<00:05:54.760> not

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
old one included it before but I'm not

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.060 
old one included it before but I'm not
really<00:05:55.120> sure<00:05:55.270> why<00:05:55.660> I<00:05:55.960> think<00:05:56.500> it's<00:05:56.890> because

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
really sure why I think it's because

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.590 
really sure why I think it's because
people<00:05:57.220> don't<00:05:57.610> know<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:57.910> maps<00:05:58.120> as<00:05:58.270> well<00:05:58.300> and
