00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.429
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.750
 another video 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.289
 I just wanted to do a short video 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.210
 To you a very good case for the sony 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.230
 to show xperia z1 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.150
 we have the phone in front of us 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 has such a bit angular design 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.269
 and behind it is quite smooth so that it 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 slips out of hand and on easily 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 Of course you also have a page on the pages 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 few of these work and so on 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 you do not want to touch constantly 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 and it can also very easily sag that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.760
 whole housing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 That's why I have such a small 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.620
 genius ps bought on Amazon 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 and here is the telex the good thing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 this case is that it definitely 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.559
 made of silicone so it can do that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.239
 do not scratch whole part 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 secondly, that has a fluted 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.340
 surface here and on these others 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.710
 thirdly, it is transparent what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.320
 was very important to me because the mobile phone yes 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.320
 Such a beautiful look it wanted the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.950
 optically not lose a whole case 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.970
 this is also possible with this cheese 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.140
 Of course you have the whole 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 recesses for the camera for her 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.409
 the speaker down here to the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 pages you have this for a unlock 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.840
 button to have it synonymous of course for 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.820
 has the jack connection s.der side 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 but only two recesses once in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.920
 the middle for the dock connection and 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 up here once for the usb charging cable 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.840
 connection so let's get the device 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.480
 put it in there and look at it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:09.580
 we by 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:12.700
 Just do it here from one side purely 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.950
 It is very easy to apply and that 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.380
 sits very tight so it is not as 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.780
 if you look that out of the bag 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.850
 or in there or play around with it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.900
 somehow that became or abolishes 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.700
 So here it looks like it looks 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.730
 in the back you can see the color 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.370
 from the device and the sony ship to and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 so on up here as said the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 Camera opening on the sides of the find 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.940
 I'm so great that that's like and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 You can use the phone very well in the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.090
 hold hand without risk to run this 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.680
 is slipping the keys here 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.990
 camera button and whim liza li are under 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.970
 So the case does not have its own 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.220
 cut up so you have to watch that one 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.960
 here a little bit tight presses for 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.670
 actuate 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.680
 but it is not so difficult 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 They are made of aluminum, too 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.400
 the solid as otherwise it is quite 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.020
 good party unlock works just fine because we 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.380
 is out front we have here where 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.760
 it gets a bit high so if 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.760
 you get that on the table 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.209
 The display is not at the bottom 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.980
 and that's why it's pretty good 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.239
 that it stands a bit high here 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.580
 Of course you do not have the front side 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.430
 So you can also sp protection film or 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.010
 so what to wear on this page like 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.300
 said it is only the dock connection and 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.489
 Here again USB connection is free 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.250
 and you can use that as well 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.400
 charged several times 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.930
 it's much better 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.200
 So I do not know if it's docked 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.780
 will work for this is hole 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.480
 yes thought that it still with the case 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.959
 but that's how you work on the dock 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.170
 yes here next to this excerpt here 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.030
 This upscale area so I would 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.299
 say that we do not really work 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.189
 I did not have that with the case yet 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.430
 but if I have it I will 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.470
 try and report it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.870
 otherwise works very well you can 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.280
 the conditions loose with one 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.120
 agreement as usual and much much 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.410
 better in the hand 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.500
 so I have a clear and me 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.030
 would also recommend you 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.380
 it was thank you for watching 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.380
 see you next time
