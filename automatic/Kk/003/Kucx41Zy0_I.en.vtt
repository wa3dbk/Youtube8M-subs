00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.867
 Last season ... 

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:12.133
 This is a colonoscopy that confirms that I have not eaten seafood for seven years ... And the more Botafumeiro * 

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:18.533
 Well, it seems that everything is already justified, when it comes to the money I've wasted, according to Sandro. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.867
 Wait, because we have a bill here .. For what? For six jot ham? 

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:27.300
 Soaps, soaps! Six jot of soap! ** 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.500
 We can not skimp on the hygiene of employees at Camp Nou. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.233
 Well, yes, but 300,000 euros have still to be checked. 

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.533
 We can not hide it anymore, you have to say it. 

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.000
 Jan, you do not have to explain anything. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.067
 If I tell them the truth, they will understand. Give a video. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.067
 If I tell them the truth, they will understand. Give a video. 

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.367
 A few months ago, we had lunch with other directors in Frankfurt. 

00:00:55.367 --> 00:01:03.467
 I had bad breath after him, so I went to the supermarket to buy chewing gum for which I paid with the club card. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.367
 The truth is that I do not recognize myself in this film. I do not remember that something like that happened. 

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:15.800
 I'm sorry, but chewing gum costs 1 euro, and 300,000 missing ... 

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:24.533
 Well you noticed, I also noticed the difference and I hired some friends ... 

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:31.200
 who have an espionage agency when it comes to movies. They analyzed the movie in slow motion. 

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:40.000
 When the cashier approaches the card to the reader, it is repeatedly moved by the reader, driving the price. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.600
 And so we had to pay a lot more than we should. 

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:51.200
 Is it possible that in a few seconds the cashier read the price of 300,000 times? 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900
 If you want, I will take it back and show it again. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.170
 But if it's true, why did not you let them? 

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:05.300
 No, what I could complain about at all is that when I went to checkout and said "bon dia" ***, she would give me this "buenos días" *** 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.970
 There are those who consider themselves Catalans, but they do not behave like that. 

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:14.970
 In the meantime, for those who love independence, like me, the law does not expect people to be sued for something like that. 

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.830
 Catalans! Zareagujcie! 

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:27.100
 You did great to Jan. 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.270
 Thanks. By the way, I did not know that I spent 5,000 euro on a ham. 

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.470
 It's not you, just me and Sala and Martín. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.800
 As I will be the President of Catalonia, remind me to guillotine you. 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.200
 Jan, guillotine has not been used for years. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.570
 So you see that this country needs me.
