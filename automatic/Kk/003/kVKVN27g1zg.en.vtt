 lose any recycling video besides 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 I leave my social networks for me 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 follow and comment everything that you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 want, let's start 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.160
 we begin by cutting out a heart of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.199
 preferably cardboard that is thick 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 about half a centimeter to give 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.449
 consistency to the keychains we're going to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 do then now what we do is 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.080
 mark where we are going to make the cuts 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.080
 to split the heart in 2 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.410
 more or less we will talk like that then 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.410
 we take the cutter and cut 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.950
 then once we have it cut 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.520
 now let's take a napkin from 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.990
 paper and we're going to chop it up and with these 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.150
 pieces of paper we are going to cover the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 two parts of the heart let's start 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.030
 covering all the edges so that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.090
 look like a solid piece then with a 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.690
 little white tail mixed with water 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.610
 equal parts we are putting the paper 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.610
 About the cardboard pieces 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.630
 do not 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.210
 If we have wrinkles, nothing happens 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 it's even much better to be able to do 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.950
 the effect that we want to do well a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.590
 Once we have finished putting the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.500
 paper and this has dried let's make it 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.110
 a hole to each of the pieces as 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.040
 what have I done in this I used to 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.580
 this my punch 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.510
 so we put it and 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.510
 we push 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.720
 and we have already seen the hole that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.830
 we need and now we're going to start 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 paint it 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.709
 we will make it red we paint it 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.620
 completely and we make sure that the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.430
 paint enter all the wrinkles that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.290
 we have left on paper we are going to paint 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 all the whole piece in front and by 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.780
 behind once this painting has 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.209
 drying we will use another color 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.830
 I'm going to take advantage of that I have this in 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.820
 Silver color then with the brush 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.820
 let's take some paint 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.010
 and I'm going to remove the excess in this 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.799
 napkin 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.799
 and I'm going to use the technique of my friend lola 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.500
 and we are passing the brush this way 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:14.460
 so that the silver paint stays on 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.460
 the wrinkles of our heart 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.490
 we do the same in all of the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.160
 heart on one side as on the other 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.650
 and ready we have it we do not need 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.560
 more paint as you see is a droplet what 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.540
 what we need can be any 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.570
 color but they do have gold plated 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.610
 much better already have heart ready 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.410
 and now we just need to add 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.800
 the chains the rings and the rings 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.610
 for keychain 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.770
 then we take a clamp 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.770
 to help us open the rings 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.110
 let's fit the chain 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.770
 and the heart or the part of the heart that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.310
 corresponds 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.310
 we close 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.540
 and on the other side we fit the ring 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.540
 for keys 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.100
 and we have the good one and we repeat the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.950
 process with the other 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.690
 and ready here we already have two keyrings he 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.810
 and her so if you want 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.720
 give a romantic detail like this 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 nice, you can do it this way 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.250
 if you liked this video 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.800
 I really like the end of the video 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.680
 I leave more tutorials recycling them 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.140
 I recommend that you click on the image to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.180
 take them directly to the tutorial and 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.520
 nothing else this is all for today I hope that 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.660
 in recycling there they liked it 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.790
 I hope you do too and 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.210
 see you in the next video until the 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.210
 next 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.380
 and the just
