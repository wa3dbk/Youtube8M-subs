00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.699
 with lego city undercover comes a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 of the exclusive wiew a title in full 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.040
 style of TT games even if for certain 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.430
 verse very different from their previous ones 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430
 works 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.810
 at this time we have a whole city 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.250
 the gta to explore done 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.250
 completely of lego bricks 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.370
 in short, we had a lot of fun 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 with lego city undercover and this is the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.030
 our normal video review not 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.280
 is afraid of emptiness but others a 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.380
 ridiculous phobia in lego city undercover 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.690
 we play the role of the chase cop 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.520
 mccain returning home after an exile 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.710
 forced only to find that the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 dangerous criminal his archenemy rex 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 flowers is free again stands 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.320
 obviously to our hero give him the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 hunting and put him behind bars 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.550
 before the city ​​is overwhelmed 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.830
 from the escalation of crime the whole 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.380
 with the typical style of lego titles by 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.780
 tt games this stared the guide the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.800
 phenomenal unrelated to tax chains 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.360
 from the tie in 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.369
 the developer enjoyed himself 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.410
 be ironic with the subject of the story 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.060
 the story behind the game is useless 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.800
 only as a glue between a mission and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.990
 the other but also and above all how 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.940
 background for a constant series of gags that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 equally exploit the parody el 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.869
 irony of a whole scenario 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.549
 composed of plastic bricks 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.229
 the result is a product that is 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.360
 proves able to entertain the most 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.979
 broad spectrum of public from the players 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.049
 more young people who will enjoy watching 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.430
 characters act in a funny way and i 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.019
 adult users who will leave 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.299
 surely go to some sound 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.610
 laughter listening to the jokes of some 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.040
 second hand or recognizing tasty 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.959
 quotes from titan ake matrix starsky e 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 hutch and many more 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.709
 developers have indulged themselves with a 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.959
 open world that winks at grand 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.070
 theft car constituted therefore woman 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.110
 metropolis of generous dimensions 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.239
 vaguely resembling san francisco 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.739
 with that clear thematic and even with 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.959
 of the peripheral areas in which 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.030
 urban planning leaves room for nature 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.010
 the main difference from the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.440
 sera and rockstar is in total absence 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.390
 of any nuance of violence 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.980
 the city itself has also been conceived 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.660
 like a real playground in the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.910
 what a pleasure to get lost in wandering 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.160
 full as of tokens I read from 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.350
 collect secret bonuses to discover e 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.340
 minigames to activate 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.079
 it is a form of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.610
 almost childish entertainment that 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.410
 however it works great despite 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.060
 the game does not offer rewards e 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.280
 particularly appealing to i 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 the most careful collectors the tokens 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.090
 I read only serve to unlock 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.510
 new skins to apply to the protagonist 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.580
 or to buy a 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.769
 furniture you can call in any 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.420
 moment the bricks instead are spent 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.849
 to assemble the so-called super 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.349
 constructions large works made of read 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.180
 which serve a small part as 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.189
 fundamental elements to continue 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.959
 in the adventure and that give the little ones 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.250
 advantages in the exploration process 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.019
 of the scenario 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.700
 nothing to rip your hair out of 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.860
 in short, but to resist temptation 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.659
 to collect all the tokens and i 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.579
 bricks that happen to be under eye is 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.140
 practically impossible 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.730
 during the various investigations of the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.709
 the player will be the protagonist 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.599
 engaged in more limited scenarios 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.549
 compared to large city spaces 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.769
 the game then abandons itself to genres 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.049
 different peppering the levels of elements 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.790
 environmental and even puzzle platforms 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.980
 fighting with bare hands with a system 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.019
 of counter inspired by that of batman 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.370
 arkham city an assist to the variety 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.379
 then comes from the incredible qualities 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.209
 transforms of chase capable of 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.760
 change clothes with a simple one 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.829
 one key press is eight ones 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.900
 each available with their own abilities 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.790
 here therefore that in the standard uniform from 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.889
 policeman chase is able to read 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.079
 clues with his scanner and to use 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.609
 a grappling gun wearing the clothes of 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.410
 a miner can destroy rock a 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.870
 pickaxe strokes and use the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.910
 dynamite while holding her as a thief 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.799
 allows him to force locks ed 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.120
 open safes 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.949
 a choice that leads us to 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.930
 always replay whole sections if 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.389
 obviously we want to get 100 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.949
 percent thanks to new costumes lo 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.620
 sbirro this is our field from 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.780
 basket raise your heels if you don't want to finish 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.250
 crushed and not bad friend you are 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.740
 that you can do with words 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.720
 from an exquisite point of view 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.729
 visual lego city undercover defends itself 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.740
 showing off well-groomed scenarios i 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.360
 rich in capable destructible elements 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.280
 to even give members hits 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.139
 an eye on long distances with 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.599
 the only flaw of some occasional 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.760
 framerate hiccups in stylistically 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.620
 then the game is a real treat and it is 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.570
 difficult not to smile looking at the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.639
 look of the various characters and some of the 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.229
 their animations so many good qualities that 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.240
 unfortunately do not justify the very slow 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.639
 loads that affect the game 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.840
 particularly tedious in passing by 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.310
 one mission to another 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.310
 they are no longer fit as they used to be 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.000
 lego city ​​undercover proves to be a 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.010
 enjoyable title balanced in his 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.780
 various components rich in content e 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.730
 capable of tearing more than a few 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.100
 laughter to those who appreciate the typical humor 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.510
 of tt games productions 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.100
 certainly not a game 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.080
 suitable for those looking for challenges 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.940
 particularly intense and to be honest 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.830
 the absence of rewards really 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.930
 enticing and a multiplayer mode 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.430
 could turn the nose up at 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.830
 loyal to the franchise 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.600
 however the kind of light fun 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.700
 and carefree that the game is capable of 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.620
 giving away is the closest thing there is 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.020
 the pleasure of making buildings 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.910
 with colored bricks and this for 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.800
 a product I read is certainly a nice one 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.540
 result 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.510
 seems to be making signals to the 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.770
 clean believe that this is enough for 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.080
 stop me friend is the via boccaccio a 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.900
 moment a policeman is finally 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.300
 thrown into the fray pursuit gesture 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.490
 it will certainly end the rest are
