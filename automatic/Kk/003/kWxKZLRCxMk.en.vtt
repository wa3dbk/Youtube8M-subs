00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.350
 back for all my videos is that you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 they're going to love the tweets because I 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 I'm very selective for this and that you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'm going to show you the truque today if I'm going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.210
 show today is called youtube but and as 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 his name says we are going to give him a pro 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 the native youtube app I have the last 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.640
 update so it's going to work for you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 wonder you do not have to download 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.539
 previous versions this tweet is not going 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.239
 to allow downloading videos but if you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.630
 is going to give more help but let's 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.080
 put it like that 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.000
 what is going to serve you look for example to 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.820
 when looking for some video I do not know if 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.400
 it happened to you that you press by accident 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.710
 what is the key to search for you the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 I do not think you use it, I do not think 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.970
 use most people do not use it and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.860
 with that it will be deactivated for example 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.510
 is that I'm touching it and it's not going to 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.190
 redirect to what is the search for 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.040
 voice and will not trace when searching 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.110
 my video also that another function has 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 has a function called music and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.010
 in this what you've been used to 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.110
 it's happened to you that you're listening 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.540
 music and then to youtube and it stops 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.880
 good with that tweet your music is not going to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 stop until you start to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.830
 play a video that's very functional 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.270
 because you are mostly inspired 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.850
 with a song between that youtube to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.430
 look for another one and then it's not going to stop you 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.759
 good song that you have the most is going to 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.800
 eliminate the advertising of what stuart 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.330
 of youtube for example when you enter 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880
 some video is not bothering the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.410
 advertising if youtube already increased its 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.840
 advertising appear to you right now 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.789
 absolutely all the videos before you 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.960
 could save if you entered a list of 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.110
 reproduction in the sun you thought 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.840
 once but now it's not good anymore it's not going 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.640
 to give is not going to give you publicity 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.490
 be able to choose your quality when you're in 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.319
 3g since sometimes because you have 4g the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.930
 quality because of the 910 you're going to 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.660
 to be able to decide by default music and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 stock said no chrome so that it's going to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.340
 serve the functionality of inoxcrom the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.290
 non- chrome functionality serves to make 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.660
 if you have what is installed on 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.750
 google chrome I do not network you and you do not 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.880
 redirect to google chrome and I'll 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.670
 send for safari and depending will be 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.310
 your tastes you will be able to select 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.800
 well the isem voiceage is the one that already 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.019
 I said wakeboard so that it will serve us 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.580
 just to give us white keyboard you know 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 that is under your use and as you want 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 audio background what is this use for? 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.820
 function as its name says and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 probably already have images is that 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.080
 when you get to reproduce some 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.910
 video on youtube can leave you 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.010
 application without any problem is not going 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.330
 to stop like this if you're listening to a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.980
 song and you have to answer some 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.660
 message you do not have to wait for 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.730
 finish the video or interrupt it 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.300
 you just go out when you're your 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.580
 messages you can return the video 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.770
 without any problem, you liked the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.330
 clip I'll show you how to download it 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.760
 to download it we are simply going to 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.620
 have to enter cydia bottom 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.710
 right where the lupita appears 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.860
 put search and you are going to write youtube 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.810
 but once you do this is on the network 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.480
 power big box is a totally tweet 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.580
 free and the truth weighs nothing 162 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
 kilobytes so you 're not going to have 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.570
 no problem and it will not encourage you 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.850
 device top right where I 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.670
 seems to simply change the time 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.050
 I would have installed and ready 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.760
 I hope you liked the tweet what 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.470

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.630

 that you can solve it 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.150
