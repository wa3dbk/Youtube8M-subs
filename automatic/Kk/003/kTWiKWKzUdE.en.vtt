ok this is the lineman p overview and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.309 
ok this is the lineman p overview and
here<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.740> review<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.120> riddle<00:00:06.480> 360

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
here we have a review on the riddle 360

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.759 
here we have a review on the riddle 360
a<00:00:08.120> new<00:00:09.120> helmet<00:00:09.330> from<00:00:09.900> Radel<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.410> their<00:00:10.559> top

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
a new helmet from Radel it's their top

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.520 
a new helmet from Radel it's their top
line<00:00:11.099> helmet<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.599> thing<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> second

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
line helmet so this thing in the second

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
line helmet so this thing in the second
top<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.799> line<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> speed<00:00:14.660> still<00:00:15.660> has

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
top of the line is the speed still has

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.870 
top of the line is the speed still has
the<00:00:15.960> over<00:00:16.289> liner<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> speed

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the over liner like you see in the speed

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
the over liner like you see in the speed
except<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.900> says<00:00:19.080> 360<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.100> you

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
except it just says 360 I know if you

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
except it just says 360 I know if you
can<00:00:20.340> read<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.020> upside<00:00:22.320> down

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
can read that it's kind of upside down

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
can read that it's kind of upside down
not<00:00:22.710> very<00:00:22.890> clear<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.720> there<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.619> can

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
not very clear but there we go you can

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.240 
not very clear but there we go you can
read<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.369> says<00:00:26.609> 360<00:00:27.210> inside<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> speed

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
read that that says 360 inside the speed

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.470 
read that that says 360 inside the speed
the<00:00:29.250> other<00:00:29.400> difference<00:00:29.609> between<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> speed

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the other difference between the speed

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.790 
the other difference between the speed
and<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.290> face<00:00:34.290> mask<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and this is it has the face mask that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400 
and this is it has the face mask that
actually<00:00:35.180> compresses<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.570> hits<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
actually compresses from hits to the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.020 
actually compresses from hits to the
face<00:00:38.149> also<00:00:39.149> face<00:00:39.450> masks<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.050> different<00:00:41.030> what

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
face also face masks are different what

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
face also face masks are different what
and<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.960> 360<00:00:43.860> s<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.040> says

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
and I like about the 360 s all says

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970 
and I like about the 360 s all says
lightweight<00:00:44.820> taste<00:00:45.059> mask<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:46.079> takes<00:00:46.710> down

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
lightweight taste mask which takes down

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.760 
lightweight taste mask which takes down
the<00:00:47.190> overall<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.000> helmet<00:00:48.300> um<00:00:48.770> I've

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the overall way to your helmet um I've

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.549 
the overall way to your helmet um I've
seen<00:00:50.219> people<00:00:50.399> say<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> actually

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
seen people say that you can actually

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
seen people say that you can actually
pick<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> helmet<00:00:53.550> by<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> buttons<00:00:54.090> but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pick up this helmet by the buttons but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.170 
pick up this helmet by the buttons but
as<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.960> no<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
as you can see no way that could be just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
as you can see no way that could be just
because<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.539> an<00:00:57.629> XL<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.649> makes<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
because it's an XL which makes it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
because it's an XL which makes it
heavier<00:00:59.340> but<00:01:00.199> that's<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:02.120> there's<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> back

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
heavier but that's that there's the back

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
heavier but that's that there's the back
it<00:01:03.780> doesn't<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.290> keep<00:01:04.949> fig<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it doesn't actually keep fig look at the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
it doesn't actually keep fig look at the
speed<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.900> weird<00:01:07.530> L<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.890> comes<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
speed this weird L thing comes down to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
speed this weird L thing comes down to
there<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:09.960> doesn't<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.990> 360<00:01:12.990> um<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
there and there doesn't for the 360 um I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
there and there doesn't for the 360 um I
like<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.640> /<00:01:15.000> liner<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.900> take

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like the / liner you can actually take

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.620 
like the / liner you can actually take
it<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.290> wash<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.299> forget

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it out and wash it because if you forget

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.230 
it out and wash it because if you forget
to<00:01:18.900> open<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> bag<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.310> you're

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to open up a bag or something you're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
to open up a bag or something you're
really<00:01:21.270> tired<00:01:21.869> after<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.290> practice<00:01:22.700> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
really tired after a practice your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
really tired after a practice your
helmet<00:01:24.030> does<00:01:24.180> start<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> stink<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.830> can

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
helmet does start to stink and you can

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.090 
helmet does start to stink and you can
just<00:01:26.130> take<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.580> over<00:01:27.090> liner<00:01:27.270> wash<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
just take out the over liner wash that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
just take out the over liner wash that
personally<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> wash<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.430> by<00:01:29.670> hand<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.180> don't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
personally I wash it by hand I don't

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.780 
personally I wash it by hand I don't
know<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.840> it'll<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.549> washing<00:01:32.549> machine

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
know if it'll work in a washing machine

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.109 
know if it'll work in a washing machine
personally<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.630> wouldn't<00:01:33.810> test<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
personally I wouldn't test it but you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
personally I wouldn't test it but you
can<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.509> check<00:01:36.780> riddles<00:01:37.170> website<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
can probably check riddles website and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.620 
can probably check riddles website and
see<00:01:38.150> what<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.420> says<00:01:41.390> um<00:01:43.220> let<00:01:44.220> me<00:01:44.250> see

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
what else is there uh yeah then you just

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
what else is there uh yeah then you just
wipe<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> inside<00:01:48.479> after<00:01:49.409> you've<00:01:49.530> taken

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
wipe down the inside after you've taken

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.410 
wipe down the inside after you've taken
that<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:51.829> it's<00:01:52.829> made<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.939> terms<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that out it's made in terms of the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.530 
that out it's made in terms of the
padding<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.170> has<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.270> called

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
padding it has these this thing called

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
padding it has these this thing called
the<00:01:57.659> conduct<00:01:58.170> concussion<00:01:58.920> reduction

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the conduct concussion reduction

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
the conduct concussion reduction
technology<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.990> made<00:02:01.229> by<00:02:01.880> Radel<00:02:02.930> it's<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
technology that's made by Radel it's a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.350 
technology that's made by Radel it's a
foam<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.850> their<00:02:06.180> old

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
foam that's it so it's like their old

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.800 
foam that's it so it's like their old
phone<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.799> better<00:02:07.890> um<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.270> takes<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
phone but it's better um it takes the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.130 
phone but it's better um it takes the
impact<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.489> doesn't<00:02:11.489> decay<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.819> easily

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
impact more doesn't decay as easily

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.840 
impact more doesn't decay as easily
um<00:02:14.150> yeah<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.830> also<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.220> cone<00:02:17.520> shape

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
um yeah and in they also have cone shape

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.610 
um yeah and in they also have cone shape
here<00:02:18.500> cone-shaped<00:02:19.500> material<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:21.620> they're

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here cone-shaped material like they're

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.510 
here cone-shaped material like they're
not<00:02:22.740> cone<00:02:22.950> sariah<00:02:23.510> hexagonal<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:26.310> been

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
not cone sariah hexagonal and it's been

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.190 
not cone sariah hexagonal and it's been
found<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.270> hexagons<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
found that the hexagons are one of the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.540 
found that the hexagons are one of the
best<00:02:28.470> shapes<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:29.600> absorbing<00:02:30.600> impact<00:02:31.550> like

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
best shapes for absorbing impact like

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.290 
best shapes for absorbing impact like
thats<00:02:33.450> part<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> reason<00:02:34.850> beehives<00:02:35.850> are

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
thats part of the reason beehives are

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.130 
thats part of the reason beehives are
all<00:02:36.690> made<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.650> hexagons<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> sturdy

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
all made a little hexagons it's a sturdy

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
all made a little hexagons it's a sturdy
shape<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.900> um<00:02:42.900> oh<00:02:43.170> yeah<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.970> back

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
shape so um oh yeah this in the back

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.850 
shape so um oh yeah this in the back
what<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:46.290> cradles<00:02:46.709> your

what I like is it actually cradles your
head<00:02:47.060> unlike<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.390> speed<00:02:48.780> we're<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.320> pushes

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
head unlike the speed we're just pushes

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.650 
head unlike the speed we're just pushes

pink up but Helmuth large is I have a
big<00:03:27.360> chin<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> large<00:03:28.140> actually<00:03:28.470> fits<00:03:28.680> my

big chin so the large actually fits my
chin<00:03:29.070> better<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> problem<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.630> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
chin better but the problem is because I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.770 
chin better but the problem is because I
don't<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.820> protruding<00:03:32.820> chin<00:03:33.090> it

don't have a really protruding chin it
actually<00:03:34.320> starts<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.110> back<00:03:37.290> here

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
actually starts to get in the back here

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.740 
actually starts to get in the back here
and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:37.950> every<00:03:38.700> time<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.060> get<00:03:39.180> hit<00:03:39.420> because

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and then every time you get hit because

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.050 
and then every time you get hit because
the<00:03:40.680> pressure<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.400> being<00:03:41.549> hit<00:03:41.760> into<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
the pressure is just being hit into the
