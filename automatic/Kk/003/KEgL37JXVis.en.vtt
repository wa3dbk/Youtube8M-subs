place<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> which<00:00:36.180> i<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> pretty

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
place for it which i think is a pretty

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.860 
place for it which i think is a pretty
pretty<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.680> idea<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> scale<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.450> also

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pretty good idea of the scale is also

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.150 
pretty good idea of the scale is also
just<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.100> pretty

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
just a little bit off but it's pretty

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540 
just a little bit off but it's pretty
pretty<00:00:41.700> awesome<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:43.010> think<00:00:44.010> you'd<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.280> well
