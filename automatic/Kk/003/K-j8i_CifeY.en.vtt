looking to the east but here you can see

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.049 
looking to the east but here you can see
the<00:00:12.530> funnel<00:00:12.889> cloud<00:00:13.100> as<00:00:13.309> it<00:00:13.459> starts<00:00:13.760> to<00:00:13.820> come

out of that cloud layer there and the
Sun<00:00:18.530> tonight<00:00:18.800> was<00:00:19.190> just<00:00:19.220> right<00:00:19.789> because<00:00:20.060> it

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
Sun tonight was just right because it

there<00:00:32.629> as<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.649> tornado<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.670> attempting<00:00:35.480> to

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
there as the tornado is attempting to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.450 
there as the tornado is attempting to
form<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.020> am<00:00:36.110> told<00:00:36.350> if<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:36.680> look<00:00:36.860> very

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
form and I am told if we look very

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.860 
form and I am told if we look very
closely<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.180> don't<00:00:38.360> know<00:00:38.480> at<00:00:38.630> what<00:00:38.840> point

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
closely and I don't know at what point

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.080 
closely and I don't know at what point
we're<00:00:39.590> going<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:39.950> see<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.310> but<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:40.730> can<00:00:40.880> see

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
we're going to see it but you can see

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.229 
we're going to see it but you can see
debris<00:00:41.270> coming<00:00:42.260> up<00:00:42.560> in<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:42.980> cloud<00:00:43.310> from<00:00:43.970> the

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
debris coming up in that cloud from the

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.750 
debris coming up in that cloud from the
ground<00:00:44.660> I'm<00:00:45.470> looking<00:00:45.829> at<00:00:45.920> this<00:00:46.040> video<00:00:46.340> for<00:00:46.640> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
ground I'm looking at this video for the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.340 
ground I'm looking at this video for the
say<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.329> same<00:00:47.510> time<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:47.930> you're<00:00:48.110> seeing

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
say at the same time that you're seeing

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.990 
say at the same time that you're seeing
it<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.710> don't<00:00:48.980> know<00:00:49.130> it<00:00:49.250> what<00:00:49.460> exactly<00:00:49.850> what

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
it so I don't know it what exactly what

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.150 
it so I don't know it what exactly what
point<00:00:50.270> that<00:00:50.420> occurs<00:00:50.750> but<00:00:51.530> I'm<00:00:51.649> told<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.040> if

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
point that occurs but I'm told that if

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.130 
point that occurs but I'm told that if
we<00:00:52.280> look<00:00:52.430> very<00:00:52.790> close<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.600> there<00:00:53.810> you<00:00:53.930> can<00:00:53.960> see

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
we look very close and there you can see

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.639 
we look very close and there you can see
it<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.670> debris<00:00:56.000> starting<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.690> come<00:00:56.840> up<00:00:56.870> dave

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
it the debris starting to come up dave

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.200 
it the debris starting to come up dave
has<00:00:57.829> made<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.160> point<00:00:58.370> earlier<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:58.940> because

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
has made that point earlier just because

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.150 
has made that point earlier just because
you<00:00:59.360> don't<00:00:59.480> see<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.840> base<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.920> tornado

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
you don't see the base the tornado

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.889 
you don't see the base the tornado
formed<00:01:01.670> all<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.059> way<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.420> ground<00:01:02.600> doesn't

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
formed all the way to the ground doesn't

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.259 
formed all the way to the ground doesn't
mean<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.230> isn't<00:01:03.380> there<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:04.369> is<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.939> proof<00:01:05.119> of

that it was absolutely right on that you

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
this particular video we are probably

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870 
this particular video we are probably
looking<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.750> little<00:01:35.960> bit<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.650> east<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.280> to

looking a little bit to the east and to
the<00:01:37.909> south<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.659> am<00:01:39.020> guessing<00:01:39.290> at<00:01:40.070> this<00:01:40.280> point

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.060 
the south I am guessing at this point
this<00:01:40.760> may<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.299> been<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.780> tornado<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.770> did

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
this may have been the tornado that did

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.590 
this may have been the tornado that did
the<00:01:43.159> damage<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.850> Richmond<00:01:44.210> gordmans
