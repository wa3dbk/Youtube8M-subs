back to the controls yes you've got the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
back to the controls yes you've got the
power<00:03:10.530> unbutton<00:03:11.070> there<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.580> then<00:03:12.150> you've<00:03:12.270> got

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
power unbutton there and then you've got

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.600 
power unbutton there and then you've got
your<00:03:12.450> volume<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> audio<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.100> this

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
your volume of the audio there on this

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.340 
your volume of the audio there on this
side<00:03:14.820> you've<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.060> either<00:03:15.360> too<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> turn<00:03:16.170> on

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
side you've got either too and turn on

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.900 
side you've got either too and turn on
or<00:03:16.530> turn<00:03:16.560> off<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.070> microphone<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
or turn off the microphone and then the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.610 
or turn off the microphone and then the
actual<00:03:18.030> volume<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.990> microphone<00:03:19.350> itself

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
actual volume of the microphone itself

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.200 
actual volume of the microphone itself
so<00:03:20.310> there's<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.520> lot<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.670> customizable

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
so there's a lot of customizable

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.970 
so there's a lot of customizable
controls<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.230> all<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.740> very

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
controls and it's all there you very

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.820 
controls and it's all there you very
quickly<00:03:23.160> learn<00:03:23.580> where<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> power<00:03:24.210> button<00:03:24.390> is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
quickly learn where the power button is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.410 
quickly learn where the power button is
and<00:03:25.830> how<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.280> change<00:03:26.550> volumes<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.150> find<00:03:27.300> that

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
and how to change volumes to find that

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.870 
and how to change volumes to find that
it's<00:03:27.570> really<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.110> simple<00:03:28.140> now<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.640> could

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it's really really simple now you could

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.340 
it's really really simple now you could
say<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.090> these<00:03:30.300> are<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> bit<00:03:30.630> bulky<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.140> mean

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
say that these are a bit bulky I mean

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.660 
say that these are a bit bulky I mean
they're<00:03:31.800> obviously<00:03:32.100> not<00:03:32.190> something<00:03:32.550> you

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
they're obviously not something you

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.280 
they're obviously not something you
carry<00:03:32.940> around<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.270> your<00:03:33.330> pocket<00:03:33.570> conveys<00:03:34.080> like

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it is sort of a trade-off you do get a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.910 
it is sort of a trade-off you do get a
very<00:03:38.490> cushion<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.030> very<00:03:39.210> comfy<00:03:39.870> use<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.740> these

love about these headphones actually is

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.200 
love about these headphones actually is
its<00:04:01.320> versatility<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.820> way<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
its versatility and the way that the

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.540 
its versatility and the way that the
receiver<00:04:03.540> works<00:04:03.810> if<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:04.800> is

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
receiver works if you can see on here is

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.700 
receiver works if you can see on here is
as<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.060> said<00:04:06.120> earlier<00:04:06.270> you<00:04:06.600> can<00:04:06.750> plug<00:04:06.900> any<00:04:07.080> 3.5

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
as I said earlier you can plug any 3.5

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.590 
as I said earlier you can plug any 3.5
millimeter<00:04:08.010> source<00:04:08.490> into<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.880> back<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
millimeter source into the back of the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.750 
millimeter source into the back of the
transmitter<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:11.190> comes<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.580> cable

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
transmitter so it comes with a cable

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.220 
transmitter so it comes with a cable
here<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.330> red<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.630> white<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.080> can

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
here for the red and white so you can

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.800 
here for the red and white so you can
plug<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.440> into<00:04:13.770> your<00:04:14.070> xbox<00:04:14.430> 360<00:04:14.850> audio<00:04:15.150> but

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
plug that into your xbox 360 audio but

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.880 
plug that into your xbox 360 audio but
what<00:04:15.930> I've<00:04:16.020> love<00:04:16.200> about<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.620> I've<00:04:16.709> also

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
what I've love about it is I've also

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.349 
what I've love about it is I've also
used<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.190> for<00:04:17.220> other<00:04:17.430> things<00:04:17.670> I've<00:04:17.970> just

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

out out jack into the back of the
transmitter<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.560> there<00:04:25.680> we<00:04:25.740> go<00:04:25.860> i<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.130> walk

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
transmitter and there we go i can walk

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.480
