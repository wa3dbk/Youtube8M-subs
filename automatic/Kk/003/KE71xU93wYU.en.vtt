 Personal wait a minute is to have a business that had 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.049
 a very easy warning is these songs do not 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.350
 can be in mp3 format because 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.239
 The neighborhood is strong it does not spin mp3's 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.239
 I was there saying they did not 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.890
 wheel they only accept two formats and I 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.450
 I tried with another format then did not give 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.569
 I was able to put in that format that is 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.269
 to seek to inform you 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.690

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.410
 that the wv if it has it if it had not 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.030
 have wct convert with a program I 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.889
 I'll show you how I become. 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.139

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.820

 To you, how do you convert guys? 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:39.039
 a program called a fumetti factor that is 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.169
 one is one it converts practically video 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.320
 or a lot is a very good program 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.449

 even though I had to decide because 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.020

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.310

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.860
