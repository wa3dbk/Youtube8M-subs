00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
kilometer so it depends what you're

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.729

looking<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.380> say<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:44.590> quite

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
looking for but I have to say it's quite

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.620 
looking for but I have to say it's quite

titanium trim with lots of kit that's
$15.99<00:03:52.720> 5<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.650> puts<00:03:53.830> it<00:03:53.980> around<00:03:54.610> or<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:54.940> a

$15.99 5 so it puts it around or on a

the<00:04:06.050> car<00:04:06.230> we<00:04:06.380> had<00:04:06.560> driving<00:04:07.010> here<00:04:07.160> had<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.430> be

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
the car we had driving here had to be

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.890 
the car we had driving here had to be
shipped<00:04:07.760> all<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:07.940> way<00:04:08.120> from<00:04:08.300> India<00:04:08.630> so<00:04:08.660> it's

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
shipped all the way from India so it's

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.420 
shipped all the way from India so it's
actually<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.290> pre-production<00:04:09.740> prototype

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
actually a pre-production prototype

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.949 
actually a pre-production prototype
which<00:04:10.640> means<00:04:10.850> we<00:04:10.940> don't<00:04:11.090> get<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.360> totally

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
which means we don't get a totally

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.170 
which means we don't get a totally

plastics that is kind of a mixed bag
really<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.050> means<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.710> major<00:04:24.889> touch

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
really it means that the major touch

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.350 
really it means that the major touch
points<00:04:25.490> like<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.669> gear<00:04:25.880> lever<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
robust and solidly built but as you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.430 
robust and solidly built but as you
probably<00:04:30.169> hear<00:04:31.060> there's<00:04:32.060> plenty<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.720> hard<00:04:33.139> and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
probably hear there's plenty of hard and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.140 
probably hear there's plenty of hard and
scratchy<00:04:33.770> plastics<00:04:34.400> in<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.060> can

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
scratchy plastics in here and you can

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.909 
scratchy plastics in here and you can
probably<00:04:35.330> play<00:04:35.600> sort<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.139> drum<00:04:36.350> solo<00:04:36.770> by

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
probably play sort of drum solo by

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.230 
probably play sort of drum solo by
touching<00:04:37.160> all<00:04:37.370> these<00:04:37.490> different<00:04:37.820> surfaces

touching all these different surfaces

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.210 
touching all these different surfaces
they<00:04:38.750> don't<00:04:38.960> match<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:39.350> that<00:04:39.380> well<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.010> have

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
they don't match up that well and I have

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.710 
they don't match up that well and I have
to<00:04:40.250> say<00:04:40.550> they<00:04:40.730> don't<00:04:40.910> give<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> particularly

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
to say they don't give a particularly

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480 
to say they don't give a particularly

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
good impression of perceived build

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
good impression of perceived build
quality<00:04:43.669> maybe<00:04:44.540> that'll<00:04:44.840> change<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.230> the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
quality maybe that'll change with the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.659 
quality maybe that'll change with the
finished<00:04:45.590> cars<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.070> at<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.250> moment<00:04:46.400> this

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
finished cars but at the moment this

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.520 
finished cars but at the moment this
feels<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.970> little<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.419> step<00:04:47.720> behind<00:04:47.960> cars

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
feels a little bit of a step behind cars

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.890 
feels a little bit of a step behind cars
like<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.710> Peugeot<00:04:49.010> 2008<00:04:49.610> certainly<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.330> to

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
like the Peugeot 2008 certainly and to

some extent the Renault Captur as well
space<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.210> here<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.660> really<00:04:53.960> generous<00:04:54.470> though

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
space in here is really generous though

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.320 
space in here is really generous though
and<00:04:54.890> for<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.070> compact<00:04:55.550> car<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.940> could<00:04:56.060> easily

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
and for a compact car you could easily

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.540 
and for a compact car you could easily

Fiesta getting three across the back
might<00:05:02.330> be<00:05:02.479> a<00:05:02.510> bit<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.810> squeeze<00:05:03.169> though<00:05:03.200> and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
might be a bit of a squeeze though and

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.020 
might be a bit of a squeeze though and
there's<00:05:03.710> not<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> huge<00:05:04.190> amount<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.460> flexibility

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
there's not a huge amount of flexibility

there's not a huge amount of flexibility
when<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.210> comes<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.540> swapping<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:05.960> seats

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
when it comes to swapping the seats

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.629 
when it comes to swapping the seats
around<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.620> can't<00:05:06.830> slide<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.280> rear<00:05:07.370> bench

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639

around you can't slide the rear bench
back<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.030> forwards<00:05:08.419> for<00:05:08.570> instance<00:05:08.900> having

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
back and forwards for instance having

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.840 
back and forwards for instance having
said<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.590> though<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.160> Headroom<00:05:10.490> isn't

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
said that though the Headroom isn't

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.159 
said that though the Headroom isn't
really<00:05:11.150> decent<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.720> only<00:05:11.870> thing<00:05:12.080> you

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
really decent and the only thing you

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.930 
really decent and the only thing you
will<00:05:12.320> notice<00:05:12.500> is<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.130> quite<00:05:13.400> narrow<00:05:13.640> up

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
will notice is that it's quite narrow up

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.250 
will notice is that it's quite narrow up
here<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.390> feel<00:05:14.600> quite<00:05:14.780> close<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.140> your

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
here so you feel quite close to your

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.510 
here so you feel quite close to your
passenger<00:05:15.710> but<00:05:16.160> other<00:05:16.280> than<00:05:16.460> that

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
passenger but other than that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.219 
passenger but other than that
practicality<00:05:17.300> is<00:05:17.450> certainly<00:05:17.780> on<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.960> side<00:05:18.200> of

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
practicality is certainly on the side of

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.460 
practicality is certainly on the side of
the<00:05:18.440> eco<00:05:18.620> sport

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.680 

so<00:05:23.470> does<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.400> new<00:05:24.550> eco<00:05:24.880> sport<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.419> what<00:05:25.600> it

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
so does the new eco sport have what it

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.890 
so does the new eco sport have what it
takes<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.169> be<00:05:26.259> a<00:05:26.289> real<00:05:26.350> cash<00:05:26.979> cow<00:05:27.280> for<00:05:27.310> Ford

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
takes to be a real cash cow for Ford

part of that strategy there are some

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.469
