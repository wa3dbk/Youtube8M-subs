00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.439
 Hello everyone craves and the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.230
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.510
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.460
 this trick serves so that it no longer does 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 you have to ask for so many spice cars 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.500
 touch the car of the snow car no 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.449
 I know I do not know how much hot night is anymore 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.310
 you need to ask for nothing because in 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.920
 this trick I will show you how 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.770
 get all the rare cars that 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.289
 exist for the multiplayer mode of 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.480
 grand theft auto 5 the trick is pretty 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.309
 complicated to do and we can do it from 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.470
 two ways we can get the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.470
 cars we put for ourselves worth 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.329
 looking at the location of that car in 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.460
 here in the campaign, you should do it from 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.200
 the entire campaign so the first thing that 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.780
 we will have to do is enter a 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.690
 departure of the campaign that we have done 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.100
 I recommend that you take more than 50% 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.320
 I know the truth because I have not played 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.030
 downloaded this campaign is not mine anymore 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.410
 better I'll put it in the description if 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.230
 you want to download some or you are looking for 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.820
 for youtube some wanted to be pretty 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.129
 started and then we must 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 put us the character of michael vale 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.310
 we go to the button below and select 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.259
 well 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.399
 from the left that is the michael now 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.770
 the trick can be done in two ways 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.170
 different I recommend the second the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.820
 first would be to go to the location of 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.009
 car that you want as per 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 example I have no example because 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.520
 I do not know any but for example the space 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.140
 docker is assembled pieces so if 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 you want to assemble pieces in the campaign 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 so you already have it and everything you save 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.310
 in your garage and as stopper eyes if 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.649
 I'm lazy to do this as for example 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.360
 to me then what you can do is go to 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.340
 video that you will have in the description of 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.869
 this same video or do you know what I put here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.789
 good in big park to make it look 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.259
 that you have osa you have to go to the video 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.030
 that I leave in the description because 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.009
 I will explain how to use 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.500
 a program and change the cars that 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.759
 you have in the garage for the car that 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.619
 you want or that is a program 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.630
 that you choose the car you want 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.159
 to be put in the garage so I 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.170
 I recommend that because you can put the 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.539
 car that you want hot night you can put 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 all the cars that exist in the game 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.679
 even all-purpose airplanes 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.270
 so you go to that video that you 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.399
 I will explain then what 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.170
 you have to do to do that when 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.819
 you have seen it, you will understand 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.070
 also a little in what to explain 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.180
 now surely good then right now 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.189
 I have done the trick 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.060
 in the description that you if not what 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.010
 you want to do, do not do it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.629
 you use the car that you want 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.620
 such as he explained 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.540
 explains that we can follow 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.040
 disassembling the pieces so as 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.810
 You have seen me because it seemed to me 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.579
 below the map and that's because it has 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.590
 done the trick possibly appears and you 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.060
 make 'aces' appear below the map or 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.659
 possibly the car appears inside 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.639
 from the garage if you have done it 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.349
 assembling the pieces, it will appear where 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.939
 you have left it the last time 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.290
 but to me as I did the trick then I 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.909
 it has seemed here so now 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 Then what we have to do is 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.739
 save the space touch the car that 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.319
 you have the best that what you want 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.109
 move here to the online vale we will have to 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.790
 pass it there to the other garage of michael 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.159
 which is the one that I'm marking here 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.959
 we'll have to go there and once 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.030
 we will have to park the car 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.419
 just as I'm parking 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.919
 side and do not watch the video a lot because 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:09.409
 I already know that I am not a very good driver for 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.900
 park and everything but good when the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.819
 jce has parked as you have seen there in 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.189
 the video we will have to get a 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.489
 pretty big van because we have 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.950
 that push the car to the bottom and 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.400
 A) Yes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.950
 the valuable garage stage is therefore not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 get off when we're online like this 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.640
 that the location of that car is 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.709
 exactly where I am marking the point 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.200
 here and then we have to get a 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 once we get to that point we have to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.030
 find a van as we are 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 seeing there is this possibly does not come out 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.840
 because in many cases it does not come out 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.260
 to wait a little bit for the best 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 night appears or day depends I do not know 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.310
 why but I recommend using this 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.569
 if you try again, then leave it 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.489
 in the comments to help the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.099
 because as I say sometimes not 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.250
 this van appears and when the 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.640
 we have to go back to the house of 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.349
 michael the one in the garage this one who remembers 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.420
 that has two garages has this and the 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.590
 blue we have to go to the other one that is 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.329
 where has the door that opens 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.010
 directly since that of the blue garage 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.420
 what it does is that when we give the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.489
 right then it does not get directly into the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.959
 garage why we have to get into 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.180
 this garage in the michael el 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.979
 secondary we know here because we have 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.350
 to push the space docker or the car 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.120
 that we have until the bottom is worth when 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.430
 let's not put any more so we'll have 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.860
 to get off the car and now 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.020
 to the mobile and here we give to save 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.820
 fast so once when we keep 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.220
 the game where we want 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.949
 we'll have to give the start we're going to 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.600
 online and in the first option 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.759
 directly because we already put a 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.410
 public game with more people this what 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.630
 short because if it is not longer the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.180
 building and I do not want it to be that long and 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.090
 when we are already here in the game one 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.280
 public online game we will need a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.020
 program that I will leave in the description 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.000
 it is very important I put you here a 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.889
 annotation for people who are not me 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.050
 listening to this is me that I know well what 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.910
 what are you doing you have to use 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.190
 that program because they're going to explain 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.410
 in a cost tutorial but I know 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.030
 exactly the same for this game 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.240
 because it really does the same or is done 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.160
 the same utility and we will have to 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.900
 use the program that and when 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.180
 we use then we will first have to 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.180
 do the trick of sending the character 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.330
 of the campaign to the online after the patch 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.460
 in 1.06 and as the explained in no 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.880
 video, I'll explain now what 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.159
 we have to do is go to the start let's go 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.449
 playstation store and when we put the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.430
 warning symbol that we have 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.650
 the X to show us saying 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.759
 that we're going to go to the towers, so what 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.439
 we have to do at this moment is 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.330
 activate the net tools in the description 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.580
 I leave you how to configure it in such a way 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.889
 that produces a lot of lag and then when 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.240
 let's give the start in the net tools 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.680
 let's wait about two seconds for him to load 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.419
 and then we give the warning 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.789
 in the game when we see it to the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.800
 warning as the game will go slow 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.169
 this moment we give the start we are going to 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.180
 online quickly and here we give to 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.189
 abandon gta online has to be this 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.379
 is fast while charging the 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:07.270
 menu and it's taking us to the cloud 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.189
 I recommend that you remove the net now 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.779
 tools when we give it to leave gta 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.029
 online because if you're not going to go very 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.620
 stuck the game and then already what 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.539
 we have to do is when we appear 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.430
 here with the one of the credit cards 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.589
 we wait about five or ten seconds 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.439
 to load the cards and here you 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:25.180
 we already give the circle to cancel and not 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.099
 we buy in any card we will be 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.020
 again in the cloud and it will take us to 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.029
 campaign but in an online version here 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.080
 the player will catch us a bit, so 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.599
 what we will have to do to us 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.569
 appear we will have to give the start 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:39.879
 we go to the playstation store and in this 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.960
 time because we have to give the 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.759
 warning we give 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.979
 and here maybe it can take us 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.410
 directly to the online with the character 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.479
 of the campaign or it will take us back to the 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.330
 cards and we give the circle to 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.639
 cancel again and well then when 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.110
 let's have this possibly because we 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.800
 get it right you will have to do it again 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.810
 the trick of passing the campaign player 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.310
 to online because sometimes we stay 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.090
 caught on the play or I do not know what 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.139
 pass 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.000
 so you have to do it until you 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.150
 come out and once we are here in 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.639
 the online is worth to notice that I have 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.770
 maikel and here what we have to do 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.410
 is to enter the garage where we leave 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.330
 our car that we wanted to have the 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.370
 campaign online and see what we have 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.550
 here, our space docker 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.620
 we put and the ambulance is good in 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.690
 the van until we have here 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.910
 so that we will remain open 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.620
 garage is worth it and so directly 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.229
 we will have the car already simply what 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.570
 we would have to do is put the car 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.940
 in our garage without anyone 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.370
 destroy carefully and when you already 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.740
 put in the garage because it is already our 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.440
 and already simply what we have to 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.080
 do is go to tuning as 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.000
 what we would expose the locator and 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.000
 the insurance that is very important about 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.590
 all the insurance and that's it we already have the 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.820
 car for us and we could do 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.280
 this with all the cars that 

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.500
 we would like to the maximum that what 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.150
 They fit in the most expensive garage because they are 10 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.100
 not so good then I hope it has 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.750
