00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
doing store ports on mob which means to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
doing store ports on mob which means to
so<00:02:09.269> many<00:02:09.390> designs<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.410> look<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
so many designs the look or what the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.620 
so many designs the look or what the
characters<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.300> environment

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
characters look like in that environment

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.300 
characters look like in that environment
and<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.620> draw<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.130> that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and you have to draw it in that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.490 
and you have to draw it in that
particular<00:02:14.670> style<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.870> those<00:02:16.260> are<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> three

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
particular style so those are the three

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.620 
particular style so those are the three
differences<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.700> fill<00:02:17.970> me<00:02:18.060> again<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.450> can

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
differences and fill me again you can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.600 
differences and fill me again you can
sort<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.959> fluctuate<00:02:19.440> style<00:02:19.739> same<00:02:20.340> thing<00:02:20.519> with

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
sort of fluctuate style same thing with

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.699 
sort of fluctuate style same thing with
animation<00:02:21.150> bet<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.480> commercial<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.380> much

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
animation bet on commercial it's much

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.739 
animation bet on commercial it's much
much<00:02:22.920> tighter<00:02:23.660> when<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.780> comes<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.200> 22
