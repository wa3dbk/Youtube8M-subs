00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello to today's video tutorial I 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.640
 show you how the heart of this kind 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.910
 we will need a basecoat varnish and 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.180
 protective lacquer can say your kiddies 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.419
 I chose the company Penza black lacquer with 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.970
 fine brush i have firm panel 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.620
 black gel pen 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.410
 first we cover the nails transparent 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.059
 the basics than matthews will be bast easier 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.059
 will apply drawings 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.420
 when the varnish is dry we start to paint 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.300
 I have a black gel pen pattern 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.390
 associated with torn film or 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.800
 even with strange tights first i'm drawing 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 contour until nail 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.520
 at the base and on the tips and me a little 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.700
 thicker than tobacco 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.979
 inside the contour are these different patterns for 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 each with your fingernail just a little 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.190
 turn on the fantasy 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.260
 the main thing is that the holes that you 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.260
 pic or oval edges 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.100
 I like to do a manicure very long 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.710
 keeps it can be adjusted 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.820
 if a little oblezet and a hundred percent 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.820
 attracts attention 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.540
 those places the girl does not want him 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.540
 paint the nails on the varnish 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.490
 I'll fix the marker 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.060
 may not be entirely correct 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.960
 or mono with respect to the nails I hope 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.960
 they will fall off me 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.640
 first trying to translate the idea 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.770
 only black lacquer with a thin brush 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.990
 the length of his mouth but I am really over 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.580
 expectations and bringing was too 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.420
 transparent to me was the same contrast 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.870
 drawing pupils velcro so i have it 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.349
 used . 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.299
 covering all of his in order for him not to 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.710
 smeared when we will not apply 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.030
 top 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.260
 services but it is not necessary 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.780
 if the pattern allows it dried out there 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.410
 10 15 and gently apply a protective layer 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.300
 varnish 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.160
 but this 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.280
 chances are your baby 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.280
 will be able 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.000
 the self 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.270
 a gun to draw a picture on the right hand 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.160
 I didnâ€™t have to help deer Nicholas 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.750
 do on their own therefore 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.470
 got a little 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.470
 cool 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.560
 Now we cover with a protective varnish better in 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.560
 2 layers 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.160
 instead of this varnish can use 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.160
 any other clear varnish 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.199
 i like this 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.529
 it was not his 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.890
 I hope he
