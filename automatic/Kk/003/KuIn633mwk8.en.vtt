00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
well I think the pist factor is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
well I think the pist factor is
apparently<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.619> quite<00:01:13.950> high<00:01:14.159> enough<00:01:14.310> with

one's been guillotined that I know of in

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.800 
one's been guillotined that I know of in
probably<00:01:22.259> 150<00:01:22.890> years<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.509> war

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
probably 150 years so you have this war

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
probably 150 years so you have this war
where<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.619> they're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
where it's kind of like they're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
where it's kind of like they're
chest-to-chest<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> bumping<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> chests

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
chest-to-chest kind of bumping in chests

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
chest-to-chest kind of bumping in chests
against<00:01:29.189> each<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.090> nothing's<00:01:30.450> really

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
against each other but nothing's really

against each other but nothing's really
happening<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> we're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
happening I think this thing that we're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.310 
happening I think this thing that we're
talking<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> charging<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
talking about which is the charging of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
talking about which is the charging of
these<00:01:34.799> shuttle<00:01:35.189> companies<00:01:35.610> who<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
these shuttle companies who will then of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
these shuttle companies who will then of
course<00:01:36.689> pass<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.619> tech<00:01:38.130> companies

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
course pass it on to the tech companies

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
course pass it on to the tech companies
okay<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.600> who<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.810> afford<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> think

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.149 
okay right for who can afford it I think
it's<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> dollar<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.400> day<00:01:42.170> per<00:01:43.170> stop<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> know

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it's a dollar a day per stop do you know

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's a dollar a day per stop do you know
the<00:01:44.340> cost<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.509> haven't<00:01:45.659> been<00:01:45.810> able<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the cost because we haven't been able to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
the cost because we haven't been able to
figure<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.439> exactly<00:01:46.560> very<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:47.610> not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
figure out exactly very much they're not

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.850 
figure out exactly very much they're not
allowed<00:01:48.329> because<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.110> city<00:01:49.290> bureaucracy<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
allowed because the city bureaucracy of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.850 
allowed because the city bureaucracy of
course<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> cannot<00:01:50.549> make<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> profit<00:01:51.509> because

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
course you cannot make a profit because

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.020 
course you cannot make a profit because
government<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> government<00:01:53.610> never<00:01:53.700> makes<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
government and government never makes a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
government and government never makes a
profit<00:01:54.500> but<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.829> cost<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.369> estimated<00:01:56.549> at

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
profit but if the cost is estimated at

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
profit but if the cost is estimated at
1.5<00:01:57.540> million<00:01:57.810> dollars<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
1.5 million dollars but if you do the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.709 
1.5 million dollars but if you do the
math<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> cost<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.329> said<00:02:00.570> they

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
math on the cost that they said they

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.819 
math on the cost that they said they
were<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.200> were<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.500> companies

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
were that there were these companies

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.499 
were that there were these companies
we're<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> incur<00:02:02.369> well<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.000> gave<00:02:03.180> million

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
we're going to incur well I gave million

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
we're going to incur well I gave million
so<00:02:03.600> maybe<00:02:03.840> there's<00:02:04.170> six<00:02:04.890> six<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.310> half

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so maybe there's six six and a half

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.709 
so maybe there's six six and a half
million<00:02:05.640> dollars<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.360> somebody<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
million dollars there for somebody to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.619 
million dollars there for somebody to
play<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:08.190> income<00:02:08.819> equality<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
to go well it goes up and down and I do

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160 
to go well it goes up and down and I do
think<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.820> there's<00:02:43.120> sort<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.360> an<00:02:43.480> inexorable
