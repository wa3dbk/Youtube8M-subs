doing at this point we kind of realize

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.009 
doing at this point we kind of realize
they're<00:03:23.950> boosting<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:25.360> at<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.600> point<00:03:25.810> we're

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
they're boosting so at this point we're

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.539 
they're boosting so at this point we're
kind<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.200> looking<00:03:26.350> around<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.920> mash<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.370> we

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
kind of looking around for mash it we

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.860 
kind of looking around for mash it we
didn't<00:03:27.730> really<00:03:27.850> realize<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.269> were<00:03:28.330> over<00:03:28.630> here

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
didn't really realize we were over here

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.050 
didn't really realize we were over here
and<00:03:29.620> then<00:03:29.950> we<00:03:30.070> eventually<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.610> finding

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
and then we eventually in the finding

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.949 
and then we eventually in the finding
I'm<00:03:31.120> actually<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.420> think<00:03:31.450> at<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.750> pretty

his points I guess you could say but I'm
even<00:04:25.690> while<00:04:25.990> we're<00:04:26.139> trying<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:26.379> break<00:04:26.560> them<00:04:26.710> up

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
even while we're trying to break them up

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.529 
even while we're trying to break them up
I<00:04:27.039> mean<00:04:27.190> they're<00:04:27.310> still<00:04:27.580> focused<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.120> boosting

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
I mean they're still focused on boosting

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.439 
I mean they're still focused on boosting
that's<00:04:29.319> their<00:04:29.530> main<00:04:29.770> goal<00:04:30.039> like<00:04:30.490> they<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.240> to

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
that's their main goal like they have to

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.749 
that's their main goal like they have to
boost<00:04:31.629> these<00:04:31.870> pistol<00:04:32.199> head<00:04:32.319> shots<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:32.889> we<00:04:33.069> have

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
boost these pistol head shots so we have

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.149 
boost these pistol head shots so we have
to<00:04:33.940> get<00:04:34.030> these<00:04:34.180> guys<00:04:34.360> been<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:35.740> apparently
