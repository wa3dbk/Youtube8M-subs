00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 the funny roles 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.240

 no more cats break 8 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 I do not know what I wish for my first choice 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.879
 to it meant «one still thinks» I would have my money more 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.559

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.380
