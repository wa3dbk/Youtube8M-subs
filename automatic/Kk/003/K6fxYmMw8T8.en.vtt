it'll<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.310> keep<00:02:14.490> spewing<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.510> stuff<00:02:16.170> now

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it'll just keep spewing out stuff now

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.650 
it'll just keep spewing out stuff now
that<00:02:16.980> means<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.370> you'll<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.450> keep<00:02:18.600> your

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
that means you you'll have to keep your

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.150 
that means you you'll have to keep your
Hammond<00:02:19.050> Tory<00:02:19.230> completes<00:02:19.560> not<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Hammond Tory completes not if you have a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.570 
Hammond Tory completes not if you have a
full<00:02:20.580> chest<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.120> diamonds<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.920> amazing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
full chest of diamonds that's amazing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.400 
full chest of diamonds that's amazing
but<00:02:24.150> unlikely<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:24.960> not<00:02:25.140> gonna<00:02:25.290> be

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
but unlikely that that's not gonna be

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.810 
but unlikely that that's not gonna be
happening<00:02:25.470> anytime<00:02:26.100> soon

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
happening anytime soon

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.920 
happening anytime soon
so<00:02:27.860> yeah<00:02:31.130> yeah<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:33.480> could<00:02:33.660> set<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
so yeah yeah so you you could set a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.630 
so yeah yeah so you you could set a
little<00:02:34.290> signal<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.830> with<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> comparator<00:02:35.610> here

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
little signal up with a comparator here

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.120 
little signal up with a comparator here
and<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.780> repeater<00:02:37.380> after<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and a repeater after that and then a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.460 
and a repeater after that and then a
redstone<00:02:38.670> lamp<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.270> wanted<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.780> really

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
redstone lamp if you wanted I really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.930 
redstone lamp if you wanted I really
didn't<00:02:40.650> find<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.860> necessary<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.580> I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
didn't find that necessary because I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.100 
didn't find that necessary because I
would<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.420> everybody<00:02:42.540> would<00:02:42.870> check<00:02:43.080> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
would think everybody would check that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.580 
would think everybody would check that
every<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.560> often<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:46.080> what<00:02:46.230> you're<00:02:46.320> gonna<00:02:46.410> want

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
every so often so what you're gonna want

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.720 
every so often so what you're gonna want
to<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.830> you're<00:02:46.920> gonna<00:02:46.980> want<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> put<00:02:47.490> this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
to do is you're gonna want to put this

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
to do is you're gonna want to put this
exact<00:02:48.240> amount<00:02:48.600> 18<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.890> whatever<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
exact amount 18 of whatever it is and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.780 
exact amount 18 of whatever it is and
then<00:02:52.290> four<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.490> your<00:02:54.350> key<00:02:55.350> items<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:56.760> is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
then four of your key items which is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.170 
then four of your key items which is
these<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:58.050> then<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.400> put<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> comparator

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
these and then you can put a comparator

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.250 
these and then you can put a comparator
right<00:03:00.330> there<00:03:00.570> make<00:03:01.050> sure<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.770> torch<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.520> up

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
right there make sure the torch is up

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.690 
right there make sure the torch is up
wait<00:03:04.290> doesn't<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.130> feel<00:03:05.270> yeah<00:03:06.830> yeah<00:03:07.830> has<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.640> be

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
wait doesn't it feel yeah yeah has to be

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.400 
wait doesn't it feel yeah yeah has to be
up<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.660> have<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.900> write<00:03:10.050> clothes<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
up but you have to write clothes that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.660 
up but you have to write clothes that
are<00:03:10.500> compared<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.920> make<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> torch<00:03:11.400> come<00:03:11.550> up

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
are compared to make the torch come up

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.800 
are compared to make the torch come up
and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.890> lock<00:03:13.890> their<00:03:14.190> wrists<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.880> there<00:03:15.120> rest

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and then lock their wrists on there rest

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.710 
and then lock their wrists on there rest
it<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:15.930> top<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.350> with<00:03:16.500> torch<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.720> then

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
it on top of that with torch and then

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.680 
it on top of that with torch and then
that'll<00:03:19.350> allow<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.510> certain

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that'll allow if you have a certain

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.130 
that'll allow if you have a certain
amount<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.959> diamond<00:03:22.260> say<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> put<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:24.450> two<00:03:24.959> in

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
amount of diamond say I put the two in

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.490 
amount of diamond say I put the two in
there<00:03:25.320> it'll<00:03:26.130> do<00:03:26.640> 19<00:03:27.180> what<00:03:27.870> redstone<00:03:28.320> go

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
there it'll do 19 what redstone go

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
there it'll do 19 what redstone go
through<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.520> then<00:03:29.670> it'll<00:03:30.030> say<00:03:30.209> oh<00:03:30.240> I<00:03:30.390> stuck

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
through and then it'll say oh I stuck

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.720 
through and then it'll say oh I stuck
one<00:03:30.990> more<00:03:31.230> sort<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.530> let<00:03:31.950> more<00:03:32.310> items<00:03:32.580> go

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
one more sort of let more items go

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
one more sort of let more items go
through<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.030> first<00:03:33.360> thing<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.630> out<00:03:33.810> it'll

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
through but first thing is out it'll

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.530 
through but first thing is out it'll
stop<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.740> then<00:03:35.640> you'll<00:03:35.820> get<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.090> down<00:03:36.420> in

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
stop it and then you'll get that down in

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.140 
stop it and then you'll get that down in
this<00:03:36.630> chest<00:03:36.930> over<00:03:37.050> here<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:38.580> you'll

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
this chest over here and then you'll

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.080 
this chest over here and then you'll
what<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:39.750> gonna<00:03:39.870> put<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> comparator<00:03:40.709> here

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.030 

that's<00:03:45.090> supposed<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.540> up<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.040> remember

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
that's supposed to be up I remember

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.949 
that's supposed to be up I remember
correctly

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
correctly

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:56.380 
correctly
let's<00:03:48.959> make<00:03:49.140> just<00:03:49.530> double-check<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:52.400> yeah

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.690 

you're<00:03:57.390> gonna<00:03:57.570> want<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:58.830> put<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> block

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
you're gonna want and then put a block

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.010 
you're gonna want and then put a block
there<00:04:00.000> repeater<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.840> redstone<00:04:02.900> going<00:04:03.900> to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
there repeater and redstone going to

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.840 
there repeater and redstone going to
wrap<00:04:04.200> around<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:04.890> has<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> little<00:04:05.340> clock

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
wrap around so it has a little clock

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.979 
wrap around so it has a little clock
going<00:04:06.680> another<00:04:07.680> repeater<00:04:08.040> couple<00:04:08.670> droppers

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
going another repeater couple droppers

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.580 
going another repeater couple droppers
I<00:04:10.070> just<00:04:11.070> put<00:04:11.670> my<00:04:11.700> note<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.450> one<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.140> don't

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
I just put my note this one you don't

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.870 
I just put my note this one you don't
want<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.890> fill<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.160> anything<00:04:14.489> or<00:04:14.610> they<00:04:14.730> can

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
want to fill with anything or they can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.390 
want to fill with anything or they can
just<00:04:14.910> like<00:04:15.410> look<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> corner<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> and

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
just like look at the corner of it and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.820 
just like look at the corner of it and
go<00:04:17.520> down<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.880> there<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.120> grab<00:04:18.500> loads<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.709> them
