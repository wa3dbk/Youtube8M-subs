00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 welcome to video number 6 from the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 swiss trading floor we have kicked off 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.460
 on the voice it actually always busy 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 is no matter what time you arrive 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.969
 it is actually relatively quiet now 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.380
 so we use francs for a while 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 yes because he would make this a scoop 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.740
 Ferrari 488 GTB the successor to the 458 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 then you may know just like this is me 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 the entry level of ferrari what the carl 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 for Opel , this car is for Ferrari 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 but not nauseous of course 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.510
 a small knee because the previous one was 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.840
 a four and half liter v8 atmospheric 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 this is a 3.9 with double turbo turbo 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.219
 in a ferrari naturally have earlier 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 seen but more power and I can 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.570
 call the numbers fixed in exactly 3 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.789
 seconds from 0 to 100 and a top of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.809
 330 km per hour 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.809
 first boarding lakes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
 and from ferrari it is a small step 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.460
 to grains the young chinese brand that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.219
 We first came here three years ago 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.280
 saw big plans at the fair 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.140
 first drop the brand in china 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
 And then also in Europe that would be within one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 few years 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 we are now a few years further and and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 grains can still not buy in the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 showroom in europe 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.789
 gives nothing to say itself yes we 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.080
 take it easy on europe piece quite 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.539
 important but you can't just do it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.960
 just lost the moment 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.009
 because that is no guarantee of success 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.110
 we now have a bacon tie 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 they then have this city suv so it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.920
 model range is already starting to order 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 but yes you would say 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 cores now a little bit the beech 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.789
 because everything stays beautiful 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:46.709
 words no swiss car show 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.179
 complete without the village idiot 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.399
 automotive industry and that's it 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.649
 Swiss rinspeed are already holding what 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 consistent every year for years 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.940
 concept car nude that is called lookwell 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.369
 makes no sense sometimes is an underwater 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.709
 car than a car types in 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.149
 and extends and I once seen I am 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.770
 never been a whole shed full 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.899
 stand with the nonsense bumper on 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.129
 bumper this is the newest creation 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.209
 Rudy 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.580
 if you look closely then you see it is up 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.840
 basis of a bmw i3 and the special 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.640
 to this car that actually is already it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.769
 special but the theme of this car 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.840
 is that left and right you can both 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.670
 Steering the steering column is a kind of robot 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.170
 arm that goes up and down from left to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.430
 right we wheel like nobody wants 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900
 then he just goes a middle 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.730
 stand and djibouti bit like a kind 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.590
 dance for the rest on the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.730
 back seat a chewing gum ball machine yes 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.870
 fan's as we are it hits completely 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.870
 nowhere nice 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.170
 drink should you ever get stuck 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.020
 sit with you that fender 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.760
 I'll come and love you I'll call you good one 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.349
 taste and a lot of money don't always go 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
 together stronger people with a lot 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.650
 Money can sometimes be very weird and a head 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.239
 is going to be for people like that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.410
 of course a market and then you it 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.080
 people ri 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 wrappers oil site with a chromosome too 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.610

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.610
 welcome 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.489
 our previous video where we might not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.939
 very complimentful about the bmw 2 series 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.590
 but grandtour are also things that are 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.890
 what better passed if I say so 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.079
 self 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.579
 That this one has a thorough series 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.780
 have undergone a facelift and I really think so 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.780
 seriously quite a progress 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.980
 Yes 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.380
 finish video number 6 in style on the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 rear seat can give him Mercedes Maybach 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.790
 s class pool me and how do you recognize the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.890
 bombs 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.230
 four seats in the back and especially whole 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.150
 a lot of luxury because once you are a driving person 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.810
 living room well that my living room can 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.790
 I assure you 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.500
 our own king Willem-Alexander drives 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.780

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.640
 highness look a little further around you 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.800
 because I think it's just poverty 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.390
 compared to this wonderful one 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.739
