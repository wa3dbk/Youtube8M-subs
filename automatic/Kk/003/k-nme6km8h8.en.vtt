you how to make quick triangle squares

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.850 
you how to make quick triangle squares
the<00:00:08.820> benefit<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.600> this<00:00:09.719> method<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
the benefit to this method is that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740 
the benefit to this method is that
you're<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.219> cutting<00:00:11.610> triangles<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.480> begin

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you're not cutting triangles to begin

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.959 
you're not cutting triangles to begin
with<00:00:12.900> you're<00:00:13.350> starting<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:13.980> squares<00:00:14.340> you

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
with you're starting with squares you

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
with you're starting with squares you
sew<00:00:15.270> them<00:00:15.510> just<00:00:15.780> two<00:00:16.049> lines<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.440> sewing<00:00:16.860> and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
sew them just two lines of sewing and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
sew them just two lines of sewing and
then<00:00:17.430> cut<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.820> apart<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:18.930> come<00:00:19.199> out

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
then cut them apart so they come out

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.249 
then cut them apart so they come out
more<00:00:19.949> perfectly<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:21.240> easily<00:00:21.720> let<00:00:22.019> me<00:00:22.109> show

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is the wonderful tool from Vaughn's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.370 
is the wonderful tool from Vaughn's
importer<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.910> making<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.450> triangles<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
importer for making these triangles and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.580 
importer for making these triangles and
you'll<00:00:47.190> notice<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.490> on<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.760> end<00:00:48.380> there's<00:00:49.380> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
you'll notice that on one end there's a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
you'll notice that on one end there's a
corner<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.490> just<00:00:50.700> match<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
corner so you just match that up and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
corner so you just match that up and
then<00:00:51.630> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> other<00:00:51.870> end<00:00:52.320> there's<00:00:52.560> this<00:00:52.740> line

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then on the other end there's this line

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.980 
then on the other end there's this line
down<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> center<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.180> match<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.810> with<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
down the center so match that up with a

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.100 
down the center so match that up with a
point<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.560> and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:56.550> using<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.120> marking

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
point there and then using your marking

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.010 
point there and then using your marking
tool<00:00:58.550> draw<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.580> line<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.060> each<00:01:00.390> side<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.900> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
tool draw a line on each side of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.149 
tool draw a line on each side of the
tool<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.870> fonz<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.530> Porter<00:01:04.860> chalk

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
tool this is the fonz and Porter chalk

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.620 
tool this is the fonz and Porter chalk
pencil<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:05.820> using<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> white<00:01:06.420> which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
pencil and I'm using the white which

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.110 
pencil and I'm using the white which
goes<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.200> well<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.010> navy<00:01:08.220> blue<00:01:08.340> there

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
goes really well on the navy blue there

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.490 
goes really well on the navy blue there
are<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.360> colors<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.840> instance<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.440> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
are other colors for instance there's a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
are other colors for instance there's a
blue<00:01:10.740> which<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:12.060> better<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.690> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
blue which would work better on a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
blue which would work better on a
different<00:01:13.080> color<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.500> find<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
different color but I find that the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.220 
different color but I find that the
white<00:01:14.280> works<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.480> so<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> I'm

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
white works really well here so what I'm

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.140 
white works really well here so what I'm
doing<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.730> put<00:01:17.970> my

doing now is I'm just going to put my

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.560 
doing now is I'm just going to put my
squares<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.230> sides<00:01:19.530> together<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.570> match

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
squares right sides together and match

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
squares right sides together and match
up<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> raw<00:01:22.080> edges<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.190> ready<00:01:23.340> to

right at the edge without a starting

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
right at the edge without a starting
strip<00:01:35.370> it<00:01:35.520> works<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.200> I've<00:01:37.290> done

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
strip it works really well so I've done

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
strip it works really well so I've done
that<00:01:37.530> first<00:01:38.010> one<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.240> I'll<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.600> other

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that first one and now I'll do the other

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
that first one and now I'll do the other
side<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.340> lines<00:01:44.790> of

side so now you can see my two lines of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.830 
side so now you can see my two lines of
stitching<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.830> I'm<00:01:46.830> just<00:01:47.010> going<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.250> cut

straight across from diagonal to

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.640 
straight across from diagonal to
diagonal<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.150> really<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.409> matter

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
diagonal it really doesn't matter

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.020 
diagonal it really doesn't matter
because<00:01:53.010> you've<00:01:53.280> already<00:01:53.580> done<00:01:53.760> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because you've already done the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.640 
because you've already done the
stitching<00:01:54.510> so<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.780> doesn't<00:01:55.080> matter<00:01:55.229> where<00:01:55.500> you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
stitching so it doesn't matter where you

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.980 
stitching so it doesn't matter where you
cut<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.430> seam<00:01:56.640> allowance<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> what

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
cut that's just seam allowance and what

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.950 
cut that's just seam allowance and what
will<00:01:58.140> happen<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> you'll<00:01:59.190> have<00:01:59.250> two

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
will happen now is that you'll have two

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.469 
will happen now is that you'll have two

going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.690> press<00:02:03.960> my<00:02:03.990> squares<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:05.220> triangles

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
going to press my squares my triangles

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.199 
going to press my squares my triangles
into<00:02:06.030> squares<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.159> all<00:02:08.159> I<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.849> press
