 hello spartans I'm dzeko and I'm going to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.089
 talk about what they have to do 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.759
 to send us a move to appear 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.490
 in the next top ten which the 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.310
 thematic will be files so what 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.589
 first they have to do is go to the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.940
 Spartan center which can do it 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:35.330
 with control by pressing the button 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.230
 of being then they go to explorer of 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.840
 files and they go to videos and clips then 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.820
 they go to your local files and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.210
 select the map where they have their 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.830
 video in my case my example is in the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.930
 ragnar map ok so there I give it 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:58.640
 then this is very important, your click is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 you have to call 'top ten' hm2 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.239
 this is so we can look for more 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.150
 easily and download it and once 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.110
 they have their video with that name 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.040
 'top ten' hm2 they give in sending to their 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.040
 shared files 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.490
 and they just have to wait for it 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.190
 load well once your file is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:29.500
 have loaded just go to your files 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.260
 shared and they look for the video they give him the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.070
 button and yellow button options 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.010
 archive 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.340
 and they go to work where they say tag 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:49.040
 then the only thing that I enjoy doing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.040
 would be to put the 'top ten' hm2 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.950
 and well that would be the label for 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.850
 we can create your file 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.149

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.750
