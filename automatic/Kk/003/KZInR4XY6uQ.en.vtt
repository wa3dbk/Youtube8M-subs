impressive piece of technology we're
going<00:00:16.689> to<00:00:16.750> talk<00:00:16.900> about<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.169> CT<00:00:17.650> scanner<00:00:18.039> that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
going to talk about a CT scanner that

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.519 
going to talk about a CT scanner that
can<00:00:18.369> create<00:00:18.640> an<00:00:18.820> image<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.359> detailed<00:00:19.839> image<00:00:20.230> of

can create an image a detailed image of

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.970 
can create an image a detailed image of
the<00:00:20.890> human<00:00:21.130> heart<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:22.480> correct<00:00:22.980> we've

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
the human heart that's correct we've

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.189 
the human heart that's correct we've
been<00:00:24.189> wanting<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.730> have<00:00:24.880> ways<00:00:25.630> that<00:00:25.960> we<00:00:26.050> could

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
been wanting to have ways that we could

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.050 
been wanting to have ways that we could
view<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.769> coronary<00:00:27.279> arteries<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.729> arteries

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
view the coronary arteries the arteries

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.429 
view the coronary arteries the arteries
that<00:00:28.300> supply<00:00:28.630> blood<00:00:28.659> to<00:00:29.019> the<00:00:29.169> heart<00:00:29.349> muscle

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
that supply blood to the heart muscle

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.100 
that supply blood to the heart muscle
without<00:00:30.399> having<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:30.939> put<00:00:31.089> catheters<00:00:31.539> inside

of CT scanners has advanced to the point
where<00:00:39.820> we<00:00:39.940> can<00:00:40.090> now<00:00:40.180> do<00:00:40.240> that<00:00:40.510> let's<00:00:41.020> talk

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
where we can now do that let's talk

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840 
where we can now do that let's talk
about<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.560> advance<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.160> actual<00:00:42.280> picture

about that advance of the actual picture

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.090 
about that advance of the actual picture
the<00:00:42.970> finished<00:00:43.360> photo<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.500> are<00:00:44.830> able<00:00:44.950> to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
the finished photo that you are able to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340 
the finished photo that you are able to
obtain<00:00:45.310> from<00:00:45.850> this<00:00:45.910> scan<00:00:46.420> what<00:00:46.930> does<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.140> allow

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
obtain from this scan what does it allow

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.430 
obtain from this scan what does it allow
you<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:48.360> diagnose<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.720> really<00:00:49.900> see<00:00:50.170> from<00:00:50.380> a

you to diagnose and really see from a

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.650 
you to diagnose and really see from a
doctor's<00:00:50.770> perspective<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.150> number<00:00:52.420> of

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
doctor's perspective there's a number of

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.300 
doctor's perspective there's a number of
different<00:00:52.870> conditions<00:00:53.770> that<00:00:53.950> affect<00:00:54.040> the

different conditions that affect the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.860 
different conditions that affect the
heart<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.670> one<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.030> most<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.630> us<00:00:55.720> are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
heart the one that most of us are

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.240 
heart the one that most of us are
concerned<00:00:56.050> concerned<00:00:56.680> about<00:00:56.980> is<00:00:57.070> what<00:00:57.160> we

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
concerned concerned about is what we

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.770 
concerned concerned about is what we
call<00:00:57.400> coronary<00:00:57.880> artery<00:00:58.240> disease<00:00:58.270> it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
call coronary artery disease it's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.900 
call coronary artery disease it's
blockages<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.010> arteries<00:01:00.400> that<00:01:00.579> supply

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
blockages and the arteries that supply

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.400 
blockages and the arteries that supply
the<00:01:00.970> blood<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.420> muscle<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.930> heart<00:01:01.960> and

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
the blood to the muscle of the heart and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.229 
the blood to the muscle of the heart and
on<00:01:02.800> this<00:01:02.920> particular<00:01:03.239> three-dimensional

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
on this particular three-dimensional

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.149 
on this particular three-dimensional
reconstruction<00:01:04.390> you<00:01:05.140> can<00:01:05.319> see<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.799> arteries

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
reconstruction you can see the arteries

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.950 
reconstruction you can see the arteries
running<00:01:06.429> down<00:01:06.789> the<00:01:07.119> front<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.569> the<00:01:07.659> heart<00:01:07.810> and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
running down the front of the heart and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.569 
running down the front of the heart and
the<00:01:08.020> side<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.469> heart<00:01:08.649> they're<00:01:09.219> shown<00:01:09.460> in

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
the side of the heart they're shown in

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.969 
the side of the heart they're shown in
white<00:01:09.609> there<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:11.289> can<00:01:11.409> actually<00:01:11.530> use<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
white there and we can actually use the

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.620 
white there and we can actually use the
scanner<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.399> look<00:01:12.520> inside<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.119> arteries<00:01:13.479> and

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
scanner to look inside the arteries and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.120 
scanner to look inside the arteries and
see<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.960> plaque<00:01:14.200> that's<00:01:14.499> buildup<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.100> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
see the plaque that's buildup in the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.709 
see the plaque that's buildup in the
walls<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.149> find<00:01:16.329> out<00:01:16.420> if<00:01:16.479> there's<00:01:16.600> any

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
walls and to find out if there's any

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.059 
walls and to find out if there's any
serious<00:01:17.170> blockages<00:01:17.619> that<00:01:17.740> might<00:01:17.889> cause<00:01:18.039> a

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
serious blockages that might cause a

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:19.499 
serious blockages that might cause a
heart<00:01:18.249> attack<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.880> for<00:01:19.179> my<00:01:19.240> understanding

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
heart attack and for my understanding

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.989 
heart attack and for my understanding
from<00:01:19.840> what<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.049> understand<00:01:20.439> you<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.770> actually

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
from what I understand you can actually

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.910 
from what I understand you can actually
hone<00:01:21.999> in<00:01:22.179> on<00:01:22.270> even<00:01:22.569> the<00:01:22.659> smallest<00:01:22.990> blockage

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
hone in on even the smallest blockage

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.950 
hone in on even the smallest blockage
that<00:01:24.189> might<00:01:24.789> be<00:01:24.909> affecting<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.359> heart<00:01:25.569> yeah

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
that might be affecting the heart yeah

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.289 
that might be affecting the heart yeah
that's<00:01:26.170> correct<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:27.100> past<00:01:27.369> stress<00:01:27.999> tests

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
that's correct in the past stress tests

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.029 
that's correct in the past stress tests
that<00:01:28.539> have<00:01:28.600> been<00:01:28.869> used<00:01:29.109> to<00:01:29.439> diagnose<00:01:29.799> heart

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
that have been used to diagnose heart

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.910 
that have been used to diagnose heart
disease<00:01:30.569> really<00:01:31.569> can<00:01:31.689> only<00:01:31.810> diagnose<00:01:32.350> severe

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
disease really can only diagnose severe

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.469 
disease really can only diagnose severe
blockages<00:01:33.459> when<00:01:33.729> there<00:01:33.939> is<00:01:34.030> more<00:01:34.299> than

blockages when there is more than

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.270 
blockages when there is more than
seventy<00:01:34.899> percent<00:01:35.020> occlusion<00:01:35.709> of<00:01:35.829> an<00:01:35.979> artery

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
seventy percent occlusion of an artery

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.099 
seventy percent occlusion of an artery
and<00:01:36.520> now<00:01:36.999> with<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.299> technology<00:01:37.630> we<00:01:37.929> can

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
and now with this technology we can

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.020 
and now with this technology we can
begin<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.499> see<00:01:38.619> these<00:01:38.920> at<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.310> very<00:01:39.759> very

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
begin to see these at the very very

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.819 
begin to see these at the very very
early<00:01:40.179> stages<00:01:40.749> in<00:01:41.020> which<00:01:41.109> they<00:01:41.259> first<00:01:41.469> develop

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
early stages in which they first develop

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.440 
early stages in which they first develop
and<00:01:42.100> what<00:01:42.249> are<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.399> benefits<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.999> catching<00:01:43.359> it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
and what are the benefits to catching it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
and what are the benefits to catching it
in<00:01:43.479> those<00:01:43.659> early<00:01:43.689> stages<00:01:44.139> well<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.799> the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
in those early stages well the the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.519 
in those early stages well the the
reality<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.689> most<00:01:47.020> people<00:01:47.439> with

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:47.529 
reality is that most people with

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.080 
reality is that most people with
blockages<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.009> their<00:01:48.159> arteries<00:01:48.490> don't<00:01:48.850> have

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
blockages and their arteries don't have

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.169 
blockages and their arteries don't have
symptoms<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:50.009> somewhere<00:01:51.009> between<00:01:51.130> 25<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.700> 50

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
symptoms and somewhere between 25 and 50

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.819 
symptoms and somewhere between 25 and 50
percent<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.569> people<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:53.049> ultimately<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:53.799> a

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
percent of people that ultimately have a

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.010 
percent of people that ultimately have a
heart<00:01:54.069> attack<00:01:54.359> don't<00:01:55.359> have<00:01:55.539> any<00:01:55.659> warning

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
heart attack don't have any warning

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.480 
heart attack don't have any warning
symptoms<00:01:56.200> ahead<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.649> time<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:56.859> we<00:01:57.249> would<00:01:57.369> have

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
symptoms ahead of time so we would have

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.550 
symptoms ahead of time so we would have
no<00:01:57.729> way<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:57.969> know<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.810> they<00:01:59.079> were<00:01:59.139> at<00:01:59.319> risk

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
no way to know that they were at risk

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.830 
no way to know that they were at risk
now<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.759> can<00:02:00.880> find<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.149> early<00:02:01.299> we<00:02:01.719> can

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
now that we can find it early we can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.129 
now that we can find it early we can
start<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.200> treat<00:02:02.439> people<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.039> we<00:02:03.759> can<00:02:03.969> do<00:02:04.389> drug

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
start to treat people and we can do drug

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.589 
start to treat people and we can do drug
therapies<00:02:05.619> or<00:02:05.979> diet<00:02:06.429> lifestyle<00:02:06.969> modification

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
therapies or diet lifestyle modification

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.580 
therapies or diet lifestyle modification
or<00:02:07.630> even<00:02:07.899> if<00:02:07.959> we<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.259> do<00:02:08.349> something

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
or even if we have to do something

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.990 
or even if we have to do something
invasive<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.280> putting<00:02:09.520> in<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.670> stent<00:02:09.729> or

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
invasive like putting in a stent or

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.050 
invasive like putting in a stent or
bypass<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.650> find<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.010> before<00:02:12.160> people<00:02:12.490> have

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
bypass we can find it before people have

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.440 
bypass we can find it before people have
a<00:02:13.090> heart

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
a heart

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.809 
a heart
is<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:14.170> scan<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.709> procedure<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.520> patient

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
is this scan a procedure that a patient

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.390 
is this scan a procedure that a patient
can<00:02:16.270> request<00:02:17.110> or<00:02:17.410> who<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.739> recommended<00:02:17.890> for

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
can request or who is it recommended for

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.390 
can request or who is it recommended for
so<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.830> bit<00:02:21.010> complicated

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
so it's it's a little bit complicated

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.970 
so it's it's a little bit complicated
there's<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.209> screening<00:02:22.959> version<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.680> test

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
there's a screening version of this test

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.259 
there's a screening version of this test
that's<00:02:24.280> easier<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.790> called<00:02:24.940> coronary

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
that's easier it's called coronary

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.449 
that's easier it's called coronary
calcium<00:02:25.720> scan<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.890> images<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.220> are

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
calcium scan and the images that are

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.089 
calcium scan and the images that are
showing<00:02:27.879> right<00:02:28.209> now<00:02:28.290> show<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.739> white<00:02:30.069> is

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
showing right now show that the white is

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.380 
showing right now show that the white is
the<00:02:30.400> calcium<00:02:30.819> that's<00:02:30.970> built<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.330> the

the calcium that's built up in the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.670 
the calcium that's built up in the
arteries<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> heart<00:02:31.900> that's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.650> very

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
arteries of the heart that's a very

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.759 
arteries of the heart that's a very
simple<00:02:33.459> safe<00:02:34.060> test<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.750> at<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.349> point<00:02:35.590> a

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
simple safe test and at this point a

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.100 
simple safe test and at this point a

number of places including ourselves are

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.809 
number of places including ourselves are

and request the test the issue becomes

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
and request the test the issue becomes
if<00:02:42.580> we<00:02:42.670> find<00:02:42.879> something<00:02:43.030> then<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.080> really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
if we find something then you really

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.720 
if we find something then you really
need<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.500> help<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.920> physician<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.519> know

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
need the help of a physician to know

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.000 
need the help of a physician to know
what<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.000> with<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.810> more<00:02:47.380> involved

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
what to do with it the more involved

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.130 
what to do with it the more involved
test<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> CT<00:02:48.700> angiogram<00:02:49.120> where<00:02:50.049> we

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
test the CT angiogram where we

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.050 
test the CT angiogram where we
administer<00:02:50.590> contrast<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.459> we<00:02:51.549> actually<00:02:51.819> see

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
administer contrast and we actually see

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.229 
administer contrast and we actually see
the<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.870> inside<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.709> artery<00:02:54.069> we're<00:02:55.030> still

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
the the inside of the artery we're still

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.610 
the the inside of the artery we're still
requiring<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.690> physician<00:02:55.989> referral<00:02:56.349> for<00:02:56.500> that

requiring a physician referral for that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
requiring a physician referral for that
you<00:02:57.040> mentioned<00:02:57.459> safety<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.329> there's<00:02:58.720> been

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you mentioned safety and there's been

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.509 
you mentioned safety and there's been
some<00:02:58.989> recent<00:02:59.079> concerns<00:02:59.440> over<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.040> amount<00:03:00.459> of

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
some recent concerns over the amount of

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.300 
some recent concerns over the amount of
radiation<00:03:00.989> someone<00:03:01.989> occurs<00:03:02.470> from<00:03:02.739> enclosed

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
from CT scans is that a concern yeah

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.410 
from CT scans is that a concern yeah
it's<00:03:06.010> definitely<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.489> concern<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:07.180> very

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
it's definitely a concern it's very

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.600 
it's definitely a concern it's very
interesting<00:03:07.959> CT<00:03:08.769> scans<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.250> been<00:03:09.280> around

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
interesting CT scans have been around

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.880

there's<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.910> about<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.540> think<00:03:14.079> 60<00:03:14.380> million<00:03:14.620> CT

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
there's now about I think 60 million CT

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.620 
there's now about I think 60 million CT
scans<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.549> year<00:03:15.730> performed<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.299> United

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
scans a year performed in the United

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.650 
scans a year performed in the United
States<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.709> huge<00:03:17.980> number<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.660> until

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
States it's a huge number and until

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.840 
States it's a huge number and until
cardiac<00:03:20.440> CT<00:03:20.680> came<00:03:21.010> around<00:03:21.250> people<00:03:21.700> weren't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
cardiac CT came around people weren't

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.960 
cardiac CT came around people weren't
very<00:03:22.060> concerned<00:03:22.420> about<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.780> radiation<00:03:23.290> and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
very concerned about the radiation and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.129 
very concerned about the radiation and
interestingly<00:03:24.970> enough<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.660> been<00:03:25.810> one<00:03:26.019> of

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
interestingly enough it's been one of

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.599 
interestingly enough it's been one of
the<00:03:26.200> arguments<00:03:26.470> made<00:03:26.829> about<00:03:27.069> why<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.459> should

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
the arguments made about why we should

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.910 
the arguments made about why we should
not<00:03:27.639> be<00:03:28.090> doing<00:03:28.389> these<00:03:28.569> cardiac<00:03:28.959> CT<00:03:29.139> s<00:03:29.350> but

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
not be doing these cardiac CT s but

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.349 
not be doing these cardiac CT s but
because<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.250> all<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> attention<00:03:30.940> we've<00:03:31.120> come

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
because of all the attention we've come

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.030 
because of all the attention we've come
up<00:03:31.389> with<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.690> number<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.139> ways<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.590> reduce<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
up with a number of ways to reduce the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.789 
up with a number of ways to reduce the
radiation<00:03:33.459> exposure<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.120> now<00:03:34.810> cardiac<00:03:35.350> CT<00:03:35.530> is

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
radiation exposure and now cardiac CT is

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.140 
radiation exposure and now cardiac CT is
actually<00:03:36.130> leading<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.549> rest<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:36.940> field

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
actually leading the rest of the field

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.930 
actually leading the rest of the field
in<00:03:37.630> terms<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.230> having<00:03:38.769> less<00:03:39.100> radiation<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
in terms of having less radiation and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.479 
in terms of having less radiation and
right<00:03:40.930> now<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.109> can<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> CT<00:03:42.040> scan<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
right now I can do a CT scan on the

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.520 
right now I can do a CT scan on the
heart<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.850> most<00:03:43.030> people<00:03:43.389> with<00:03:43.569> about<00:03:44.290> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
heart and most people with about the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.309 
heart and most people with about the
same<00:03:44.799> amount<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:45.250> radiation<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.850> receive

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
same amount of radiation you receive

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.569 
same amount of radiation you receive
just<00:03:47.319> from<00:03:47.500> background<00:03:47.950> from<00:03:48.190> cosmic

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
just from background from cosmic

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.520

year<00:03:50.560> there's<00:03:51.190> about<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> equivalent<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.030> one

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.849 
year there's about the equivalent of one
cardiac<00:03:52.750> CT<00:03:52.930> scan<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.709> impressive

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
cardiac CT scan it's impressive
