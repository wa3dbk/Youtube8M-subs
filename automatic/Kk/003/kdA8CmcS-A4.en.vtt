00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.859
 good friends, today we bring you a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 incredible tutorial let's talk a little 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 first what all are currently looking for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 the developers when they create a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.640
 application or game is to be able to reach 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 as many platforms as possible 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.449
 who develop operating systems 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 like for example microsoft apple or 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 google also want to create their 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 systems reach the largest number of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 possible applications but the problem 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 it comes when we talk about running 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.570
 applications or games of a system 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 mobile as android in a fixed as 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 windows for example personally 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 I would like to be able to run my games 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.100
 favorite android on windows and play them 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 full screen with a keyboard and mouse 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 It would be great to find this possibility 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.570
 of series but the reality is that only 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.320
 there are two or three ways to do it let's see 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.229
 how to do it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.640
 to be able to download and install 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.520
 applications and android games in a 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.010
 pc with windows there are two ways or methods 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.960
 really functional on the one hand 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.820
 we have the option to install the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.220
 aesthetics of android that use the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.110
 programmers to create and emulate their 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.630
 applications but it takes up too much 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.650
 disk space and is complex 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.990
 use however on the other hand 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.180
 we BlueStacks emulator 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.190
 android for windows that allows us 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.110
 download virtually any 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.080
 application that we can install in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.630
 mobile and run it without having 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.630
 that attend to other complex sections 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.409
 your stack is a program that is downloaded 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.270
 from the web blues tax puntocom 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.670
 is currently in beta 1 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.250
 and many bugs have already been fixed 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 found in the alpha version when the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.360
 we install in windows what we open is 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.310
 a kind of android desktop 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.800
 from which we can download 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.590
 applications and games using stores 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.170
 alternatives to google play like amazon 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.170
 appstore year one mobile market 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.750
 the process to download and install 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.000
 applications and android games in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.430
 windows using this method is so 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.250
 simple how to search the content and press 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.350
 about download after download 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.210
 installation the downloaded application 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.210
 will appear in the Mayan menu 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.010
 but we can also install 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.200
 apps and games apk directly 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.050
 in bluestacks without going through the stores 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.970
 very useful to install applications that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.730
 are being developed in forums 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.950
 programmers for example in this case 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.680
 we just have to copy the file apk 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.500
 corresponding in the apps folder of the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 windows library and click on it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.030
 in the applications menu of bluestacks 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.060
 immediately after the installation will be 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.170
 similar to the first method and as you see 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.170
 works perfectly 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.120
 do not 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.320
 one of the limitations that has 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.690
 currently bluestacks is that only us 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.510
 allows you to install a maximum of 26 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.670
 applications is a limitation of the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.000
 beta version that later in the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.800
 next review could disappear without 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.740
 But until then when we arrive 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.210
 to the maximum of installed applications 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.240
 we will have to delete some before 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.220
 try to install new ones therefore for 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.650
 eliminate any application we will have to 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.450
 go to the preferences icon located in 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.670
 the bottom right of bluestacks 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.450
 and choose the admin option 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.460
 applications from it we can with only 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.680
 mark the appropriate and the cube icon 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.700
 of garbage and remove it from our 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.700
 application library 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.930
 we have already learned to download and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.090
 install applications and games 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.549
 android on windows using bluestacks 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.380
 but the application or emulator has 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.230
 some interesting options that 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.030
 we should know for example inside 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.190
 from the preferences menu we can 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.220
 designate the size or resolution of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.170
 screen that each application will have is 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.060
 say if we want you to keep the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.790
 appearance of the application on a mobile 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.680
 or from the tablet version but eye 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.380
 because here we could fall into error 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.450
 to create an aberration in the image if 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.640
 we force the view of an application to 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.370
 present an aspect for which there is 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.860
 been designed the rest as you see friends 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.930
 it's a blast since we can try 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.210
 applications and games without windows without 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.690
 have to use it on our phone 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.690
 mobile
