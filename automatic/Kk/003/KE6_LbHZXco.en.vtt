i<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.520> tested<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:22.710> only<00:01:22.890> works<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
i have tested it and this only works in

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.510 
i have tested it and this only works in
forge<00:01:24.680> well<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.340> now

doing I was still teaching him the
glitch<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.670> he<00:01:53.759> goes<00:01:53.909> forward<00:01:54.509> she

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
glitch as we go so he goes forward she

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
glitch as we go so he goes forward she
spawns<00:01:54.960> another<00:01:55.850> picks<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.979> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
