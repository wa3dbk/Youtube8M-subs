00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
of the reel seat on the rod to give it a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
of the reel seat on the rod to give it a
little<00:01:25.950> extra<00:01:26.310> support<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.060> looking<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
little extra support and looking at the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
little extra support and looking at the
front<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> reel<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
front of the the reel here that will

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
front of the the reel here that will
actually<00:01:29.970> hook<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
actually hook on like this so you can

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually hook on like this so you can
imagine<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> rod<00:01:34.700> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
imagine if it was on a on a rod that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
imagine if it was on a on a rod that
would<00:01:35.850> actually<00:01:36.119> add<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.110> whole<00:01:37.409> lot

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
would actually add a lot of a whole lot

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
would actually add a lot of a whole lot
more<00:01:37.710> support<00:01:38.070> take<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.579> strain

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
more support take a little bit strain

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.889 
more support take a little bit strain
off<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> reel<00:01:39.390> seat<00:01:41.000> going<00:01:42.000> over<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> reel

off of the reel seat going over the reel

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.310 
off of the reel seat going over the reel
itself<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> bottom<00:01:45.869> we'll

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
itself you can see on the bottom we'll

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
itself you can see on the bottom we'll

very<00:02:46.470> simple<00:02:47.569> all<00:02:48.569> right<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> other<00:02:48.959> side

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
very simple all right the other side

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.699 
very simple all right the other side
what<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.120> see<00:02:51.299> here<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:52.500> does<00:02:52.680> have

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
what you can see here is it does have

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.680 
what you can see here is it does have
the<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.390> switch<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:55.670> retrieve<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.000> free

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the the switch for retrieve and free

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.710 
the the switch for retrieve and free
spool<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.700> free<00:02:59.940> spool<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.599> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
spool it's on free spool now and it is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.740 
spool it's on free spool now and it is
labeled<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.260> there's<00:03:01.410> no<00:03:01.530> confusion<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:03.569> is

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
labeled so there's no confusion this is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.750 
labeled so there's no confusion this is
a<00:03:03.780> star<00:03:04.260> drag<00:03:04.500> system<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:06.329> simply<00:03:07.700> tighten<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
a star drag system so simply tighten the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.210 
a star drag system so simply tighten the
drag<00:03:09.200> when<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.590> rod<00:03:10.769> it'll<00:03:11.040> tighten

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
drag when it's on the rod it'll tighten

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.550 
drag when it's on the rod it'll tighten
clockwise<00:03:11.810> which<00:03:12.810> will<00:03:12.989> tighten<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.410> drag

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
clockwise which will tighten the drag

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.180 
clockwise which will tighten the drag
and<00:03:14.359> counterclockwise<00:03:15.769> which<00:03:16.769> will<00:03:16.980> loosen

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
and counterclockwise which will loosen

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.539 
and counterclockwise which will loosen
the<00:03:17.430> drag<00:03:18.109> does<00:03:19.109> have<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> fairly<00:03:19.620> large<00:03:19.889> drag

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
the drag does have a fairly large drag

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.080 
the drag does have a fairly large drag
system<00:03:20.880> inside<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:22.489> much<00:03:23.489> larger<00:03:23.700> than<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
system inside of it much larger than the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.520 
system inside of it much larger than the
six<00:03:24.299> alter<00:03:24.569> for<00:03:24.750> odd<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.079> anything<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.410> that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
six alter for odd or anything with that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.830 
six alter for odd or anything with that
but<00:03:25.650> once<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.859> get<00:03:25.950> into<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.700> 12<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.150> 14<00:03:27.510> alts

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
but once you get into the 12 and 14 alts

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.960 
but once you get into the 12 and 14 alts
that's<00:03:28.019> when<00:03:28.169> it's<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.489> largest

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that's when it's going to be the largest

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.940 
that's when it's going to be the largest
but<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.540> one's<00:03:30.720> pretty<00:03:30.900> good<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.530> does<00:03:31.709> very

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
but this one's pretty good it does very

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.159 
but this one's pretty good it does very
well<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.910> handle<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> newer<00:03:33.569> style<00:03:33.930> right

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
well the handle is a newer style right

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.409 
well the handle is a newer style right
here<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:35.250> does<00:03:35.489> have<00:03:35.669> two<00:03:35.849> different<00:03:36.209> settings

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
here it does have two different settings

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.839 
here it does have two different settings
that<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.349> use<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.919> on<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
that you can use I have it on the the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.190 
that you can use I have it on the the
larger<00:03:39.239> setting<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.690> adds<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:39.989> bit<00:03:40.109> more

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
larger setting it adds a little bit more

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020 
larger setting it adds a little bit more
torque<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:41.220> when<00:03:41.340> you're<00:03:41.459> reeling<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.880> big

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
torque to when you're reeling in a big
