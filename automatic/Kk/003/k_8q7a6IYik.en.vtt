projects<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.580> collaborative<00:02:53.060> and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450

projects are not this collaborative and
this<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.870> clearly<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.920> many<00:02:55.070> ways<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.640> me<00:02:55.790> at

this so clearly in so many ways to me at

this so clearly in so many ways to me at
least<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.239> makes<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.840> another<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.380> Harry
