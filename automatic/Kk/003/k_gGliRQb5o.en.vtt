as you know Michelle's got a ton of
games

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.740 

at<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.610> gate<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> way<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.240> into<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.570> but

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
at the gate all the way up into you but

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.910 
at the gate all the way up into you but
we're<00:02:59.900> going<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.050> play<00:03:00.290> something<00:03:00.530> little<00:03:00.800> bit

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
faster so you check out tracking on this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:19.839 
faster so you check out tracking on this
