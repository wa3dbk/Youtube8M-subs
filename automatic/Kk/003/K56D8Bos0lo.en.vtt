00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 iris garden video bund come my name 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.170
 Markus is our subject today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 Edible tape live from the plantarium 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.559
 ingo scope in front of me is first of all 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.870
 the edible wall here in black 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.449
 in between vegetables and here leon of 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 Circlewide explain us a bit 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.029
 How this edible wall works 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 leon what was the goal of this subway was 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.070
 it pretty much without own vegetable garden and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.500
 edible flowers grow in abundance again 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.690
 just in the smallest of spaces 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 ok and vertical so you do not have to do it all 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 make surface so that will be cleaned up 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.700
 where can this be hung everywhere? 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.110
 It can also be money to everyone 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.489
 finished in the garden or balcony terrace 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 or what exactly is that material 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 this looks like baby jeans fabric 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 Almost from what kind of material is that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.309
 was needed here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.020
 The material is made from recycled 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 European transparent pet bottles 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.409
 94 percent she points to material and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.409
 one that I 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.880
 that with affection okay and what are they 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.630
 characteristics of this material it is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 pity that transferred that let 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.430
 water is through and the color is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.900
 uv-resistant okay but if now me 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.090
 this is the place in here right now 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.119
 Irrigation installed shows that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.220
 is that as we watered here 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.510
 much of the water down here as 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 you have to imagine that 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.880
 the inside of rocket is petra 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.890
 Kasch I would like to have a contact 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.050
 The fear that the water therein 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.119
 making and in the pressure becomes too great then 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.479
 the water goes in the post area there again 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.509
 Out 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.570
 but the water goes out but stuck 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.190
 the ok so it stays in there as goes 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.649
 others out if it is too wet so that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.450
 that no stagnation Gerd Opitz where 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:14.709
 what will the water be like? 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:16.720
 this system is brought in and that will 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.549
 then reduced with a pressure filter 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.260
 from normal pressure of her life else 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.390
 are you too much or too little 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.790
 pressure that will be here in this valve 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.480
 turning that will reduce the normal 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 Water squeezed from the water pipe 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:37.090
 between three and six reduced after 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.100
 a great and a filter is also in it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.989
 so that the whole thing gets different 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.739
 yes, if you do that later on the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.739
 4 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.480
 no sand or okay now how 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.879
 This product has been around for years 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.629
 there were edible since market 2012 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.209
 the ice still completely new sold yes 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.170
 also in switzerland and germany then 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.410
 ethical considerations 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.180
 ok great so we will try hard 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.099
 maybe one or the other 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.810
 to show edible untied garden video 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.470
 maybe on www opera comes to you 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.140
