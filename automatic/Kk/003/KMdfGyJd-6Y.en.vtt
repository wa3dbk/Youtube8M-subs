00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the black light you can see the color

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
the black light you can see the color
the<00:01:16.530> pigment<00:01:17.130> coming<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.790> well

orange and another yellow when I bring
the<00:01:52.600> ultraviolet<00:01:53.049> light<00:01:53.380> on<00:01:53.500> them<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.759> can

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the ultraviolet light on them you can

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.669 
the ultraviolet light on them you can
see<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> fluorescence<00:01:55.750> now<00:01:55.929> we're<00:01:56.079> seeing<00:01:56.229> blue

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
see a fluorescence now we're seeing blue

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.219 
see a fluorescence now we're seeing blue
a<00:01:56.710> purple<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.700> orange<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.390> yellow<00:01:58.420> orange<00:01:59.110> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
that away put that back it's a very nice

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.050 
that away put that back it's a very nice
set<00:02:04.990> now<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.890> one<00:02:06.069> on<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.340> far<00:02:06.549> left<00:02:06.819> there

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
set now the one on the far left there

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.559 
set now the one on the far left there
that's<00:02:07.450> clear<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.110> turns<00:02:08.709> blue<00:02:09.069> is<00:02:09.569> quinine

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
that's clear and turns blue is quinine

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.229 
that's clear and turns blue is quinine
and<00:02:10.890> quinine<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.340> tonic<00:02:12.670> water<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.150> you

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239

black light in area it will glow in the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.699 
black light in area it will glow in the
dark<00:02:17.019> blue<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.680> okay<00:02:18.959> now<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.410> other

dark blue like this okay now so other
things<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.519> can<00:02:21.640> buy<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.940> supermarket<00:02:22.090> if

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
things you can buy in a supermarket if

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.620 
things you can buy in a supermarket if
you<00:02:22.989> take<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> banana<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.120> look<00:02:25.360> at<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
you take a banana and you look at the

if you go ahead and look at it under a
blacklight<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.680> see<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.010> live<00:02:37.600> now<00:02:38.600> low

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
blacklight you can see it live now low

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.260 
blacklight you can see it live now low
on<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:40.340> glow<00:02:41.000> strip<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> called<00:02:43.550> grope

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
blacklight now we're going to switch

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.810 
blacklight now we're going to switch
sides<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.830> for<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.040> second<00:03:10.430> when<00:03:10.520> we<00:03:10.550> come

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
sides here for a second when we come

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.410 
sides here for a second when we come
over<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.120> little<00:03:11.240> closer<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.709> last<00:03:12.980> few<00:03:13.420> money

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
over a little closer the last few money

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.890 
over a little closer the last few money
has<00:03:15.170> europium<00:03:15.800> in<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.300> europium

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
has europium in it and that europium

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.230 
has europium in it and that europium
gives<00:03:18.230> off<00:03:18.580> different<00:03:19.580> signals<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.060> if<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
gives off different signals so if you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.790 
gives off different signals so if you
look<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.990> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:21.320> kind<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.709> an

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
look at this you can see kind of an

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.890 
look at this you can see kind of an
orange<00:03:22.010> strip<00:03:22.430> on<00:03:22.610> there<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.540> helps

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
orange strip on there and that helps

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.770 
orange strip on there and that helps
with<00:03:24.110> deterring<00:03:24.560> from<00:03:24.920> counter<00:03:25.250> theft

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
with deterring from counter theft

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.300 
with deterring from counter theft
counterfeits<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.959> there's<00:03:27.620> also<00:03:27.800> blue<00:03:28.130> and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
counterfeits and there's also blue and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.740 
counterfeits and there's also blue and
now<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.520> five<00:03:28.730> looks<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> little<00:03:29.300> newer<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:29.690> I

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
now this five looks a little newer so I

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.020 
now this five looks a little newer so I
can<00:03:29.930> actually<00:03:30.020> see<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.410> few<00:03:30.680> 5s<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.940> then

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
can actually see a few 5s here and then

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.550

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
blacklight on it it's going to activate

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.110 
blacklight on it it's going to activate
that<00:05:22.889> glow<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.430> dark<00:05:23.669> pigment<00:05:25.190> okay<00:05:26.190> then
