00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
which is completely fine but some people

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.770 
which is completely fine but some people
might<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.490> not<00:00:14.759> know<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.450> those<00:00:15.540> people

that do not know hopefully this helps
and<00:00:17.160> let's<00:00:17.280> get<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.400> shit<00:00:17.580> started<00:00:17.820> alright

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
and let's get this shit started alright

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.279 
and let's get this shit started alright
so<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> first<00:00:18.600> step<00:00:18.870> I'm<00:00:18.990> gonna<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.199> giving

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so the first step I'm gonna be giving

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.540 
so the first step I'm gonna be giving
you<00:00:19.470> guys<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.740> only<00:00:19.949> apply<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.220> certain

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
you guys can only apply to certain

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.339 
you guys can only apply to certain
strategies<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.210> certain<00:00:21.510> maps<00:00:21.660> mainly<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
strategies on certain maps mainly the

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.720 
strategies on certain maps mainly the
strategies<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.160> involved<00:00:23.519> really

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
strategies that just involved really

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.950 
strategies that just involved really
sort<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.090> running<00:00:24.210> around<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.599> open<00:00:24.840> area

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
sort of running around in an open area

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
sort of running around in an open area
or<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.349> big<00:00:25.560> circle<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:26.160> ascension<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.150> move

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
or a big circle like ascension or move

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.580 
or a big circle like ascension or move
something<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.289> where<00:00:28.410> you're

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
something like that to where you're

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
something like that to where you're
basically<00:00:28.679> just<00:00:28.920> running<00:00:29.250> around<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.910> big

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
basically just running around and a big

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.279 
basically just running around and a big
open<00:00:30.420> area<00:00:30.539> where<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> zombies

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
open area where you have the zombies

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.480 
open area where you have the zombies
following<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.220> then<00:00:32.369> you're<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
following you and then you're just

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.250 
following you and then you're just
running<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> circle<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.510> around<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.080> same

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
running in a circle or around the same

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.840 
running in a circle or around the same
spot<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.650> and<00:00:34.830> over<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.190> again<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
spot over and over and over again the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.220 
spot over and over and over again the
strategy<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.210> very<00:00:36.420> helpful<00:00:36.629> it'll<00:00:36.930> save<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
strategy is very helpful it'll save you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.479 
strategy is very helpful it'll save you
a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.770> long<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.430> you're

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
a lot as long as you know what you're

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
a lot as long as you know what you're
doing<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.850> basically<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> strategy<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.660> say

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
doing so basically the strategy is say

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
doing so basically the strategy is say
you're<00:00:40.290> running<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> circle<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you're running in the circle and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
you're running in the circle and
ascension<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.700> example<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.210> tend<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.539> run

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
ascension for an example I tend to run

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.029 
ascension for an example I tend to run
counter<00:00:42.899> clockwise<00:00:43.110> mainly<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
counter clockwise mainly because this is

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.139 
counter clockwise mainly because this is
how<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.610> strategies<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.120> always

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
how I like to do my strategies I always

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
how I like to do my strategies I always
run<00:00:45.420> counter<00:00:45.719> clockwise<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.680> you're

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
run counter clockwise and when you're

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.139 
run counter clockwise and when you're
running<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.129> sometimes<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> always<00:00:48.059> going

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
running around sometimes is always going

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
running around sometimes is always going
to<00:00:48.239> cut<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to cut you off right here now a lot of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
to cut you off right here now a lot of
people's<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.250> instinct<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
people's first instinct is to one just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.000 
people's first instinct is to one just
try<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> run<00:00:51.930> through<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.289> even<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.649> past<00:00:52.770> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
try to run through and even get past in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
try to run through and even get past in
which<00:00:53.039> most<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> time<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> know

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
which most of the time you know

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.610 
which most of the time you know
sometimes<00:00:54.629> it'll<00:00:54.780> work<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.140> sometimes<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sometimes it'll work but sometimes you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080 
sometimes it'll work but sometimes you
also<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.920> caught<00:00:56.129> lezama<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> you'll<00:00:56.969> end

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
also get caught lezama be and you'll end

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
also get caught lezama be and you'll end
up<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.180> down<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> just

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
up going down people also like to just

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.900 
up going down people also like to just
see<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.340> shoot<00:00:59.489> their<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.699> through

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
see if they can shoot their way through

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
see if they can shoot their way through
its<00:01:00.059> maybe<00:01:00.210> they'll<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> thundergun<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
its maybe they'll have the thundergun a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
its maybe they'll have the thundergun a
ray<00:01:01.109> gun<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.769> good<00:01:01.980> idea<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.309> it's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
ray gun which is a good idea but it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.799 
ray gun which is a good idea but it's
also<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> waste<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> ammo<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> don't

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
also a waste of ammo and if you don't

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.850 
also a waste of ammo and if you don't
have<00:01:03.899> flopper<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.410> ray<00:01:04.530> gun<00:01:04.559> you're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
have flopper with a ray gun you're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.960 
have flopper with a ray gun you're
probably<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.430> yourself<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
probably going to down yourself if you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.310 
probably going to down yourself if you
try<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> ground<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.050> instead<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
try to get the ground but instead of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.420 
try to get the ground but instead of
doing<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.620> what<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
doing that what I like to do is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
doing that what I like to do is
basically<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.300> when<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
basically just do you when you do you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
basically just do you when you do you
basically<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.440> turn<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
basically just turn around and do it you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
basically just turn around and do it you
all<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.120> way<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.480> other<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
all the way out to the other side and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.540 
all the way out to the other side and
either<00:01:13.260> continue<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> cycle<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
either continue the cycle going the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.610 
either continue the cycle going the
opposite<00:01:14.850> direction<00:01:14.910> or<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.840> another<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
opposite direction or do another you and

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.200 
opposite direction or do another you and
get<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.950> cycle<00:01:17.310> set<00:01:17.460> back<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.730> how<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.940> want

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
get your cycle set back up how you want

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
get your cycle set back up how you want
it<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> there's<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.230> another<00:01:19.380> version<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it to there's also another version of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.050 
it to there's also another version of
this<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.010> I<00:01:20.250> tend<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this which I tend to do I'm going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
this which I tend to do I'm going to
high<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.510> as<00:01:21.780> soon<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.170> round<00:01:22.350> starts

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
high around as soon as the round starts

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.260 
high around as soon as the round starts
basically<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.190> start<00:01:23.430> off<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> where

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
basically just start off to you where

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.370 
basically just start off to you where
you<00:01:24.330> basically<00:01:24.510> just<00:01:24.660> keep<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you basically just keep going back and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
you basically just keep going back and
forth<00:01:25.800> in<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.100> U<00:01:26.190> shape<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> zombies<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.330> all

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
forth in the U shape and zombies are all

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.310 
forth in the U shape and zombies are all
going<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.600> stay<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.260> middle

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
going to stay right here in the middle

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.720 
going to stay right here in the middle
now<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.800> very<00:01:28.950> good<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.640> use

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
now this is very good if you want to use

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.010 
now this is very good if you want to use
like<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> Wonder<00:01:30.240> weapon<00:01:30.330> on<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.690> because

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
like the Wonder weapon on them because

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.090 
like the Wonder weapon on them because
they're<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.530> bunched<00:01:31.830> up<00:01:31.950> in

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they're all going to be bunched up in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.290 
they're all going to be bunched up in
one<00:01:32.370> certain<00:01:32.580> area<00:01:32.910> is<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.270> very

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
one certain area is going to be very

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.180 
one certain area is going to be very
easy<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> hit<00:01:33.870> them<00:01:34.050> all<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.410> it's<00:01:34.800> also<00:01:34.920> very

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
easy to hit them all and it's also very

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.590 
easy to hit them all and it's also very
good<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.910> case<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.270> caught<00:01:36.450> off

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
good because in case you get caught off

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.700 
good because in case you get caught off
you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.080> fall<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.500> because

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you can actually fall back because

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.020 
you can actually fall back because
you'll<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.100> room<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.730> you're<00:01:38.850> just

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you'll have more room that you're just

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.160 
you'll have more room that you're just
doing<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.300> you<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> zombies<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:40.020> going

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
doing to you all the zombies are going

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.510 
doing to you all the zombies are going
to<00:01:40.230> be<00:01:40.290> stayed<00:01:40.440> in<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.710> area<00:01:40.950> at<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.250> front

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to be stayed in one area at the front

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
to be stayed in one area at the front
and<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> room<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.600> fall<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and you of all the room to fall back to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
and you of all the room to fall back to
in<00:01:43.260> case<00:01:43.410> something<00:01:43.680> goes<00:01:43.770> wrong<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> tend

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
in case something goes wrong so I tend

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.770 
in case something goes wrong so I tend
to<00:01:44.730> do<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.150> beginning<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.480> rounds

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
to do this at the beginning of rounds

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.670 
to do this at the beginning of rounds
and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:45.930> once<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.230> round<00:01:46.380> starts<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and then once the round starts to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
and then once the round starts to
progress<00:01:46.980> that's<00:01:47.430> usually<00:01:47.760> when<00:01:47.880> I'll<00:01:47.970> start

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
progress that's usually when I'll start

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
progress that's usually when I'll start
doing<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> complete<00:01:48.690> cycles<00:01:49.230> that<00:01:49.350> way<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
doing the complete cycles that way I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
doing the complete cycles that way I
have<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.920> time<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.370> more<00:01:50.460> room<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.910> you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
have more time and more room and you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.490 
have more time and more room and you
just<00:01:51.510> get<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.690> little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:51.960> breathing<00:01:52.320> room<00:01:52.380> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
just get a little bit breathing room we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
just get a little bit breathing room we
start<00:01:52.740> doing<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.370> again<00:01:53.760> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
start doing this you and again the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
start doing this you and again the
strategy<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.450> only<00:01:54.600> works<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.020> certain

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
strategy really only works for certain

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.110 
strategy really only works for certain
maps<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.830> certain<00:01:56.010> strategies<00:01:56.430> mainly<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
maps and certain strategies mainly the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.370 
maps and certain strategies mainly the
ones<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.510> involved<00:01:57.930> may<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.170> either

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
ones that just involved may be either

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
ones that just involved may be either
tight<00:01:58.710> corridors<00:01:59.040> circle<00:01:59.580> strategies<00:02:00.030> or

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
tight corridors circle strategies or

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.360 
tight corridors circle strategies or
maybe<00:02:00.780> big<00:02:01.050> open<00:02:01.350> area<00:02:01.470> circle<00:02:01.980> strategy

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
maybe big open area circle strategy

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.950 
maybe big open area circle strategy
doesn't<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.030> work<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.360> some<00:02:03.570> map<00:02:03.750> like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
doesn't really work with some map like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.850 
doesn't really work with some map like
he<00:02:04.080> know<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.440> wouldn't<00:02:04.770> work

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
he know that's really wouldn't work

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.930 
he know that's really wouldn't work
because<00:02:05.010> kino<00:02:05.460> there's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> couple<00:02:05.760> different

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
because kino there's a couple different

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.460 
because kino there's a couple different
strategies<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.660> mainly<00:02:06.900> they<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.170> involve

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
strategies and mainly they just involve

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.080 
strategies and mainly they just involve
going<00:02:07.920> around<00:02:08.190> certain<00:02:08.459> area<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:08.910> really

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
going around certain area don't really

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
going around certain area don't really
have<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> big<00:02:09.420> open<00:02:09.690> area<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> kino<00:02:10.289> mainly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
have a big open area on kino mainly

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
have a big open area on kino mainly
either<00:02:11.070> have<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> stage<00:02:11.520> we're<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.910> running

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
either have the stage we're just running

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.460 
either have the stage we're just running
around<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> map<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.720> basically<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.110> zombies

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
around the map and basically the zombies

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
around the map and basically the zombies
can<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.680> following<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.490> join<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
can be following you on that so join a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
typically given you guys is basically

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720 
typically given you guys is basically
awareness<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.010> basically<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
awareness and that's basically just to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.820 
awareness and that's basically just to
do<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> 360<00:02:24.540> every<00:02:24.750> now<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> then<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> have

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
do a 360 every now and then now you have

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.620 
do a 360 every now and then now you have
been<00:02:25.920> thinking<00:02:26.160> what<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.490> do<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> 360<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
been thinking what I do a 360 and the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.760 
been thinking what I do a 360 and the
reason<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.110> mainly<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> make

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
reason for this is mainly just to make

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.050 
reason for this is mainly just to make
sure<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.100> there's<00:02:29.250> no<00:02:29.370> zombies<00:02:29.820> coming

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.340 
sure that there's no zombies coming
towards<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.750> direction<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.140> can't

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
towards you from a direction you can't

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.990 
towards you from a direction you can't
see<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.740> say<00:02:32.220> you're<00:02:32.370> backpedaling<00:02:32.670> down<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
see so say you're backpedaling down a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.490 
see so say you're backpedaling down a
corridor<00:02:33.270> shooting<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.810> zombies<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.440> know

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
corridor shooting in zombies you know

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.600 
corridor shooting in zombies you know
one<00:02:34.590> exam<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> come<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.280> sneak<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.580> from

one exam be to come up and sneak up from

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.070 
one exam be to come up and sneak up from
behind<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.090> that's<00:02:36.510> why<00:02:36.630> usually<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.020> you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
behind you that's why usually if you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.000
