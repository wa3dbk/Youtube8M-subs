00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello girls how good this video 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.540
 I had not done it for a long time and see that 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.130
 I have products that I would not return to 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.300
 buy many I 've already got rid of 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.730
 them and then I should have done 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.960
 video before I get rid of them 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.460
 because now I do not remember but when 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.200
 I will try to do it because these videos 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.670
 They also serve a lot although you know 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.170
 that the opinions are very 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.730
 personal and what has gone wrong for me 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050
 you can do well for what you have 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 come well we can also go to 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.570
 you but good 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.100
 this video is about products that do not 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 would buy again and especially from 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.490
 good hair products what 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.130
 first you would not buy again if 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.900
 This l'Oréal shampoo is the mythical the 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.810
 shampoo and well it's supposed to be 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.820
 for all kinds of hair and I think it has 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.950
 argan oil and such I will read them a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 little nutrition shampoo the shine for 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 all kinds of hair enriched with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 argan oil just what I said 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.330
 and of such cotton seeds so 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.420
 bright and soft to the touch 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.430
 Well, I took this to very good 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 price the truth in online cosmetics or 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 something no makeup or you speak 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 give up 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.159
 and well, thank God it came out 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.229
 pretty good price because the truth 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.880
 is that I did not like anything because it makes 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.800
 foam smells good like any other 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.050
 shampoo but for me it does not clean very well 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.670
 hair and I say good if you do not clean it 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.170
 very good but I leave it very nice then 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.550
 for special occasions although up to date 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 next I have to wash my hair what 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.140
 I will use but I'm not sorry it 's history 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.550
 decades that no longer used to talk 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.000
 in a hurry because always very with the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.980
 just time I'm going to calm down 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.840
 good and I said although the next day what 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.610
 I'm going to have dirty the same way 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.850
 Well, the brightness and the beauty of it 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.050
 to leave but it does not leave me clean 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.580
 everything and it does not leave me with brightness or 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.229
 I notice that I and I hydrate him a lot 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.850
 nothing oil in the mythical today that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.740
 I have yes that will already go out there in 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.000
 another video and you will have already seen it 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.440
 great and others that I have taken it in photos 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 but this I will not repeat it, not what 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.150
 I recommend and I do not know if I'll finish it or not 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.119
 I am finishing it or finishing it but it is 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.979
 costing a lot to use it in the summer 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.540
 it cost me so much because good one day 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.649
 I can pull with hair action that I do not 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.540
 I leave it very nice and as up to date 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.890
 next I went to the pool and so on 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.440
 I was trying to wait in the winter 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.690
 have to wash melo díaz and díaz also 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.730
 I do not like it and if I used this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.680
 I would have to do then I bought it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.240
 by recommendation of beautiful and not to 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.520
 It is pretty or so I think 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.680
 and well, I know that other people 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.170
 it's fine but not me and I do not 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 I recommend today - for greasy hair other 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.500
 thing that I would not buy again is this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.630
 thermal protector of deliplus that I already 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.060
 I'll leave it protective of the heat for 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.860
 when he uses my dryer and iron and that's 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 deliplus I'm going to leave it here for 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.170
 see if I spend it or it will not be here 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.540
 I know it's a fingerprint, it does not dirty the hair but 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.340
 I do not know if it protects him then 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.020
 prefer to use other products that also 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.140
 To protect myself from the heat, do others 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.930
 objects such as nourish give shine 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 and things like that because in the end I 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.610
 forget to give it to me and I do not know if it protects me 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260
 well and it's not a product that then I 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.390
 forget to give it to him if he does not make me others 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.490
 effects beyond protecting from heat 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.900
 another thing that he will not buy again is 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.250
 I 'm going to throw it away 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.840
 now it is therefore shine diamond is 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.780
 of deliplus also of mercadona 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.450
 recover your natural shine revitalizes the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.980
 hair and regains its splendor this is 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.340
 an oil that neither nourishes nor is anything oil 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.709
 it smells very good yes 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.540
 it smells like total perfume I do not know if you have 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.140
 I smell this because there is also lacquer and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.000
 I know what else and it 's oil but it's not a 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.370
 oil like the ones that I can give 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.170
 argan oil or such in pointed media 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.730
 this is not this oil that neither nourishes you 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.940
 or nothing is supposed to be just to give 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.160
 shine and what it gives you then it is oil 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.340
 Fat in your hair gets dirty and shine 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.780
 for me it does not smell very good that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.170
 it smells great I would use it as 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.810
 perfume look 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.550
 because it smells great but that 's a 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.650
 product that for me the only thing that contributes 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.480
 It is embers to but then another thing that does not 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.099
 will go back to buy are the lacquers of is a 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.810
 Sil has already bought several other 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.270
 had before this was the orange 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.340
 this one in particular is the durable fixation 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.440
 natural movement and the orange with this 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.940
 strong and orange I do not know if it's the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.790
 strong or something like that 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.230
 well the effect that I still make 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.910
 use for this type of pigtails for 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.590
 hit me that I stay here dangerous and 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.810
 Outside it is the only thing I use 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.610
 for the loose hair prosecuted lacquer and good 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.020
 for that, he makes me the solution that I already 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.580
 tomorrow I would have to wash my head 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.169
 when you use installed you are left 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.570
 stiff and even if you comb it the hair is 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.010
 dirty then I 'm like I only use it for 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.600
 study the next day I vary the 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.850
 head because I'm already looking at it 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.160
 I do not care, but what I do not like 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.620
 is that I'm not going to make happy because I do not 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.050
 I pringar but soon after 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.880
 use it I always get shotgun no longer 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.190
 it goes well like that but it goes out to one side 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.100
 it is around here turning around and it has happened to me 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.050
 already with two or three lacquers of these so 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.760
 I will not repeat good and nothing until here 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.990
 video I hope the background good what 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.520
 put now like this a little bit quickly and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.639
 running to see how it is with 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.530
 a white background 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.889
 and I like it with a clear background because 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.180
 I'll put something lighter with some ornament or 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.560
 ironed because to see I do not know if what 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.659
 you will notice but is not taking advantage of 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.520
 likes and standing running and well I already 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.919
 you will say if the colors look better if I 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
 you see better me clearer and talca see if 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.430
 you like this background more than the orange and 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.240
 nothing else becomes very strong and see you 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.240
 in the next goodbye
