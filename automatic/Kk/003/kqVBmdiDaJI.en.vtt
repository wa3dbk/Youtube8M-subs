Hello!

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:05.600
Today we are going to play with Mellchan House.

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:08.488
Okay, let's open this!

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:17.777
You can open this from this side…okay.

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:37.777
And like so…take this out..

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.644
This should be later...

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:48.111
Wow!

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.511

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.844
Let's put this door too.

Oh, she went in.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.200
Don't you need a door?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.822

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.222
Please put on the door.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.777
How do I put these together?

00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:33.222
You should put them on the white one.

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:45.800
You have to put the roof too.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.066
It's roof.
We have to put the roof to prevent the rain.

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.444
Let's set batteries!

00:01:56.555 --> 00:02:01.466

Let's open the fridge!

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.750
