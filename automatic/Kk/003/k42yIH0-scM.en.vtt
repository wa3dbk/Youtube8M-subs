go<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.580> grocery<00:04:25.850> store<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.180> all<00:04:26.300> looks<00:04:26.510> just

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
go the grocery store that all looks just

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.030 
go the grocery store that all looks just
like<00:04:26.810> how<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.020> pictured<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.860> stuff

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
like how I pictured it all the stuff

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.520 
like how I pictured it all the stuff
they<00:04:28.190> do<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.270> way<00:04:29.360> Margo's<00:04:29.780> room<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.440> how

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
they do the way Margo's room is and how

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.380 
they do the way Margo's room is and how
he<00:04:30.590> finds<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.040> clues<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.490> it's<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:32.240> it

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
he finds the clues and it's like that it

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.210 
he finds the clues and it's like that it
looks<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.080> similar<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.500> what<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.800> was<00:04:34.010> imagining

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
looks so similar to what I was imagining

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.580 
looks so similar to what I was imagining
in<00:04:34.520> my<00:04:34.550> head<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.090> I'm<00:04:35.270> very<00:04:35.600> happy<00:04:36.050> about<00:04:36.200> that

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
in my head so I'm very happy about that

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.020 
in my head so I'm very happy about that
I<00:04:36.890> don't<00:04:37.040> really<00:04:37.190> have<00:04:37.370> anything<00:04:37.640> bad<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.880> say

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
I don't really have anything bad to say

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.330 
I don't really have anything bad to say
except<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.960> fact<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:39.320> I'm<00:04:39.650> hoping<00:04:40.070> that

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
except for the fact that I'm hoping that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.900 
except for the fact that I'm hoping that
Kara<00:04:40.760> does<00:04:41.419> Margo<00:04:41.780> justice<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.790> yeah<00:04:43.790> I'm

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
interested to see how the movies going

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.870 
interested to see how the movies going
to<00:04:45.560> end<00:04:45.800> if<00:04:46.039> they're<00:04:46.190> maybe<00:04:46.340> going<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.640> change

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
to end if they're maybe going to change

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.400 
to end if they're maybe going to change
it<00:04:46.970> up<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.120> little<00:04:47.150> bit<00:04:47.419> like<00:04:47.600> if<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.140> saw<00:04:48.350> The

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
it up a little bit like if you saw The

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.659 
it up a little bit like if you saw The
Fault<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:48.770> Our<00:04:48.860> Stars<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.370> know

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
Fault in Our Stars you know

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.580 
Fault in Our Stars you know
the<00:04:49.789> movie<00:04:50.030> ended<00:04:50.389> slightly<00:04:50.960> different<00:04:51.319> than

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
the movie ended slightly different than

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.689 
the movie ended slightly different than
the<00:04:52.069> book<00:04:52.219> it<00:04:52.340> didn't<00:04:52.520> really<00:04:52.610> change

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
the book it didn't really change

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.159 
the book it didn't really change
anything<00:04:53.180> about<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.569> movie<00:04:53.749> but<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:53.990> was<00:04:54.080> just

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
anything about the movie but it was just

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.980 
anything about the movie but it was just
a<00:04:54.319> little<00:04:54.560> tiny<00:04:54.860> twist<00:04:55.249> that<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.990> movie

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
a little tiny twist that the movie

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.540 
a little tiny twist that the movie
people<00:04:57.199> decided<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.800> throw<00:04:58.039> on<00:04:58.219> there<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:58.520> I

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
people decided to throw on there so I

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.320 
people decided to throw on there so I
wonder<00:04:58.789> if<00:04:58.849> they're<00:04:58.939> going<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.180> be<00:04:59.270> doing

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
wonder if they're going to be doing

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.510 
wonder if they're going to be doing
anything<00:04:59.599> like<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.840> for<00:05:00.259> Paper<00:05:00.800> Towns<00:05:01.009> I'd

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
anything like that for Paper Towns I'd

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.890 
anything like that for Paper Towns I'd
be<00:05:01.789> excited<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.210> see<00:05:02.240> but<00:05:02.449> it's<00:05:02.569> from<00:05:02.689> the<00:05:02.779> same

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
be excited to see but it's from the same

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.379 
be excited to see but it's from the same
producers<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.129> believe<00:05:04.430> as<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.759> whole<00:05:04.879> star<00:05:05.210> so

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
producers I believe as the whole star so

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.730 
producers I believe as the whole star so
I<00:05:05.599> guess<00:05:05.930> I'll<00:05:06.050> have<00:05:06.139> to<00:05:06.199> wait<00:05:06.379> and<00:05:06.439> see<00:05:06.650> about

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
I guess I'll have to wait and see about

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.140 
I guess I'll have to wait and see about
that<00:05:06.979> I<00:05:07.009> didn't<00:05:07.249> really<00:05:07.340> discuss<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.759> much<00:05:07.999> I

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
that I didn't really discuss it much I

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.040 
that I didn't really discuss it much I
don't<00:05:08.210> know<00:05:08.330> I've<00:05:08.449> never<00:05:08.659> really<00:05:08.870> done<00:05:09.020> this

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
