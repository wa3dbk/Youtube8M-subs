Dodge tool this way here and bring it
down<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.600> around<00:00:40.160> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

down to we want to just get around the
eye<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.520> way<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.780> probably

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
eye this way here so that's probably

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.279 
eye this way here so that's probably
good<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.420> simply

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
good and all we're going to do is simply

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.389 
good and all we're going to do is simply
click<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.450> brighten<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> eye<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:50.280> like

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
click and brighten up the eye just like

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.119 
click and brighten up the eye just like
that<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.440> brightens<00:00:52.980> up

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that so that just brightens up

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
that so that just brightens up
everything<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:54.149> revert<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
everything let's revert back to the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.130 
everything let's revert back to the
beginning<00:00:55.430> now<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:56.969> add<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.390> color<00:00:57.780> okay

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
beginning now let's add some color okay

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.110 
beginning now let's add some color okay
because<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> good<00:00:59.160> detail<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
because it's a good detail here but the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.459 
because it's a good detail here but the
eye<00:01:00.149> color<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> greatest<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.230> let's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
eye color is not the greatest so let's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
eye color is not the greatest so let's
pick<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> brush<00:01:02.030> try<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.390> kind

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pick a brush try to get that same kind

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
pick a brush try to get that same kind
of<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.589> again<00:01:04.799> create<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> new

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
of down or going again create a new

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.890 
of down or going again create a new
layer<00:01:06.170> let's<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> eyes<00:01:07.799> blue<00:01:08.900> this
