00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.310
 competitors

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.759
 now involves about twenty 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.759
 competitors 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.100

 bomb so we came for the wins and 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.520
 so it will be great fun 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 while the duo miranda and wendel 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.740

 all there the rising part to baila is 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.640
 a good train 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.299
 I hope his rocket will shut up if the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.299
 month of analyzed 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.260
 the eight men live the perfect love 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.210
 they do not leave each other except that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.820
 Vosgians passed in front of exactly 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.700
 we are a good group until we go down 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.990
 of these popes answer is there at the bottom 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.850
 then after there is dry cabinet in the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.370
 last few bumps and then 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.620
 the finish is really going to the bottom it's a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.780
 little descendants it rubs that nice I 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.600
 no big finish so bastien often 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.830
 best sprinters so we decided to 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.190
 put an attack in the last 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.400
 difficulty 3 km 3 4 kilometers from 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.400
 the arrival 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.480
 adrien mougel takes the broad direction 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.130
 the finish he passes the line to nothing before 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.669
 its pursuers the strategy has 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.959
 worked 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.959
 the Vosgians are victorious 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.680
 we had to fight to the end but 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.090
 we miss a little bit of success on the end 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.830
 a little misplaced on the end and that's 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 for that we finished 3rd but happy 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.690
 to attack promised knows the track and we 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.310
 follows all year round so knows the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.530
 every nook and cranny so that's I think a 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.130
 advantage is still a race that 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.750
 is long enough 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.890
 we still have not got the habit 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.390
 especially building that is still on the 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.130
 challenge nordic circuit and he has a little 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.000
 shocked cramps and in the end the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.440
 luckily he was there to 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.260
 take me to the finish because 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.110
 yeah I cracked when I had 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.150
 really bad paws is so good 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.960
 go on we finish we end not too far but 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.960
 hard enough
