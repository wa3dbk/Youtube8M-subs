00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:04.269 
my Google science fair project

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:06.360 
my Google science fair project
it's<00:00:04.660> an<00:00:04.809> autonomous<00:00:05.319> quadcopter<00:00:06.009> that's

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
it's an autonomous quadcopter that's

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.400 
it's an autonomous quadcopter that's
capable<00:00:06.609> of<00:00:06.910> mapping<00:00:07.299> its<00:00:07.419> environment<00:00:07.959> while

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
searching for a person all by itself I

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.530 
searching for a person all by itself I
started<00:00:11.800> this<00:00:11.920> project<00:00:12.220> March<00:00:12.910> of<00:00:13.150> last<00:00:13.330> year

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
started this project March of last year

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.019 
started this project March of last year
with<00:00:14.050> the<00:00:14.170> intent<00:00:14.590> of<00:00:14.710> designing<00:00:15.340> building

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
with the intent of designing building

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.960 
with the intent of designing building
and<00:00:16.059> programming<00:00:16.900> it<00:00:17.019> from<00:00:17.320> scratch<00:00:17.970> this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
and programming it from scratch this

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.810 
and programming it from scratch this
resulted<00:00:19.599> in<00:00:19.749> a<00:00:19.869> great<00:00:20.259> learning<00:00:20.499> experience

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
resulted in a great learning experience

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.909 
resulted in a great learning experience
these<00:00:21.820> at<00:00:22.089> the<00:00:22.210> time<00:00:22.480> I<00:00:22.749> began<00:00:23.109> this<00:00:23.289> project<00:00:23.529> I

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.819 
these at the time I began this project I
knew<00:00:24.369> very<00:00:24.400> little<00:00:24.820> about<00:00:25.239> design

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
knew very little about design

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.009 
knew very little about design
quadcopters<00:00:26.829> and<00:00:27.039> programming<00:00:27.609> I<00:00:28.019> went

quadcopters and programming I went

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.470 
quadcopters and programming I went
