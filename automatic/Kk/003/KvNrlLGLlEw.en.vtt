00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.620
 from home twist a gastronomic proposal 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.070
 of medieval cuisine 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.080
 a gastronomic proposal that brings us back to the pig 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.249
 the pork was definitely 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.300
 one of the most sated animals in the gastronomy of those times 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 the pork which was certainly food 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.980
 rt 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.509
 for knights for example 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.849
 sometimes it was also polenta food and that's what we want today 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 to point out is a proposal that used a less noble part of the pig 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.370
 we are used to seeing ham 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.490
 but much more rarely we are used to seeing this piece 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 which is practically the pig's cheek 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 elsewhere they call it the bill on the belly 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.660
 in our part here in the territory of you can call it once 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.940
 pig wash serves to prepare 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.670
 a very rustic dish 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.539
 a dish that certainly was made in the medieval period 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.250
 frame member 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.370
 that i am 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 now only by cutting in. &amp; games 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.010
 garlic in abundance 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.360
 why 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.250
 the name of this dish is high fellay iata facts 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 effusive laid 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.360
 what dominates and also why we must remember frame is a food 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.119
 very interesting for our life we ​​all know 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.320
 than the responsibility of lowering blood pressure 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 this yo will have to be 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.070
 it must be as they say 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.320
 browned lately king 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.080
 today it is used 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.190
 a lot to do these things 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 olive oil in the Middle Ages olive oil was not for everyone but 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.280
 not even of the gentlemen 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340
 and that's why we 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.970
 to last this garlic in a pan 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.900
 strive 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.859
 the destroyed pig 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:14.939
 the pork dress in the Middle Ages was widely used in all dishes I would say not 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.429
 just to fry 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.099
 but also in soups 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.670
 and even there were those who spread it on bread 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.149
 after this golden idiocy 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:31.609
 we go to slice very thin and very his map 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.239
 our vote 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.669
 and we take these slices we issue 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.079
 to cook 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 together with this one in Lucca the golden one 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.999
 with a 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.449
 red digo 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.899
 quantity 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.269
 of lard of pork we mix continuously 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.139
 and we await the canonical moment 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.779
 which is where 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.569
 this week they said they must be very thin 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.609
 become transparent 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.479
 this is the moment when we take another very poor product 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.259
 wine vinegar 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:16.079
 in this case it is a choice of white wine other times it will be wine vinegar 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:16.929
 red 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.849
 and let's fade very energetically 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.509
 once shaded 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.549
 our aiata is ready 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.569
 for your table 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.849
 has already prepared me a 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.599
 to show how it looks 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.119
 there is no need to salt and because we do not repeat this part of the pig - 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.039
 noble 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:45.629
 it was preserved in salt as is done for the shoulder or for the ham of 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.679
 pig 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:47.580
 and therefore 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.909
 eh already enriched with painted Christmas 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.519
 the regatta 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.059
 a delicacy is truly a delicacy that not only reminds us of the past 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.819
 not only does it remind us 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.809
 who unfortunately was 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.919
 used to eating poor things 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.129
 never reminds us that in the Middle Ages 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.149
 some things really were 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.069
 from large kitchen 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.019
 so here is an interesting proposal 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620
 a proposal that allows us 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.460
 to use bray and we remember it lario and a very good one 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.800
 ingredient for our arterial perception 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.580
 allows us to use a piece - noble pig 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.849
 and therefore this is one of the proposals 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.669
 cifa is waiting for the next one
