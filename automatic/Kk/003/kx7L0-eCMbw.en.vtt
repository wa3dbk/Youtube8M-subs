this<00:00:24.510> vehicle<00:00:25.160> before<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.400> ahead<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.880> our

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
this vehicle before we go ahead and our

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060 
this vehicle before we go ahead and our
new<00:00:27.779> radiator<00:00:28.109> must<00:00:28.470> still<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.890> box

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
