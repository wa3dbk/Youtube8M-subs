 I knew why they had the boxes 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.359

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.109
 even though his motorcycle that I started 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.220
 I started and is not very difficult to 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.210
 Make your code at the time of editing 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.630
 but it's a great job despite 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 appeal the one who did it here are the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.229

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.399
 we have a book 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.700
 we are going to continue teaching because it continues 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.250
 teaching 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.729
 and good guys can that in the take 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.930
 grade each time the Christmas special and 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.930
 they end up having time for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.340
 please because thanks to give him sight 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 and then when I was going to record there's no need 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.160
 touching it here is what is the items of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.160
 decoration yes I think so 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.830
 tools 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.140
 and food and good is not something that I know 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.909
 here is the saddle if you 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 we put a power that if left 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.650
 distributions that you put a pig 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 ah 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.460
 get here we put ourselves in the cane 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.050
 with carrot 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.050
 they are not ready 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 Pakistan 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 and where is the pig 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.530
 sing 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 because I think that this axis 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.750
 so when we are going to be able to 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.090
 ride the pig good because true 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.300
 Well, this video in this one 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.349
 they also have class recipes for 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.750
 example the lighter and the recipe 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.209
 I think it would be all for this video this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:22.370
 as a special Christmas inequality and 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.989
