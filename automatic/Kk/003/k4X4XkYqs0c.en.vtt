using correct proportions and how to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.880 
using correct proportions and how to
find<00:00:05.700> that<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:05.970> every<00:00:06.299> face<00:00:06.509> all<00:00:07.500> right<00:00:07.589> so<00:00:07.830> I'm

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
find that in every face all right so I'm

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.259

going<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> show<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.760> start<00:00:09.150> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
going to show you how to start a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.820 
going to show you how to start a
portrait<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.469> need<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.710> know

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
portrait and what you need to know

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.330 
portrait and what you need to know
proportion<00:00:11.400> wise<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:12.450> how<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> get<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.049> right

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
proportion wise is how to get it right

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
proportion wise is how to get it right
now<00:00:14.340> when<00:00:14.820> you're<00:00:14.969> doing<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> portrait<00:00:15.619> it's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
now when you're doing a portrait it's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980 
now when you're doing a portrait it's
very<00:00:16.980> important<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> exact<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.750> it's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
very important to get it exact if it's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.840 
very important to get it exact if it's
off<00:00:19.140> by<00:00:19.380> even<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.859> centimeter<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.520> not<00:00:20.670> gonna

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
off by even a centimeter it's not gonna

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.400 
off by even a centimeter it's not gonna
look<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.750> person<00:00:21.960> you're<00:00:22.140> trying<00:00:22.230> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
look like the person you're trying to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.859 
look like the person you're trying to
paint<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> whole<00:00:24.600> point<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
paint and that is the whole point of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
paint and that is the whole point of
giving<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.140> portrait<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> goes

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
giving a portrait now it kind of goes

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.580 
giving a portrait now it kind of goes
against<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> best<00:00:30.810> way<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> look<00:00:31.439> at

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
against that but the best way to look at

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
against that but the best way to look at
this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> face<00:00:33.360> if

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this is to not think of it as a face if

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
this is to not think of it as a face if
it's<00:00:34.140> easier<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> always<00:00:35.280> flip

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it's easier for you you can always flip

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.660 
it's easier for you you can always flip
the<00:00:35.610> painting<00:00:35.910> upside<00:00:36.239> down<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.430> suddenly<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the painting upside down and suddenly it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510 
the painting upside down and suddenly it
became<00:00:38.940> shapes<00:00:39.360> rather<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:40.050> features<00:00:40.530> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
became shapes rather than features but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
became shapes rather than features but
for<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> show<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> easy

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
for now I'm going to show you the easy

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.750 
for now I'm going to show you the easy
way<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.640> let's<00:00:47.640> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
way to think about it which is let's see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.500 
way to think about it which is let's see
it'll<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> easier<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.840> face<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it'll be easier to show you face on so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.910 
it'll be easier to show you face on so
everybody<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> head<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.340> course<00:00:54.800> kind<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
everybody has a head of course kind of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.470 
everybody has a head of course kind of
oval<00:00:56.219> II<00:00:58.100> now<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.670> they're<00:00:59.910> looking<00:01:00.210> straight

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
oval II now if they're looking straight

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
oval II now if they're looking straight
on<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.590> pretend<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> line

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
on at you just pretend there's a line

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.210 
on at you just pretend there's a line
going<00:01:02.579> down<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.860> cut<00:01:05.070> right

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
going down here and then cut right

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
going down here and then cut right
through<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> middle<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.479> where<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
through the middle and we have where the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.480 
through the middle and we have where the
eyes<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.580> right<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> middle<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:11.280> we

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
eyes go right in the middle then if we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.960 
eyes go right in the middle then if we
pretend<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> line<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> eyes

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
pretend this is the line of eyes

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
pretend this is the line of eyes
everything<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> head<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> measured

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
everything on the head can be measured

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.120 
everything on the head can be measured
in<00:01:16.590> eye<00:01:16.860> widths<00:01:17.460> there's<00:01:18.060> usually<00:01:18.830> five<00:01:19.830> eye

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
in eye widths there's usually five eye

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
in eye widths there's usually five eye
widths<00:01:20.520> across<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> eyes<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.450> course

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
widths across for the eyes so of course

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.310 
widths across for the eyes so of course
I'm<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.080> measuring<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:26.100> technically<00:01:27.320> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I'm not measuring very technically but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
I'm not measuring very technically but
you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.070> picture<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> measure

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you can get out your picture and measure

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
you can get out your picture and measure
the<00:01:30.360> length<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.840> eye<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the length of one eye and then take that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
the length of one eye and then take that
all<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.490> across<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
all the way across and that's going to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170 
all the way across and that's going to
give<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.920> length<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.460> face<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.970> your

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
give you the length of your face on your

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.859 
give you the length of your face on your
painting<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> eyes<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
painting so here we have the eyes if you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.359 
painting so here we have the eyes if you
cut<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.200> face<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.860> half<00:01:41.280> again<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.220> the

this<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.490> extremely<00:02:08.940> proportional

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
this is on an extremely proportional

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.110 
this is on an extremely proportional
person<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.350> what<00:02:11.160> makes<00:02:11.370> everybody<00:02:11.700> unique

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
person and what makes everybody unique

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.380 
person and what makes everybody unique
is<00:02:12.410> how<00:02:13.730> different<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.850> are<00:02:14.880> from<00:02:15.210> these

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is how different they are from these

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.470 
is how different they are from these
exact<00:02:15.720> proportions<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.210> least<00:02:18.240> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
exact proportions but this is at least a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810 
exact proportions but this is at least a
good<00:02:18.630> guideline<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.250> top<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
good guideline and now the top of the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.750 
good guideline and now the top of the
ears<00:02:21.090> usually<00:02:21.690> go<00:02:21.900> from<00:02:22.260> eyebrows<00:02:22.950> down<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760

have this off of this person who's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.910 
have this off of this person who's
really<00:02:28.320> long<00:02:28.560> years<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.220> okay<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.440> fun

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
really long years so that's okay the fun

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.680 
really long years so that's okay the fun
little<00:02:32.070> measurements<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:35.270> these<00:02:36.270> guys<00:02:36.510> right

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
little measurements are these guys right

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.530 
little measurements are these guys right
here<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.470> cut<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.640> middle<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> people

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
here if you cut the middle of the people

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
here if you cut the middle of the people
down<00:02:41.959> if<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.080> where<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> corner<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.950> the

down if you have where the corner of the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.560 
down if you have where the corner of the
mouth<00:02:44.250> usually<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:46.490> if<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.640> go<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> inside

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
mouth usually is if you go to the inside

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.010 
mouth usually is if you go to the inside
corner<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.140> eye<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.750> where<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
corner of the eye you have where the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.520 
corner of the eye you have where the
outside<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> nostrils<00:02:53.160> usually<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.760> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
outside of the nostrils usually go and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.840 
outside of the nostrils usually go and
to<00:02:55.530> make<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.400> all<00:02:56.550> fairly

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
to make sure that this is all fairly

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.480 
to make sure that this is all fairly
proportional<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.930> draw<00:02:58.140> an<00:02:58.890> exact

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
proportional you can draw an exact

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.640 
proportional you can draw an exact
triangle<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.190> matches<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:03.650> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
triangle and if it all matches up you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.330 
triangle and if it all matches up you
know<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.950> you're<00:03:05.040> on<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.310> track<00:03:07.340> so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
know that you're on the right track so

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920 
know that you're on the right track so
these<00:03:08.519> are<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:08.820> little<00:03:09.060> things<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.900> make

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
these are just little things to make

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.440 
these are just little things to make
sure<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.850> you're<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.209> direction

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
sure that you're in the right direction

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
sure that you're in the right direction
if<00:03:13.050> you're<00:03:13.440> getting<00:03:13.680> lost

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
if you're getting lost

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.150 
if you're getting lost
this<00:03:14.550> works<00:03:14.850> exact<00:03:15.209> same<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.600> sideways<00:03:16.160> this

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
this works exact same way sideways this

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.380 
this works exact same way sideways this
is<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> painting<00:03:17.790> I'm<00:03:17.880> going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.180> showing

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
is the painting I'm going to be showing

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.210 
is the painting I'm going to be showing
you<00:03:18.570> how<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.720> use<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> same<00:03:19.830> here

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
you how to use but it's the same here

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.330 
you how to use but it's the same here
I'll<00:03:20.760> usually<00:03:21.030> use<00:03:21.450> my<00:03:21.630> brush<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.920> form<00:03:23.250> of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I'll usually use my brush as a form of

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.979 
I'll usually use my brush as a form of
measurement<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.209> take<00:03:24.390> one<00:03:24.630> eye<00:03:24.660> length

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
measurement so I can take one eye length

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.190 
measurement so I can take one eye length
here<00:03:25.940> when<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> link<00:03:27.330> there<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.780> then<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.110> know

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
here when I link there and then I know

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.380 
here when I link there and then I know
that<00:03:28.440> her<00:03:28.530> other<00:03:28.769> eye<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.459> gonna<00:03:29.760> start<00:03:30.090> right

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
that her other eye is gonna start right

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.350 
that her other eye is gonna start right
about<00:03:30.510> there

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.200 

I<00:03:34.420> can<00:03:35.080> take<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> inside<00:03:35.860> of<00:03:36.010> her<00:03:36.190> people<00:03:36.460> and

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
I can take the inside of her people and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.000 
I can take the inside of her people and
yep<00:03:37.390> that's<00:03:38.110> right<00:03:38.290> where<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.590> corner<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:38.950> her

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
yep that's right where the corner of her

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.450 
yep that's right where the corner of her
mouth<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:41.230> corner<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.650> her<00:03:41.740> eye<00:03:41.770> bring<00:03:42.370> it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
mouth is the corner of her eye bring it

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.490 
mouth is the corner of her eye bring it
down<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:43.480> that's<00:03:43.750> exactly<00:03:44.080> where<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
down and that's exactly where the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.890 
down and that's exactly where the
outside<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.950> her<00:03:45.040> nostril<00:03:45.460> is<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.690> can<00:03:46.870> use

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
outside of her nostril is so you can use

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.300 
outside of her nostril is so you can use
all<00:03:47.080> these<00:03:47.230> measurements<00:03:47.770> no<00:03:47.890> matter<00:03:48.070> what

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
all these measurements no matter what

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.720 
all these measurements no matter what
angle<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.640> faces<00:03:49.150> if<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:49.660> up<00:03:49.840> down<00:03:49.870> sideways

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
angle the faces if it's up down sideways

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.180 
angle the faces if it's up down sideways
this<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.150> help<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.950> stay<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> little

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
this is going to help you stay a little

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.940 
this is going to help you stay a little
bit<00:03:54.340> more<00:03:54.460> correct
