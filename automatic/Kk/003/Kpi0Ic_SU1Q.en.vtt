 I bring you the games and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.189
 applications found on February 7 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.200
 of 2014 so well let's go to 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.849
 start quickly remember to support us 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.800

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.260
 thumb up sharing this video and 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.269
 with all that you always do so that 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.949
 let's continue with this series of videos many 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.100
 thanks for the support of the videos 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.580
 past of this series good we find 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.350
 a fast word on hd stone stage more to 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.140
 good is for iphone and for ipad but it 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.879
 sees a lot better on ipad which is what 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 you have to do simply you're going to have 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.520
 to have as a kind of puzzle already 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.440
 see that this puzzle comes out every 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.820
 kind of medium rare scenario and this what 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.129
 you're going to do this you have to put them together 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.890
 the blocks that are arriving 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.559
 of the same color and with the same figures 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.870
 or that entertained to a certain extent 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.140
 but until then there is no greater 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.750
 we found pdf converter pro as its 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.880
 name tells us let's be able to see let's 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.450
 to be able to create and we will be able to download 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.320
 pdf is to our compatible device 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.540
 with all the devices there 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.580
 ok I have always said 100% 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.430
 recommended to have a device 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.140
 good a pdf application since I never 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.290
 we know when we can occupy it 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.479
 we also find a real clive this is 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.890
 Well I liked the truth that is what 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.400
 you have to do you just have to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.470
 do nothing else but level 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.590
 of with difficulty levels are like 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.180
 amateur dives I like the truth that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.729
 It's pretty good, pretty entertaining 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.900
 sometimes it's quite complicated to start 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.670
 do the dives as you go 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.070
 advancing of levels they ask you with more 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.050
 difficulty but in itself quite enough 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.500
 good we also find to the one of the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.440
 power rangers this surprised me when 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.470
 I saw him this until I started laughing 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.869
 download has very good gameplay is 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.020
 pretty much the infinity blade style 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.509
 but very good graphics good 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.640
 gameplay I was quite surprised 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
 it surprised for good to download it to see 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 if you like it like I always tell them 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.010
 if you do not like it then it does not happen 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.300
 absolutely nothing you delete it and ready 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.760
 we also found that kidman cure 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.920
 This will be like a game 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.770
 mental ability to learn to add to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.230
 subtract to divide itself so you can 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.450
 improve your math 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.080
 this application I 've seen a lot now 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.930
 in this in elementary schools I've 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.480
 seen a lot when they give the children 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.490
 this the ipads and they start to play with 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.960
 this is a way of learning by playing if 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 you have children this can serve you 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.460
 very much since you can do it 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.050
 fun and dynamic, I really believe 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.120
 that if it can serve you enough if 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.370
 you have children we also found the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.250
 alone in the clock in good the game 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.110
 This is one of the best I've played with 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.990
 a little bit of strategy with a little 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.790
 of suspense with a little bit of everything 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.550
 liked the truth maybe you have moving forward 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.700
 of the levels I like, it's pretty 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.310
 good 100% recommended we found 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.890
 play this game because it enters the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.450
 category of children's games and it is 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.640
 very simple you can create your own 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.950
 very basic racing tracks 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.380
 logically you can say create your 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 own little monkeys to go 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.870
 driving and then itself is for you to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.879
 have fun 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.250
 children the truth that is quite a father 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.739
 game from the best ones scored in the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.239
 itunes store we found plants vs 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.909
 zombies 2 seems to me that it is always 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.980
 been free but good now with 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.650
 your latest update has added 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.950
 many levels but also many 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.690
 report failures that are created and the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.159
 device is something that you try it to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.500
 see if it works for you with the last 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.290
 update we also find a star 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.970
 wars tiny the stars this one has also 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.069
 been several times free which is what 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.079
 you have to do it because you simply have 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.900
 have to go through the levels and 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.239
 missions as they ask you ok 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.730
 this because the pixelated style there is a 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.079
 lego style pretty much 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.540
 good entertaining the game up 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.900
 certain point but it does not happen to major 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.229
 we also found public esports 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.329
 This is going to be like a sports magazine 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.669
 good good 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.060
 but like I need a little bit I do not know 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.580
 how it becomes very monotonous no no 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.860
 they update very often by saying it of a 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.870
 mode all the news even though 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.960
 you connect to internet you need internet 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.560
 to be able to occupy this application but 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.849
 I do not know how I feel that he is missing 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.310
 some be a little more news 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.310
 but the application itself is good 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.379
 we found a new republic also going to 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.509
 to pass the same thing is the same creator 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.659
 more than this because it is already dedicated to 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.639
 news in general no longer sports 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.919
 same good but the same thing happens 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.340
 internet and as they are not updated 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.800
 immediately like you need a 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.870
 little bit of maintenance I think 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.360
 no but principles is good in the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.969
 Czech application we found it to modern 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.949
 Fight as his name tells us 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.819
 we're going to have to make a game of 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.830
 war 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.990
 you have to have planes have tanks 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.969
 have robots question everything a little 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.159
 so that your civilization does not destroy you 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.440
 to me this kind of games does not call me 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.210
 so much attention would I give to this 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.150
 game like a 7 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.650
 entertaining but it does not happen to majors that 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.080
 it's not something you say or even 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.240
 love and it's something that is what 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.910
 better than I've tried we also found 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.680
 a flick champions winter sports 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.030
 what do you have to do with this 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.280
 unique good game that you have to do 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.789
 with this game is that we will have as 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.849
 are all this all sports 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.430
 winter then somehow but in your 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.590
 device is pretty good enough 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.300
 well accomplished very addictive if you like them 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.509

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.520
 is for you have enough this games and 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.039

 multiplayer option and be 100% 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.050
 recommended and good to finish 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.509
 we found the faa mike fergus 13 this 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.310
 is going to be productivity but for a 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.620
 company if you have your own company 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.659
 this can serve you enough you can see 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.360
 you can create your inventory you can see 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.240

 electronic ones to know that it is quite 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.500
 interesting the application if you have your
