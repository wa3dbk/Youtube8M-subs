around<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.870> corner<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.410> thought<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.219> was

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
around the corner I thought that it was

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.209 
around the corner I thought that it was
time<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> dust<00:00:57.270> off<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.510> copy<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.079> bad<00:00:58.980> company

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
time to dust off my copy of bad company

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.360 
time to dust off my copy of bad company
2<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> get<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> battlefield<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.370> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
2 and get back to the battlefield and I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
2 and get back to the battlefield and I
played<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> couple<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.120> games<00:01:03.180> earlier<00:01:03.870> today

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
field feeling in there we all know that

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.250 
field feeling in there we all know that
they're<00:03:56.430> going<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.880> try<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.480> sue<00:03:57.750> part<00:03:58.140> of

Calvary's market but you don't make a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.110 
Calvary's market but you don't make a
better<00:04:00.930> game<00:04:01.170> by<00:04:01.800> imitating<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.730> one<00:04:02.910> that

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
better game by imitating the one that

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.300 
better game by imitating the one that
you're<00:04:03.269> trying<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> differentiate

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
you're trying to differentiate

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.530 
you're trying to differentiate
differentiate<00:04:05.310> from<00:04:05.340> that's<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.420> long

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
differentiate from that's really long

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140 
differentiate from that's really long
sentence<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.260> came<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.560> pretty<00:04:07.739> well<00:04:08.150> my

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
sentence but it came out pretty well my

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.180 
sentence but it came out pretty well my
guess<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.720> players<00:04:10.200> are<00:04:10.500> looking<00:04:10.890> for

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
guess is that players are looking for

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.920 
guess is that players are looking for
something<00:04:11.520> fresh<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.150> new<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.450> they

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
something fresh and new and they

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.600 
something fresh and new and they
definitely<00:04:13.200> don't<00:04:13.710> want<00:04:13.980> anything<00:04:14.340> that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
definitely don't want anything that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.039 
definitely don't want anything that
resembles<00:04:15.090> something<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.870> has<00:04:16.019> been

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
resembles something that has been

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.620 
resembles something that has been
overcooked<00:04:16.769> for<00:04:17.070> over<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.880> dozen<00:04:18.120> times<00:04:18.330> now

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
overcooked for over a dozen times now

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.620 
overcooked for over a dozen times now
and<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.380> game<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> coming<00:04:19.860> too<00:04:20.160> close<00:04:20.420> yes<00:04:21.420> I

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630
