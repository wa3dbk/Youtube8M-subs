00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.699
 Hello everyone, Ilya Madison, how are you? 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.310
 my eyes are oppressive to me 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.180
 maddyblog and you expect a new month 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 I for a long time on it I hear the lingering 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 applause 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 some kind of fat lady's restrained joy 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:42.690
 throws me thongs smeared in 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 McDuck cheese sauce in general is all 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.010
 just great and i'm great yet 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.199
 this is what this discovery is crumbling like 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 damn stinky cottage fence now 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.250
 I will explain what happens in the first many 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 probably did not understand what kind of hero debility 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 video began with at least moronic 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 a screen saver which is not yet completely 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 mean can't but so i'm all 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.740
 I'll explain it here the other day about who with this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.720
 your anasha and asked antonio how 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 draw a screensaver for the show which 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.619
 will be called eagle in those snakes that my 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 what the fuck moved me 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.439
 it is absolutely impossible to explain because 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.659
 that I have a condition when the brain 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270
 absolutely not working in general seemed 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 good idea to create a game show with such 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 title because most gaming 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 shows are called like something like a game ass 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.619
 or play grease in general attempt to fuck 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.310
 words a game with another word and all this 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.899
 ridiculous 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.290
 no one has guessed to name your show 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.670
 an eagle in the shadow of a snake all the more intimate 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.799
 fucking eagle can not be in the shadow of a snake 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.390
 because the snake is crawling and it's all me 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.729
 it seemed so funny 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.470
 unblindly witty especially as in 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.020
 that day i watched the jackie chan movie 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.880
 accordingly than the name of the covenant snake 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.010
 was in the shadow of an eagle and the music is this 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.630
 we have the same intro music 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.950
 such as if someone gets and in general 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.390
 All very cool once I jump over 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 I really do not know really wanted such a show but 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.500
 the concept I never thought of so take 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.550
 and I need to fight more in this 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.580
 sandstorm 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.580
 and where is my second weapon to me she is 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.520
 I need serious problems 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.390
 run back and look for a gun which 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.620
 lay 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.550
 you will find behind this fence 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.460
 famas but all the famas guys are tough as you 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.890
 Namaz now I fucking punish you all for 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.970
 this garbage was not expected to be so 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.160
 tense 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.690
 honestly relaxed like to play 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.670
 and here but it does not work so long 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 In general, antonio clown asked me how 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.900
 i feel i'm not sick 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.400
 whether i really like the head 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.280
 idea of ​​such a name 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.120
 Well, the strains say only that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.090
 probably 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 than the new I will talk tomorrow but 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.000
 tomorrow he already threw me this screensaver and 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.950
 Now we have the birth I had 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 invite somewhere I invited here though 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.160
 no show I'm definitely not doing 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.050
 just play the game and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.130
 fucking I do not understand that with the same ps 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.400
 Navigator all pizdets still need 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.459
 go there I will not crawl through my fat 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.459
 ass fucking still some kind of crap 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.150
 I still can not understand and 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.450
 In general, in general, I pinned this 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.680
 finding here is that there will be in this month 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.680
 channel yes everything 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.620
 25 screen widths again garland sheikh you 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.920
 what else is it really not just about ebal 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 All grandmothers if I did what but how 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.500
 explain if this sandstorm 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.370
 was 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.080
 beer and food then I would have tasted it with my own 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.540
 mouth 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.550
 so this whole month has been the only 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.860
 that I never climbed into the pipe because 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.860
 as it is known there are people who sit on 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.770
 pipe that sit under the pipe is such 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.760
 how am I going to earn now 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.680
 on maddyblog channel regarding this 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.190
 games then this is specials and I am 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.530
 provided I play it I read on 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.590
 many forums and many cloaks the fact that 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.410
 it is undervalued by igroproma diamonds 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.000
 that this is one of the best games in terms of 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.580
 plot in general can be a little bit 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.070
 weak gameplay is written by people but for the sake of 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.890
 such a plot can and be patient 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.350
 because it is almost an apocalypse 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.360
 today in the world of computer games there is 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.910
 such a film apocalypse today with dad 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.919
 Charlie bus and he in my opinion enters 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.250
 the three most boring movies of all time 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.650
 and nations along with the play driver and 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.400
 spy go out what under these films 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.100
 just fall asleep and generally say 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.900
 dubai atmosphere fucking story 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.810
 must necessarily play himself. 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.870
 stupid joker here fucking is that 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.700
 just fucked up and impossible to break away from 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.400
 of the screen you look like an interactive film 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.500
 about fighters whose sand in the anus 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.720
 clogged they therefore take complex 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.000
 solutions are shorter what can I say for 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.000
 about this game right now I turned on 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.010
 do this review i can say i am 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.140
 I don't want to play anymore 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.990
 because me so zaebat gameplay 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.700
 this sad shit that no plot 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.770
 He is here in general, it is even possible 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.670
 interesting as far as i can tell 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.180
 the river at the end awaits me unexpected 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.880
 sheets turn but what a fucking dull 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.250
 then the gameplay you just fuck you 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.170
 for cover you shoot then you go fucking 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.860
 sit down for another shelter you shoot 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.530
 then fuck for another cover and so 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:21.110
 fucking three hundred years old I'm just so 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.110
 I'm tired when I bought them
