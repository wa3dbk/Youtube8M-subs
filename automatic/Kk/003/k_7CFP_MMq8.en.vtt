hi this dr. pan recording from Tucson

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.570 
hi this dr. pan recording from Tucson
Arizona<00:00:03.929> we're<00:00:04.589> picking<00:00:04.890> up<00:00:05.009> where<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.370> left

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
Arizona we're picking up where we left

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.330 
Arizona we're picking up where we left
off<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.029> part<00:00:06.390> one<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.589> looking<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:07.950> roots

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
off in part one we're looking for roots

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
off in part one we're looking for roots
for<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.790> polynomial<00:00:09.590> using<00:00:10.590> our<00:00:10.710> analogy

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
for this polynomial using our analogy

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.530 
for this polynomial using our analogy
we're<00:00:11.429> digging<00:00:11.730> them<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:11.969> truffles

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
we're digging them for truffles

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.289 
we're digging them for truffles
okay<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.349> part<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.009> left<00:00:14.219> off<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> P<00:00:15.030> Q

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
okay so part one we left off on the P Q

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.750 
okay so part one we left off on the P Q

once you have a first guess what you can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.130 
once you have a first guess what you can
do<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> rewrite<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.670> f<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.270> X<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.780> form

polynomial for our case it happened to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.150 
polynomial for our case it happened to
be<00:00:49.559> quadratic<00:00:50.719> because<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:52.260> reducing<00:00:52.710> power

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
of one from cube we can result in a
quadratic<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> use

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
quadratic and from here we can use

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.380 
quadratic and from here we can use
quadratic<00:01:01.640> formula<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.920> finish<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.939> rest<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

quadratic formula to finish the rest of
the<00:01:06.510> roots<00:01:06.720> okay<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> huge<00:01:08.070> lifesaver

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the roots okay this is a huge lifesaver

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600 
the roots okay this is a huge lifesaver
so<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.450> PQ<00:01:09.900> theorem<00:01:10.260> says<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:10.830> grab<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so this PQ theorem says look grab the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.890 
so this PQ theorem says look grab the
coefficient<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:13.189> P<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.520> Q<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.509> here's<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
coefficient of P over Q now here's the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.700 
coefficient of P over Q now here's the
interesting<00:01:16.200> part

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
interesting part

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.820 
interesting part
PQ<00:01:17.369> theorem<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> upset<00:01:18.479> dumb<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.409> think

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
PQ theorem is upset dumb in that think

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.020 
PQ theorem is upset dumb in that think
of<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.189> snake<00:01:20.640> okay<00:01:22.280> snake<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.580> don't<00:01:23.939> know

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of it as snake okay snake I don't know

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
of it as snake okay snake I don't know
how<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> snake<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.650> graph<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
how good the snake is you graph the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
how good the snake is you graph the
coefficient<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.509> bottom<00:01:27.869> forces<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
coefficient on the bottom forces this is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
coefficient on the bottom forces this is
actually<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> P<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> Q

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
actually the P part and this is the Q

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.810 
actually the P part and this is the Q
part<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> prints<00:01:31.799> follows<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> Queen

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
part so the prints follows the Queen

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.640 
part so the prints follows the Queen
okay<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.079> plus<00:01:35.070> minus<00:01:35.100> 4<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:37.159> all<00:01:38.159> its

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
okay so plus minus 4 and all its

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.060 
okay so plus minus 4 and all its
possible<00:01:41.000> factors<00:01:42.000> plus<00:01:42.450> minus<00:01:42.869> 2<00:01:43.110> plus<00:01:43.860> minus

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
possible factors plus minus 2 plus minus

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.660 
possible factors plus minus 2 plus minus
1<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.880> 4<00:01:45.240> has<00:01:45.649> possible<00:01:46.649> factors<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.430> 1

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
1 because 4 has possible factors of 1

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.139 
1 because 4 has possible factors of 1
and<00:01:48.060> 2<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.590> keel<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.280> minus<00:01:50.909> 2

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and 2 in there and the keel is minus 2

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810 
and 2 in there and the keel is minus 2
so<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.570> plus<00:01:51.899> minus<00:01:52.320> 1<00:01:52.649> plus<00:01:53.280> minus<00:01:53.399> 2

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so you have plus minus 1 plus minus 2

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
so you have plus minus 1 plus minus 2
okay<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:55.229> looks<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
okay that looks like a lot of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.179 
okay that looks like a lot of
possibilities<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.270> what's<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.110> alternative

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
possibilities but what's the alternative

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.530 
possibilities but what's the alternative
you're<00:01:59.189> gonna<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> look<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> entire

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you're gonna have to look at the entire

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
you're gonna have to look at the entire
set<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> numbers<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.729> infinite

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
set of numbers which is the infinite

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.660 
set of numbers which is the infinite
okay<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.560> our<00:02:04.979> list<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
okay this is actually our list is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.350 
okay this is actually our list is
limited<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:07.369> over<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> years<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.910> tell<00:02:09.209> my

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
limited so over the years I tell my

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.430 
limited so over the years I tell my
student<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> best<00:02:10.050> way<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.770> actually

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
student the best way you can actually

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.610 
student the best way you can actually
organize<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.450> write<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.900> out<00:02:14.020> P

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
organize it is this you write it out P

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.910 
organize it is this you write it out P
is<00:02:14.890> plus<00:02:15.220> minus<00:02:15.250> four<00:02:15.940> okay<00:02:16.690> plus<00:02:17.320> minus<00:02:17.710> 1

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
is plus minus four okay plus minus 1

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
is plus minus four okay plus minus 1
plus<00:02:18.430> minus<00:02:18.550> 2<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
plus minus 2 and that's it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.640 
plus minus 2 and that's it
okay<00:02:21.070> Q<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.120> side<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.690> have<00:02:22.900> plus<00:02:23.260> minus

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
okay Q on this side you have plus minus

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.840 
okay Q on this side you have plus minus
1<00:02:24.150> minus<00:02:25.150> 1<00:02:25.360> plus<00:02:25.870> minus<00:02:26.260> 1<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.800> then<00:02:27.520> for<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
1 minus 1 plus minus 1 and then for the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.630 
1 minus 1 plus minus 1 and then for the
second<00:02:28.240> setting<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.720> repeat<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:30.070> same<00:02:30.340> thing

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
second setting you repeat the same thing

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.950 
second setting you repeat the same thing
for<00:02:31.680> factors<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.920> P<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.690> plus

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
for factors of P and then you do plus

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.800 
for factors of P and then you do plus
minus<00:02:35.350> 2<00:02:35.590> mu<00:02:35.740> plus<00:02:36.010> minus<00:02:36.220> 2<00:02:36.670> plus<00:02:37.150> minus<00:02:37.330> 2<00:02:37.690> on

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
minus 2 mu plus minus 2 plus minus 2 on

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.290 
minus 2 mu plus minus 2 plus minus 2 on
this<00:02:37.960> side<00:02:38.020> because<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.950> Q<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.640> this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
this side because that's the Q and this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.830 
this side because that's the Q and this
would<00:02:40.660> reduce<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.700> set<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.270> what

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
would reduce you down to a set of what

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.890 
would reduce you down to a set of what
six<00:02:44.590> or<00:02:44.770> eight<00:02:44.980> numbers<00:02:45.460> plus<00:02:46.150> minus<00:02:46.570> four

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
six or eight numbers plus minus four

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.980 
six or eight numbers plus minus four
there's<00:02:47.770> one<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.160> them<00:02:48.340> plus<00:02:49.000> minus<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
there's one of them plus minus one is

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.470 
there's one of them plus minus one is
one<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.230> them<00:02:50.590> plus<00:02:51.310> minus<00:02:51.670> two<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:52.210> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
one of them plus minus two is one of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
one of them plus minus two is one of
them<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.320> one<00:02:53.590> give<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.860> plus<00:02:54.070> minus<00:02:54.490> 2

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
them this one give you plus minus 2

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.390 
them this one give you plus minus 2
again<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:55.330> don't<00:02:55.600> want<00:02:55.750> my<00:02:55.900> 1<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.710> plus<00:02:56.950> minus

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
again we don't want my 1 this plus minus

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.850 
again we don't want my 1 this plus minus
1<00:02:57.670> again<00:02:58.060> here's<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.720> unique<00:02:59.200> one<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.770> was

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
1 again here's a unique one that was

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.800 
1 again here's a unique one that was
just<00:02:59.980> plus<00:03:00.280> minus<00:03:00.670> 1/2

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
just plus minus 1/2

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.570 
just plus minus 1/2
okay<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.380> basically<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.340> eight

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
okay so basically we have eight

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.270 
okay so basically we have eight
possibilities<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:06.070> looks

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
possibilities to go so I know it looks

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.520 
possibilities to go so I know it looks
tedious<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:07.120> then<00:03:07.660> again<00:03:07.810> what's<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
tedious but then again what's the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.090 
tedious but then again what's the
alternative

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
alternative

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.790 
alternative
okay<00:03:09.670> infinite<00:03:10.270> versus<00:03:10.780> eight<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.290> would

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
okay infinite versus eight I would

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.160 
okay infinite versus eight I would
choose<00:03:12.010> eight<00:03:12.310> out<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.670> time<00:03:12.850> okay<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.990> our

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
choose eight out of time okay so our

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.310 
choose eight out of time okay so our
next<00:03:14.200> task<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.390> which<00:03:16.660> one<00:03:17.050> among

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
next task is to see which one among

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.220 
next task is to see which one among
those<00:03:17.739> eight<00:03:17.980> numbers<00:03:18.520> actually<00:03:19.090> give<00:03:19.690> me<00:03:19.989> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
those eight numbers actually give me a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.100 
those eight numbers actually give me a
root<00:03:20.739> okay<00:03:21.400> once<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.180> root<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.660> can

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
root okay once I have the root I can

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.260 
root okay once I have the root I can
figure<00:03:23.500> out<00:03:23.650> what<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> quadratic<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.090> my

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
figure out what the quadratic is so my

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.449 
figure out what the quadratic is so my
goal<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.900> rewrite<00:03:26.140> that's<00:03:26.620> complicated<00:03:27.100> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
goal is to rewrite that's complicated a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.720 
goal is to rewrite that's complicated a
polynomial<00:03:28.270> into<00:03:28.900> X<00:03:29.110> minus<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.890> root<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.340> find

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
polynomial into X minus this root I find

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.699 
polynomial into X minus this root I find
among<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.330> 8<00:03:31.480> choices<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:32.230> have<00:03:32.470> eight

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
among the 8 choices I have eight

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.570 
among the 8 choices I have eight
candidates<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.489> have<00:03:34.410> x<00:03:35.410> our<00:03:35.709> polynomial<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
candidates I have x our polynomial of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.880 
candidates I have x our polynomial of
order<00:03:37.060> two

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
order two

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.280 
order two
alright<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.160> let's<00:03:39.400> get<00:03:39.550> started<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:41.050> have

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
alright so let's get started you have

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.190 
alright so let's get started you have
method<00:03:42.000> one<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:44.500> can<00:03:44.709> use<00:03:44.739> long<00:03:45.340> division

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.400 

if<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.190> one<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.459> raise<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.880> hair<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.569> should<00:03:51.230> be

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
if this one I raise you hair I should be

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.809 
if this one I raise you hair I should be
it's<00:03:51.740> pretty<00:03:52.489> complicated<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.860> messy<00:03:54.860> mess

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
it's pretty complicated and messy mess

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.720 
it's pretty complicated and messy mess
it<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.270> you<00:03:57.080> can<00:03:57.349> use<00:03:57.730> evaluate<00:03:58.730> f<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.300> X<00:03:59.620> with<00:04:00.730> X

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
it to you can use evaluate f of X with X

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.260 
it to you can use evaluate f of X with X
equal<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.420> plus<00:04:02.720> minus<00:04:02.750> 4<00:04:03.470> plus<00:04:03.980> minus<00:04:04.370> 1<00:04:04.850> plus

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
equal to plus minus 4 plus minus 1 plus

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.470 
equal to plus minus 4 plus minus 1 plus
minus<00:04:05.390> 2<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:06.560> plus<00:04:06.709> minus<00:04:07.250> 1/2<00:04:07.670> which<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.209> not

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
minus 2 and plus minus 1/2 which is not

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.000 
minus 2 and plus minus 1/2 which is not
too<00:04:08.750> bad<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.290> little<00:04:09.770> work<00:04:10.069> Bettany

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
too bad it's little work Bettany

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.690 
too bad it's little work Bettany
something<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.100> can<00:04:13.250> handle

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
something you can handle

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.569 
something you can handle
okay<00:04:14.420> now<00:04:14.989> my<00:04:15.260> favorite<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.830> one<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.220> actually

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
okay now my favorite of one is actually

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.400 
okay now my favorite of one is actually
using<00:04:17.299> synthetic<00:04:18.230> division<00:04:19.900> okay<00:04:20.900> well<00:04:21.139> show

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
using synthetic division okay well show

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.969 
using synthetic division okay well show
this<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.919> with<00:04:22.790> one<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.270> them<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.780> maybe

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
this one with one of them so maybe

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.530 
this one with one of them so maybe
you'll<00:04:24.979> see<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.370> if<00:04:25.700> both<00:04:25.880> method<00:04:26.360> actually

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
you'll see that if both method actually

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.240 
you'll see that if both method actually
gave<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.169> same<00:04:27.380> thing<00:04:27.650> all<00:04:28.460> right

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
gave you the same thing all right

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.150 
gave you the same thing all right
synthetic<00:04:31.250> division<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:35.300> let's<00:04:35.510> try<00:04:35.780> one

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
synthetic division so let's try one

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.920 
synthetic division so let's try one
let's<00:04:37.160> see<00:04:37.400> X<00:04:37.940> equaled<00:04:38.389> 1<00:04:38.979> 1<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:41.210> I'll<00:04:41.419> see<00:04:41.660> if<00:04:41.780> X

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
let's see X equaled 1 1 so I'll see if X

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.610 
let's see X equaled 1 1 so I'll see if X
equal<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.440> 1<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:42.889> it's<00:04:43.190> X<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.330> 1<00:04:44.660> if<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.290> equal

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
equal to 1 if it's X of 1 if it's equal

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.890 
equal to 1 if it's X of 1 if it's equal
to<00:04:45.740> 0<00:04:45.979> then<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.760> means<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.240> route<00:04:47.450> for

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
to 0 then that means it's a route for

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.940 
to 0 then that means it's a route for
this<00:04:48.020> polynomial

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
this polynomial

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.580 
this polynomial
unfortunately<00:04:49.940> F<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.270> 1<00:04:50.630> if<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:50.990> plug<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.470> in

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
unfortunately F of 1 if you plug it in

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.300 
unfortunately F of 1 if you plug it in
there

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
there

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.210 
there
I<00:04:52.340> end<00:04:53.090> up<00:04:53.210> with<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.510> positive<00:04:53.750> 3<00:04:54.410> using

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
I end up with a positive 3 using

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.120 
I end up with a positive 3 using
synthetic<00:04:55.460> division<00:04:56.740> hopefully<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.950> know

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
synthetic division hopefully you know

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640 
synthetic division hopefully you know
how<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> do<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.760> one<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.360> don't<00:04:59.660> go<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:00.500> my

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
how to do this one if you don't go on my

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710 
how to do this one if you don't go on my
channel<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.370> type<00:05:01.700> in<00:05:01.910> synthetic<00:05:02.270> division

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
channel and type in synthetic division

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.370 
channel and type in synthetic division
there<00:05:03.260> should<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:06.250> video<00:05:07.250> there<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:08.380> what

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
there should be a a video there so what

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.440 
there should be a a video there so what
I<00:05:09.410> will<00:05:09.560> do<00:05:09.890> here<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:10.669> basically<00:05:10.880> write

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
I will do here is just basically write

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.950 
I will do here is just basically write
it<00:05:11.630> down<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.140> minus<00:05:12.860> 2<00:05:13.130> comes<00:05:13.490> down<00:05:13.789> here<00:05:14.300> this

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
it down so minus 2 comes down here this

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.590 
it down so minus 2 comes down here this
one<00:05:15.229> times<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:15.890> one<00:05:16.160> goes<00:05:16.430> over<00:05:16.460> here<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.120> have

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
one times this one goes over here I have

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.880 
one times this one goes over here I have
a<00:05:17.630> minus<00:05:17.870> 7<00:05:18.650> minus<00:05:19.220> 7<00:05:19.820> times<00:05:20.210> one<00:05:20.690> is<00:05:20.720> this<00:05:21.500> one

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
a minus 7 minus 7 times one is this one

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.170 
a minus 7 minus 7 times one is this one
is<00:05:22.240> let's<00:05:23.240> see<00:05:23.450> minus<00:05:24.350> 1<00:05:24.590> here<00:05:25.010> minus<00:05:25.550> 1<00:05:25.940> here

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
is let's see minus 1 here minus 1 here

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.050 
is let's see minus 1 here minus 1 here
plus<00:05:26.419> 3<00:05:27.200> as<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.890> can<00:05:28.070> see<00:05:28.310> I<00:05:28.340> actually<00:05:28.610> end<00:05:28.970> up

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
plus 3 as you can see I actually end up

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.500 
plus 3 as you can see I actually end up
exactly<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.720> same<00:05:30.080> it's<00:05:30.350> not<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.620> mystery<00:05:31.510> if

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
exactly the same it's not a mystery if

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.180 
exactly the same it's not a mystery if
we<00:05:32.780> have<00:05:32.930> time<00:05:33.229> we<00:05:33.440> might<00:05:33.470> actually<00:05:33.800> go

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
we have time we might actually go

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.029 
we have time we might actually go
through<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.460> but<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.240> point<00:05:35.450> is<00:05:35.720> look<00:05:36.020> if<00:05:36.260> f<00:05:36.740> of

happens when F of minus 4 minus 2 to 4
happened<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.490> minus<00:06:16.820> 1/2<00:06:17.090> well<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:18.080> computer

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
happened to minus 1/2 well the computer

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.620 
happened to minus 1/2 well the computer
calculated<00:06:19.220> it<00:06:19.340> as<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:19.580> can<00:06:19.729> see<00:06:20.030> here<00:06:20.300> you

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
calculated it as you can see here you

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.740 
calculated it as you can see here you
can<00:06:20.659> push<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.130> pause<00:06:22.130> it<00:06:22.340> if<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:22.640> have<00:06:23.390> trouble

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
can push a pause it if you have trouble

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.060 
can push a pause it if you have trouble
see<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:23.990> but<00:06:24.380> anyway<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.919> computer

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
see it but anyway the computer

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.129 
see it but anyway the computer
calculated<00:06:26.060> F<00:06:26.300> of<00:06:26.990> 1/2

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
calculated F of 1/2

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.619 
calculated F of 1/2
is<00:06:30.759> actually<00:06:31.759> equal<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:33.249> minus<00:06:34.249> happens<00:06:34.639> equal

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
is actually equal to minus happens equal

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.100 
is actually equal to minus happens equal
to<00:06:35.719> zero<00:06:35.990> okay<00:06:36.259> so<00:06:36.649> we<00:06:37.490> found<00:06:37.669> our<00:06:37.969> first<00:06:38.300> root

as<00:06:57.639> X<00:06:58.659> minus<00:06:59.659> this<00:06:59.929> root<00:07:00.519> okay<00:07:01.550> so<00:07:02.119> times

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:02.869 
as X minus this root okay so times

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.619 
as X minus this root okay so times
something<00:07:03.289> else<00:07:03.469> so<00:07:04.069> in<00:07:04.219> our<00:07:04.339> case<00:07:04.580> is<00:07:04.789> X<00:07:04.999> minus

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
something else so in our case is X minus

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.969 
something else so in our case is X minus
minus<00:07:06.050> 1/2<00:07:07.449> times<00:07:08.449> something<00:07:08.839> else<00:07:09.139> which<00:07:09.769> we

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
minus 1/2 times something else which we

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.679 
minus 1/2 times something else which we
can<00:07:10.159> use<00:07:10.339> synthetic<00:07:10.550> division<00:07:10.939> before<00:07:11.479> you

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689 
can use synthetic division before you

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
can use synthetic division before you
figure<00:07:11.990> out<00:07:12.019> in<00:07:12.259> part<00:07:12.559> 3<00:07:12.860> its<00:07:13.550> equal<00:07:14.089> to<00:07:14.209> x<00:07:14.509> plus

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:14.709 
figure out in part 3 its equal to x plus

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.259 
figure out in part 3 its equal to x plus
1/2

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:16.269 
1/2

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.299 
1/2
like<00:07:17.269> I<00:07:17.389> said<00:07:17.569> in<00:07:17.779> part<00:07:17.959> 3<00:07:18.319> we'll<00:07:18.800> go<00:07:19.009> through

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:19.309 
like I said in part 3 we'll go through

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:22.600 
like I said in part 3 we'll go through
this<00:07:19.459> one<00:07:19.729> more<00:07:20.169> carefully<00:07:21.169> but<00:07:21.439> for<00:07:21.709> now<00:07:21.889> this

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
this one more carefully but for now this

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.529 
this one more carefully but for now this
particular<00:07:23.389> problem<00:07:23.769> we<00:07:24.769> have<00:07:25.099> minus<00:07:25.879> 2x

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539 
particular problem we have minus 2x

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.129 
particular problem we have minus 2x
squared<00:07:27.039> minus<00:07:28.039> 4x<00:07:28.279> plus<00:07:28.610> 8<00:07:29.209> okay<00:07:29.779> so<00:07:29.839> I'll

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
squared minus 4x plus 8 okay so I'll

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.459 
squared minus 4x plus 8 okay so I'll
pick<00:07:30.319> up<00:07:30.379> where<00:07:30.740> we<00:07:31.309> left<00:07:31.459> off<00:07:31.930> over<00:07:32.930> here<00:07:33.259> you

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:33.469 
pick up where we left off over here you

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.819 
pick up where we left off over here you
part<00:07:33.800> 3<00:07:33.889> all<00:07:34.639> right
