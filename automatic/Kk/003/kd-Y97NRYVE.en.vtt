00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.089 
the lock bar is jumped so again you get
a<00:02:20.910> nice<00:02:21.120> grip<00:02:21.480> easy<00:02:22.379> open<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.220> close<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.670> there

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
a nice grip easy open and close on there

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.759 
a nice grip easy open and close on there
speaking<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> lock<00:02:26.459> bar<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.530> check

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
speaking of the lock bar you know check

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.880 
speaking of the lock bar you know check
that<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.180> I'm<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> stickler<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.049> early

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that out I'm not a stickler on early

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
that out I'm not a stickler on early
lockups<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.489> don't<00:02:32.670> necessarily<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.329> have

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
lockups I don't necessarily have to have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.400 
lockups I don't necessarily have to have
it<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.739> extremely<00:02:35.069> early<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
it you know extremely early but this is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.830 
it you know extremely early but this is
the<00:02:37.410> earliest<00:02:37.890> lock<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.060> any<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.390> my<00:02:39.510> knives

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the earliest lock up on any of my knives

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.130 
the earliest lock up on any of my knives
it's<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.890> earliest<00:02:41.129> ones<00:02:41.340> I've<00:02:41.489> seen

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's one of the earliest ones I've seen

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
it's one of the earliest ones I've seen
when<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> watch<00:02:43.470> other<00:02:43.709> people's<00:02:44.069> videos<00:02:44.750> which

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
when I watch other people's videos which

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.880 
when I watch other people's videos which
when<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:45.989> first<00:02:46.230> saw<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.650> oh<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
when I first saw it I was like oh I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.259 
when I first saw it I was like oh I
think<00:02:47.099> I've<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.549> break<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.879> in<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
think I've got to break that in there

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.800 
think I've got to break that in there
and<00:02:48.709> make<00:02:49.709> sure<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.950> get<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:51.150> know<00:02:51.239> slides<00:02:51.599> in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and make sure it get you know slides in

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.699 
and make sure it get you know slides in
just<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.799> I've<00:02:53.690> tried<00:02:54.709> to

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
just a little bit more but I've tried to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.990 
just a little bit more but I've tried to
make<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.430> slip<00:02:56.879> make<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.329> fail<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.640> won't

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
make it slip make it fail and it won't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.379 
make it slip make it fail and it won't
budge<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.530> absolutely<00:03:02.489> no<00:03:03.090> play

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
budge this is absolutely no play

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.449 
budge this is absolutely no play
vertically<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:04.139> horizontally<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.280> knife

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
vertically or horizontally on the knife

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.400 
vertically or horizontally on the knife
so<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:06.000> Jason<00:03:06.239> did<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.569> great<00:03:06.810> job<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
so I think Jason did a great job on the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.220 
so I think Jason did a great job on the
lock<00:03:07.590> geometry<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.810> course<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.109> know<00:03:10.200> all

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
lock geometry and of course you know all

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.170 
lock geometry and of course you know all
cutting<00:03:10.709> motion<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:11.280> putting<00:03:11.639> pressure<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
cutting motion I'm putting pressure the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.050 
cutting motion I'm putting pressure the
opposite<00:03:12.840> way<00:03:12.989> anyway<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.459> know<00:03:14.579> if<00:03:14.910> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
opposite way anyway and you know if I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.789 
opposite way anyway and you know if I
get<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.209> nice<00:03:15.389> grip<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.840> I'm<00:03:16.079> gay<00:03:16.530> gin<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
get a nice grip to it I'm gay gin the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.530 
get a nice grip to it I'm gay gin the
lock<00:03:16.950> bar<00:03:17.190> even<00:03:17.310> more<00:03:17.609> so<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.000> doesn't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
lock bar even more so that doesn't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.910 
lock bar even more so that doesn't
really<00:03:18.569> bother<00:03:18.840> me<00:03:19.049> but<00:03:19.260> when<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> saw<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.739> was

and / jason with his experience it's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.649 
and / jason with his experience it's
comparable<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.349> CPM<00:04:09.709> 154<00:04:10.370> he<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:11.299> told<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
comparable to CPM 154 he was told that

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.210 
comparable to CPM 154 he was told that
it<00:04:11.780> actually<00:04:11.930> has<00:04:12.290> better<00:04:12.620> edge<00:04:12.860> retention

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
it actually has better edge retention

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.870 
it actually has better edge retention
CPM<00:04:14.030> 154<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.890> if<00:04:16.039> you<00:04:16.130> guys<00:04:16.280> have<00:04:16.489> used<00:04:16.729> this

height<00:06:40.380> wise<00:06:40.650> that's<00:06:41.040> where<00:06:41.220> you'll<00:06:41.340> see<00:06:41.490> the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
height wise that's where you'll see the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
height wise that's where you'll see the
difference<00:06:41.639> where<00:06:42.180> this<00:06:42.780> feels<00:06:43.169> like<00:06:43.380> just<00:06:44.070> a

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
difference where this feels like just a

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.710 
difference where this feels like just a
beefier<00:06:45.650> harder<00:06:46.650> use<00:06:46.860> knife<00:06:49.700> heavier<00:06:50.700> and<00:06:51.270> so

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
beefier harder use knife heavier and so

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.200 
beefier harder use knife heavier and so
but<00:06:51.930> again<00:06:52.169> this<00:06:52.350> is<00:06:52.530> I<00:06:52.620> think<00:06:52.650> it<00:06:53.310> wasn't<00:06:54.060> me

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
but again this is I think it wasn't me

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.840 
but again this is I think it wasn't me
to<00:06:54.419> compete<00:06:55.350> with<00:06:55.650> this<00:06:55.889> but<00:06:56.400> i<00:06:56.430> just<00:06:56.639> want<00:06:56.820> to

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
to compete with this but i just want to

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.740 
to compete with this but i just want to
show<00:06:57.260> the<00:06:58.260> comparison<00:06:59.210> now<00:07:00.210> let's<00:07:00.389> go<00:07:00.539> to<00:07:00.570> a

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
show the comparison now let's go to a

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.990 
show the comparison now let's go to a
smaller<00:07:00.900> knife<00:07:01.580> the<00:07:02.720> crystal<00:07:03.720> small<00:07:04.699> my<00:07:05.699> card

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
smaller knife the crystal small my card

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.950 
smaller knife the crystal small my card
and<00:07:06.479> sing<00:07:06.720> go<00:07:06.840> with<00:07:07.229> micarta<00:07:07.800> end<00:07:07.919> lanes<00:07:08.100> and

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
and sing go with micarta end lanes and

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.300 
and sing go with micarta end lanes and
this<00:07:09.960> is<00:07:10.080> about<00:07:10.200> a<00:07:10.320> three-inch<00:07:10.889> blade<00:07:10.979> or

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
this is about a three-inch blade or

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.120 
this is about a three-inch blade or
right<00:07:11.550> under<00:07:11.789> 3<00:07:12.000> inches<00:07:12.050> so<00:07:13.050> again<00:07:13.770> you'll<00:07:13.950> get

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
right under 3 inches so again you'll get

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.110 
right under 3 inches so again you'll get
a<00:07:14.160> little<00:07:14.460> over<00:07:14.669> half<00:07:15.000> an<00:07:15.120> inch<00:07:15.270> on<00:07:15.479> the<00:07:16.100> Clark

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
a little over half an inch on the Clark

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.640 
a little over half an inch on the Clark
Warren<00:07:18.120> cliff<00:07:18.330> and<00:07:19.520> from<00:07:20.930> but<00:07:21.930> of<00:07:22.110> the<00:07:22.289> handles

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
Warren cliff and from but of the handles

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.129 
Warren cliff and from but of the handles
you'll<00:07:23.370> see<00:07:23.490> the<00:07:23.610> overall<00:07:23.940> like<00:07:24.150> there<00:07:27.139> and

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
you'll see the overall like there and

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.129 
you'll see the overall like there and
