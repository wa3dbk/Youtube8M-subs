00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 you have guests and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.310
 Episode 20 of FM Glorious Kind of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.960
 milestone 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 and you normally know I always upload 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 under day and where i have the last 4 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 days 4 videos uploaded and you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.370
 continue to provide that support so I think 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 you know if she keeps liking like that go there 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.859
 I just keep uploading I have 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.810
 vacation i ca n't afford it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.949
 I get you after a busier period with 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.660
 my study 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 so I'm going to enjoy it it can 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.289
 occupy the tactics for the moment 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 first game we have a play 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 bought that you just saw carlos tevez 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.869
 joint the team and carlos also at sea 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.759
 and many people look a little weird like 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 I do that but you don't notice him 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.590
 Also cm plays here comes the first 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 opportunity 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 while he is on the team and the second 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 chance makes it occasionally that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 indicates the stab paul tvs that excites 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 and how is it possible that one is central 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 midfielder is the furthest man I know 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.340
 not but he does it and that's why I think 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 this formation sir chill and people ask 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 me always through the chillste 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 formation to play and I think that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 you to so many episodes from der 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 venne lori that can guess that is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 namely just that 433 third variation 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.070
 have 2 CDs that stay behind 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.049
 your tcm that goes forward and there 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 also remains and therefore stuff 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.979
 actually sort of 424 and it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 Chilling out is that you are always four men 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.549
 may have to combine in distress 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 and you always have 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 six men in the back who prevent that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.430
 against your countess and we love it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 also really quite often the zero net 0 2 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 injured first game of the day 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.720
 get going 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 so that is nice if you are already right 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 wins second law scratches in again 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.250
 just set your own tactics how you 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.049
 wonder what i do 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.640
 watch a few episodes back 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.290
 episode 18 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 with the title what is your tactic in it 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 I explain what I always do 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.479
 and how to apply that to myself and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.220
 the score in the twelfth minute with you 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 video in jeff video is for me i think 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 the best left winger in the game 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.079
 I have not been allowed to try any of them 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.610
 I can buy it now I've had it 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.899
 purchased a playstation make companion 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 selling the really thought it was a stupid one 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.570
 action of the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 but on xbox I can also cook it and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 Don't scare people on Xbox is Ronaldo 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.079
 now a point 1 million iconic 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.909
 you know a point 1 million coins on xbox 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.799
 how few coins that is it is there for 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.850
 xbox it is a lot of coins because if you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.640
 can sell xbox 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.710
 are you now for one million are you 28 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.050
 Euros while you're on playstation 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.060
 I think 280 paid for Amy 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.410
 so those are sick amounts I think 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.760
 sorry I play ghost for me 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.290
 of course still just the shift 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.700
 but never ending or inward glory 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.870
 is also on xbox and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.640
 millions of hunts are gone 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.070
 playstation what for some time no code 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.210
 scored so weird who does that for us 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.500
 The funny thing was that I was during that 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.060
 also really thought oh shit i have 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.620
 actually always no longer scored and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.300
 I also notice that I scored less on how 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 the corner less effective what the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.750
 what the hell is going on 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.610
 but maybe he has something for you 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.320
 introduced that she thought a little red 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.580
 this is way too overpowerd being the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.770
 trailer that is for you 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.270
 and she is also scored against and 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.620
 if I hit a piece of stuff 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.180
 He scores a corner and do not say lazy 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.440
 on twitter bio I have you be 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.390
 scored or I played techno yesterday 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 thijs it jesus you that Leah and 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.660
 during that almost the same kind of person 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 like this it also holds a million and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.740
 roy sens-line sugar and he also scored 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.320
 a corner against me to my own way 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.930
 and yes that is sour if that happens 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.160
 well that can happen and this jar 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.960
 starts really bad 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.070
 old million basses I push on the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.960
 I should not have done a panic button 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.120
 because I float and to the side 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.920
 Anyway we give away a stupid penalty 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.890
 people who shoot arrows but no 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.140
 almost always measured something in this way 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.880
 in the middle but then to the right and we 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.430
 were playing some club sand yesterday 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.690
 goal stops on my livestream and milo 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.160
 and i told milo you gotta get into it 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.810
 continue to stand out amid the womb that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.530
 also this penalty so I should have done better 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.180
 know 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.820
 but why I show this entire clip 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.320
 is because your video is fixed from the counter 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.080
 his penalty who I had stopped 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.270
 so scored the moment the jar was there 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.010
 really starts to look like a drama 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.530
 better turn it around and out right away 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.060
 his chance to score and this opponent 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.070
 was sincere also good the least sincere 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.019
 good attack from a very good team 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.880
 metroid crowbar and check it in from 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.290
 albion is just deadly that is not possible 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.690
 so one two three stop you get the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.580
 it is called counters against so that's why 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 this formation so good so suzie vidal 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.090
 marco lans then in the back of the ball 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.950
 put back even gain the attack through 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.760
 is it sprint long enough that the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.650
 keeper 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.090
 his short angle really ex post as one 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.330
 silly because yes that's just a mistake 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.680
 in the game and then we are 0 3 in front of us 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.820
 getting this could still be done against seals 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.170
 with his right foot I didn't have it 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.400
 expected but went in that single 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.870
 opens itself a bit stupid 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.269
 but well that can happen may also be one 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.860
 make mistakes again it is west through 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.660
 weather is also by central 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.370
 midfielder who is the farthest man behind 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.120
 is in the field because this is how it works 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.620
 formation 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.510
 and I swear you give it a try 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.270
 He gets another chance with drones 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.410
 we do not know useful we stand 194 solut 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.970
 to win victories as well so 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.460
 but as we continue to put pressure 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.350
 dounia doesn't shoot the keeper for long 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.690
 long type of rebound spring roll was just right 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.010
 in a minute we want a five three times 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.270
 consecutively won 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.010
 we have the previous game of ankle 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.020
 I thought this was against 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.430
 game but only received against the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.110
 association looks pretty solid 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.280
 video afternoon the match proves itself 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.690
 once again that he is very important 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.190
 for the team 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.320
 at that moment I have 3 pots 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.850
 played and I thought you know this is long 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.350
 enough for an episode or would i 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.940
 just pop another jar at the back 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.139
 I did occupy the tactics well 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.090
 because he remained one of his who did not 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.520
 have to reset rated 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.330
 come against the premier league team 4411 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.699
 rooney at approx 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.139
 always a good choice that have costa 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.100
 always dangerous during rush hour 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.600
 we get the first chance of the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.889
 really compete from your video but do it 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.330
 when the difficulty hits the side net 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.560
 I did n't stay for it 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.300
 I still think it's one of youth 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.860
 left winger he is allowed there is a chance 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.050
 miss do yes be quite long here 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.580
 defender fuller cuckoo keeper 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.620
 comes out we quickly shoot one 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.150
 for reasonably easy and for the rest 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.560
 Something very much happened this 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.090
 match this is the only chance that that 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.349
 had the first half you can too 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.520
 See that just a shot at goal the bag 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.650
 then probably another tamar now 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.840
 maybe not but maybe it was 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.250
 not worth showing 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.599
 and he was pretty good at defending 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.889
 you can see how many people are behind 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.750
 which are there are currently five 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.130
 people in his penalty area I know 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.320
 not if you played that window on that 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.090
 our pressure was very high but just in 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.940
 at least he had a lot 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.889
 defenders and I had to go every time 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.330
 forcing my chances with my met 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.039
 le for players and make sure it doesn't 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.570
 sensitive if we have a counter at most 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.610
 people who play so defensively lurk 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.830
 close the counter with those wise words 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.570
 we finish this episode thanks people 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.860
 you deliver this heaven to the end 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.050
 have copied 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.310
