have been speaking and hearing about

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.879 
have been speaking and hearing about
digital<00:00:11.340> printing<00:00:11.880> since<00:00:12.349> many<00:00:13.349> years<00:00:13.469> ago<00:00:13.769> I

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
digital printing since many years ago I

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.400 
digital printing since many years ago I
think<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:14.809> trial<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> digital

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
think the first trial of a digital

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.080

production since a while like the
apparent<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.510> most<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> digital

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
apparent is that most of the digital

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.960 
apparent is that most of the digital
printing<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.470> design<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.590> born<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.040> digital<00:01:11.250> as

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
printing is design is born as digital as

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
printing is design is born as digital as
two<00:01:12.299> dies<00:01:12.479> digital<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.409> mean<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.369> real<00:01:14.549> goal<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
two dies digital I mean the real goal is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
two dies digital I mean the real goal is
to<00:01:15.210> produce<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> digital<00:01:16.350> printing<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to produce to the digital printing and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.750 
to produce to the digital printing and
not<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.759> same

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.280 

we<00:01:24.760> need<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.180> increase<00:01:25.450> our<00:01:25.600> level<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
we need to increase our level of

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.560 
we need to increase our level of
knowledge<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.670> technology<00:01:28.330> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
knowledge of the of the technology to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.070 
knowledge of the of the technology to
give<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:31.060> best<00:01:31.240> service<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.990> best

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
give the best service and the best

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.050 
give the best service and the best
quality<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.830> our<00:01:32.950> customer<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.700> don't<00:01:33.820> think

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
quality to our customer we don't think

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
quality to our customer we don't think
it's<00:01:34.240> just<00:01:35.100> pushing<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.220> button<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.760> producing

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
it's just pushing a button and producing

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.970 
it's just pushing a button and producing
we<00:01:37.600> think<00:01:37.840> there<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.080> lot<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.350> learn<00:01:38.680> in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
we think there is a lot to learn in

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.640 
we think there is a lot to learn in
terms<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:40.060> managing<00:01:40.390> whatever<00:01:41.170> comes<00:01:41.440> before

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
terms of managing whatever comes before

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.210 
terms of managing whatever comes before
digital<00:01:42.070> printing<00:01:42.820> managing<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.720> files

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
digital printing managing the files

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.410 
digital printing managing the files
preparing<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.400> thighs<00:01:45.640> managing<00:01:46.300> the

fabric<00:01:50.200> managing<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> finishing<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.610> mean

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
fabric managing the finishing I mean

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.300 
fabric managing the finishing I mean
it's<00:01:52.540> it's<00:01:52.930> different<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.680> we<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:54.130> to

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
it's it's different so we have to

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.680 
it's it's different so we have to
increase<00:01:54.520> our<00:01:54.670> level<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.120> knowledge<00:01:55.360> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
increase our level of knowledge and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.240 
increase our level of knowledge and
that's<00:01:55.930> why<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.260> decided<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.800> enter<00:01:56.980> this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that's why we decided to enter this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's why we decided to enter this
technology<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.000> invest<00:01:58.300> I<00:02:04.080> preferred<00:02:05.080> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
technology in to invest I preferred to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.460 
technology in to invest I preferred to
approach<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.670> company<00:02:07.120> which<00:02:07.390> was<00:02:07.750> full

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
approach a company which was full

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.640 
approach a company which was full

compared<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.800> someone<00:02:12.040> else<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:12.580> may<00:02:12.610> be

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
compared to someone else which may be

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.810 
compared to someone else which may be
very<00:02:13.330> good<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.660> terms<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.520> working<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.730> a

there'll<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.950> an<00:02:24.250> application<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.420> the

there'll be a an application in the

there'll be a an application in the
inject<00:02:26.040> technology<00:02:27.040> that's<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> reason<00:02:27.520> why

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
inject technology that's the reason why

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.690 
inject technology that's the reason why
with<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.690> decide<00:02:29.200> I've<00:02:30.040> been<00:02:30.280> choosing

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
with this I decide I've been choosing

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:40.370 
with this I decide I've been choosing
into<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> stress<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.900> partnering<00:02:32.350> is

in<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.590> opinion<00:02:41.890> dust<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.430> completely

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
in my opinion dust is completely

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.870 
in my opinion dust is completely
different<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.410> normal<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.830> dust<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.400> really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
different the normal of dust is really

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.690 
different the normal of dust is really
