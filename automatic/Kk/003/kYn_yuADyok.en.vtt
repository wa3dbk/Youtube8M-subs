for<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.050> example<00:01:16.260> we<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:17.130> only<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.520> marking

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
for this example we will only be marking

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:29.930 
for this example we will only be marking
off<00:01:18.030> two<00:01:18.330> placements<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.580> I've<00:01:29.670> mapped

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
off two placements now that I've mapped

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.969 
off two placements now that I've mapped
out<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> placement<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.229> designs<00:01:31.650> I'm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
out the placement for my designs I'm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
out the placement for my designs I'm
going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.160> get<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> tattoo<00:01:32.880> ready<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.330> paint

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
going to get the tattoo ready to paint

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
going to get the tattoo ready to paint
now<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> pattern<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
now you can see that the pattern is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
now you can see that the pattern is
quite<00:01:35.790> intricate<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> can't<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.020> tape

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
quite intricate so I can't just tape

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
quite intricate so I can't just tape
around<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> outside<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.670> paint<00:01:39.330> over<00:01:39.690> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
around the outside and paint over that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
around the outside and paint over that
the<00:01:40.080> paint<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.800> bleed<00:01:41.130> under<00:01:41.550> all

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the paint would actually bleed under all

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
the paint would actually bleed under all
of<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.940> areas<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.960> instead<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of these areas so instead I'm going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
of these areas so instead I'm going to
use<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> low-tax<00:01:44.490> spray<00:01:44.880> adhesive<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
use a low-tax spray adhesive and just

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.400 
use a low-tax spray adhesive and just
lightly<00:01:46.110> coat<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> entire<00:01:46.740> surface<00:01:48.410> spray

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
lightly coat the entire surface spray

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.560 
lightly coat the entire surface spray
evenly<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.190> distance<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.670> approximately<00:01:50.789> 10

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
evenly at a distance of approximately 10

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
evenly at a distance of approximately 10
to<00:01:51.600> 12<00:01:51.899> inches<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.410> surface<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.190> then

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to 12 inches from the surface and then

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.389 
to 12 inches from the surface and then
let<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.119> sit<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.690> minute<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.830> sure<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.160> spray

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
let it sit for a minute be sure to spray

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
let it sit for a minute be sure to spray
only<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.820> small<00:01:57.180> amount<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.810> avoid<00:01:58.140> leaving<00:01:58.440> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
only a small amount to avoid leaving a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.580 
only a small amount to avoid leaving a
sticky<00:01:59.009> residue<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.729> wall<00:02:00.050> now<00:02:01.050> place
