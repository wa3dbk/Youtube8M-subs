00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.960
 well my new episode of this new cd v speaks of benedict 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.860
 volumes of news there is also an explosive, it remains 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.270
 is that households with this that is mainly that has modern PS 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.460
 snow there and then you say when this decision have been made with his 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.920
 all because yes, after all, they also wanted to match the interviews 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.390
 nevertheless it will be faster to present and so you can go too long 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.660
 we also expect a lot of new things 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.139
 like off 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.419
 I'm going to do a little and a radius of a few hectares and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.540
 not quite a salt set but with the cutting and stuff or psn plus one 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.230
 third 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.300
 so you can say that 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.970
 expected price dr and the market 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 this allows it to see on the e40 and videos I want more than a band that is 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.660
 never left 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.740
 the market master there 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 at lycurgus already expect a tuesday thanks to a very 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.670
 present a sports store and that is all about rain and wind that ever 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 five minutes of ownership, I'm going to prepare your food with a little treble 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700
 you don't have to wear them 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 it sounds 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.210
 that did not start 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 Company 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.670
 4 internet users in their neighborhood 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.910
 But that is not where it is part of a mortgage 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 it also says that it will be online around half past four on Tuesday 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.130
 so i would say that it also says the news that announced the response 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.240
 namely driving 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.180
 9-year-old midfielder because I'm going to keep it a secret for a while 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.880
 while drink girl 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.920
 can finally end 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.060
 this is not expected then it would be very safe compared to the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.759
 last week it was already discussed whether the last training day a new recipe 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.510
 well again a Kurdish would like to commit on a plane that en route 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.889
 just touched 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.889
 but of course you should do well there as I would say 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.999
 keep looking at details if there is no benefit say look what is there 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.310
 is a new one in the industry 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.719
 and then know via email 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.949
 not be completed by the end of May either. so period go for the same facts 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.959
 Kurdish 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.749
 that's news though that's what she's 60 points system for her 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.999
 keep following 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.259
 This had a number of countries on Windows 8 day offering nice opportunity to content 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.749
 to buy the money does not flick more points but both bodies husband 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.709
 is seven more waiting 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.209
 and three times as much for the people who were waiting a while ago 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.170
 flat to help who was nevertheless canceled who is coming the eu may 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.870
 to start 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.540
 That is what especially applies to the 100 backs 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.730
 in recent years smoking is going to be Zeeland 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.420
 after the movie they could soon get started on stalingrad being the first 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.460
 quarter different 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.600
 Certainly for the fans his Jaap is us but well now you actually have me 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.690
 am very curious yes day of construction football game now as much our country I 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.459
 also looks forward to 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.419
 the sign baker movie country we are just that we are very happy to have that with the 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.550
 trailers of the views and wishes 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.330
 certainly because the winter yes how that would be in the film according to 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.690
 Reportedly, the trainers' tickets have a follow-up to the car 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.789
 Michelle Selection dropped Sweden to meet popular half live moss 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.730
 and in it they also go to work with the help of a couple and such 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.120
 for pronouncing it was good but if the pronunciation is 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.450
 on Sunday evening 31 October you can expect this so the figures also others 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.330
 The reason for this is the titles as it is mainly about being the fourth one 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.310
 campaign of victory in a row automatically free play between the two 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.890
 is not the first to do before you became the champion 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.730
 With the sale added to it there have been announced that new super mario 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.400
 brittle for the wii calling 1080p sps 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.849
 remarkable is that you just want to protect inside 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:16.179
 I thought they were 27 p so Marcus made that 1080 p is d 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.709
 the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.669
 but were left behind in the news after he had a lot of fighting spirit 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.499
 and that they took 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.069
 goody got some on a further kurdish playing time 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.340
 an article about anything and everything about their website 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.249
 also have the weapon news item to deal with 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.120
 anyway 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.999
 it's about that 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.860
 Heijmans has announced a tent for the first time that we have announced 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.980
 here we already see 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.159
 the mole 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.159
 and you are and a leg 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.289
 BP of that time lived one of these also sees such things as that 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.029
 you can trophy complaints for years 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.580
 the set strongly back 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.960
 passes to live 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.199
 and of course one can not spend that money via e-mail, we assume 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.550
 kingston 8 gigabyte the day before the camera and dsb stand thorn 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.360
 the Swedish knows 0 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.820
 and of course and that is really very important or you very important 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.569
 also for some time especially the people who are up to 6 if you have 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.710
 a continuation jet but it is a 6 year 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.639
 and one point of this becomes the strongest on the shirt 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.189
 and he helped build 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.519
 4 and of course you have a kingston jet 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.980
 plus that you are coming again 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.699
 it is the third time to get used to it 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.870
 then they only think they seem to operate 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.789
 and it is now twenty food on our twitter the description that are 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.430

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.889
 for natural weather herent 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.849
 Moreover, you do not have to put up with it and thus also immediately leave the cabinet 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.409
 is paid we make the odds 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.590
 this sets the prices for tickets 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.999
 j 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.800
 also here in this video there is a large factories building one anyway 

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:19.440

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.580
 demkes 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.129

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.779
 not to do this 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.740
 there is no point 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.249
