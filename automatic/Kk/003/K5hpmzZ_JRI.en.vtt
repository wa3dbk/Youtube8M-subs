00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.030

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.509
 today I will tell you what 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.620
 made purchases lately in 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 Thin just for spring why 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.220
 me like this shortage of sweaters because 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 not always dislike most 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 beautiful sweaters why ice is under the throat with 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
 such terrible big drives it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 terribly uncomfortable she suffocates me then 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.399
 I prefer to put a scarf on top 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 but damn sweater with throat is pain and fear 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 and misery usually setra which will 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 like this, they are also the bottom 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 short water they sort of 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.250
 fashion of the year and but would eat to be warm 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 greeted here and it turns out took this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.559
 the sweater is perfect and the country of the firm 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 the firm is yours 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.300
 the first time I see such a company in general 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.430
 the whole store in general spiral Igor 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 My next purchase is such here 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.470
 jeans from jan piero they are very cool 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.689
 I always wanted blue 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.000
 jeans we somehow took purple something else 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.740
 here some tsepny was not yet and took 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.630
 their jan career camp there was at 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 First Sale Second John Kerry 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 legroom long enough for me 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.950
 many other stores what size is it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 and generally designed for people very 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 I think short because I 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 where do not go jeans for me it's just 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 training because there is no all at once 3 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.820
 a quarter and it seems to be not really it'sa 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.020
 me forging 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.060
 next thing i bought myself 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.159
 this is such an advertiser already 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.770
 seen in one of my videos about him very 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.290
 cool nice quality and gorgeous 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.729
 color I just trudge from him and last 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 the thing that I decided to add my 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.590
 wardrobe this here is such a came for 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480
 racer he does not sleep on so soft I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 always so on 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.610
 people such things such as colors 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.260
 just like that you can touch it 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.060
 pet shops are so cool and 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.350
 there was only such a color but it was bright 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.300
 leopard then you know such a red-haired child 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.540
 color and this is what such ashen 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.330
 shade and I decided that well, it was not 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.190
 let's try and help it looks 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.300
 very cool really though here so here 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.300
 so it doesn't look like that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.239
 quite 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.370
 and pass on to my cosmetic shopping 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.090
 and immediately warn you that if you review 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.820
 clothes i 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 new then reviews cosmetics i'm not at all 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.360
 I can, that is, I probably even girlfriends 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.550
 again something good advise because 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.220
 what to collect even two or three words of cosmetics 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.750
 for me, upward difficulty telling 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.290
 what's out here is i have a corrector 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.330
 from letuual 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.160
 Director from the clinics in the morning I cast earlier 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.930
 and not very well disposed to the firm 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.490
 it seemed to me she was not very flying 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.550
 good last year I had a chance 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.650
 try and not like so here 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.990
 Wait, I also decided to take a chance and platoon 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.120
 powder although previously I enjoyed five years 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.650
 exclusively bourgeois and decided to take two 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.290
 corrector because they have different 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.360
 texture and decided that clinics would be better 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.290
 under the eyes and this one is better to gloss over 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.420
 some 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.310
 on the face of the bumps so here i hope 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.870
 accessible and understandable told no cop 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.070
 I got this video and I 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.110
 I hope she will give you a little bit 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.900
 I liked it and it was even a little bit 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.580
 useful so don't forget to bet 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.530
 fingers up and of course 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.530
 subscribe to the channel I love everyone bye
