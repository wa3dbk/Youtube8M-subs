some kind of tape to tape it down on all
four<00:02:13.920> sides<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.640> use<00:02:15.390> craft<00:02:15.810> tape<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.950> wet

tough<00:02:22.770> masking<00:02:23.400> tape<00:02:23.610> might<00:02:24.000> work<00:02:24.330> but

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
tough masking tape might work but

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.030 
tough masking tape might work but
sometimes<00:02:25.110> they're<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:25.350> strong<00:02:25.709> enough<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
sometimes they're not strong enough to
