demonstration for you on it it's

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.430 
demonstration for you on it it's
producing<00:00:09.269> pretty<00:00:09.480> good<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> didn't<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.259> if

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
producing pretty good I didn't know if

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.839 
producing pretty good I didn't know if
it<00:00:10.530> was<00:00:10.650> gonna<00:00:10.830> produce<00:00:11.009> as<00:00:11.309> good<00:00:11.549> as<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
it was gonna produce as good as I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.770 
it was gonna produce as good as I
thought<00:00:12.089> but<00:00:13.400> anyways<00:00:14.419> let<00:00:15.419> me<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.660> this

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
thought but anyways let me get this

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.100 
thought but anyways let me get this
going

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
going

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.920 
going
temperatures<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.650> 120<00:00:17.689> let<00:00:18.689> me<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.869> ahead

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
temperatures about 120 let me go ahead

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170 
temperatures about 120 let me go ahead
and<00:00:19.019> get<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.320> test<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.890> real<00:00:20.130> quick<00:00:20.400> I'm

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and get this test going real quick I'm

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
and get this test going real quick I'm
just<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.689> ahead<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.279> plug<00:00:23.279> this

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
just going to go ahead and plug this

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:48.240 
just going to go ahead and plug this
thing<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.449> second

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.849 

I'm<00:00:48.730> gonna<00:00:48.850> try<00:00:49.090> this<00:00:49.149> again<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:51.309> is

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
I'm gonna try this again do is

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:01.620 
I'm gonna try this again do is
and<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.519> here<00:00:53.999> that<00:00:54.390> whoops

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.270 

I<00:01:01.720> don't<00:01:02.230> know<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:02.470> can<00:01:02.620> read<00:01:02.770> that<00:01:02.800> or<00:01:03.130> not

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
I don't know if you can read that or not

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:15.660 
I don't know if you can read that or not
trying<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.850> get<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.360> work

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.500 

nineteen<00:01:16.540> point<00:01:16.750> seven<00:01:17.229> seven<00:01:17.440> seconds

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
nineteen point seven seven seconds

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.600 
nineteen point seven seven seconds
that's<00:01:19.510> a<00:01:19.810> half<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.500> liter<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.130> can<00:01:21.400> figure

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
that's a half a liter so you can figure

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's a half a liter so you can figure
that<00:01:21.700> out<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.659> we're<00:01:23.260> at<00:01:23.320> 13<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:24.220> mean<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.180> sorry

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
that out and we're at 13 I mean it sorry

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.770 
that out and we're at 13 I mean it sorry
12<00:01:25.659> point<00:01:25.990> 13<00:01:26.770> volts<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:29.369> 18<00:01:30.369> amps<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
12 point 13 volts at 18 amps this is the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.590 
12 point 13 volts at 18 amps this is the
cell<00:01:32.020> again

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.100 

trying<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> show<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> quick<00:01:37.740> view<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.190> it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
trying to show you a quick view of it

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.060 
trying to show you a quick view of it
took<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.260> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> figured

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
took me a little bit to get it figured

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.350 
took me a little bit to get it figured
out<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.670> finally<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.659> work

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
out but finally got it to work

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.720 
out but finally got it to work
you<00:01:45.110> can<00:01:45.230> see<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.590> put<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.980> negatives<00:01:46.580> on

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
you can see that I put the negatives on

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.260 
you can see that I put the negatives on
one<00:01:47.000> side<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:49.280> pauses<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.850> on<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.120> other

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
one side and the pauses is on the other

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.850 
one side and the pauses is on the other
side<00:01:50.570> supposedly<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.260> supposed<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.560> help<00:01:51.770> a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
side supposedly I supposed to help a

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.930 
side supposedly I supposed to help a
little<00:01:51.950> bit<00:01:52.130> more<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.400> efficiency<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:54.850> like<00:01:55.850> I

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
little bit more on efficiency but like I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.180 
little bit more on efficiency but like I
said<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.240> cell<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.540> about<00:01:56.750> 120<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:57.740> it's<00:01:57.890> I

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
said the cell is about 120 so it's I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.600 
said the cell is about 120 so it's I
mean<00:01:58.610> that's<00:01:58.790> pretty<00:01:59.030> warm

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
mean that's pretty warm

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.740 
mean that's pretty warm
so<00:02:01.710> hopefully<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:03.010> gives<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.250> guys<00:02:03.460> some

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so hopefully that gives you guys some

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.520 
so hopefully that gives you guys some
information<00:02:04.750> that's<00:02:05.710> all<00:02:05.890> for<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.100> but
