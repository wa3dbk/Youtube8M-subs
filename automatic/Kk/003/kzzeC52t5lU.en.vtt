pressed<00:05:12.310> down<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.759> side<00:05:13.060> nicely<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.889> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
pressed down this side nicely on the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.529 
pressed down this side nicely on the
base<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.539> line<00:05:16.949> along<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.340> way<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.449> I've

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
base of the line along the way and I've

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.020 
base of the line along the way and I've
put<00:05:19.900> on<00:05:19.990> some<00:05:20.229> steam<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.979> some<00:05:21.460> water<00:05:21.699> and<00:05:21.940> I

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
put on some steam and some water and I

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.619 
put on some steam and some water and I
made<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.020> very<00:05:23.110> nice<00:05:23.789> crease<00:05:24.789> and<00:05:25.210> then<00:05:25.300> I

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
made that a very nice crease and then I

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:32.189 
made that a very nice crease and then I
put<00:05:26.080> in<00:05:26.199> some<00:05:26.440> pins<00:05:29.310> just<00:05:30.310> on<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.610> edge<00:05:31.199> to

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
put in some pins just on the edge to

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.499 
put in some pins just on the edge to
make<00:05:32.409> sure<00:05:32.740> that<00:05:33.039> this<00:05:33.219> stays<00:05:33.580> in<00:05:33.639> place<00:05:34.090> and

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
make sure that this stays in place and

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.709 
make sure that this stays in place and
then<00:05:35.469> I<00:05:35.620> sort<00:05:35.830> of<00:05:35.919> worked<00:05:36.669> my<00:05:36.909> way<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.539> the

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
then I sort of worked my way up to the

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.180 
then I sort of worked my way up to the
other<00:05:37.960> side<00:05:38.849> flattening<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:40.029> fabric<00:05:41.069> and<00:05:42.069> I

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
other side flattening the fabric and I

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.850 
other side flattening the fabric and I
want<00:05:42.340> my<00:05:42.460> iron<00:05:42.699> sort<00:05:43.389> of<00:05:43.449> make<00:05:44.020> sure<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.500> you

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
want my iron sort of make sure that you

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.640 
want my iron sort of make sure that you
know<00:05:44.979> keep<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.580> side<00:05:45.849> down<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:47.020> then<00:05:47.139> work

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
know keep that side down and then work

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.459 
know keep that side down and then work
your<00:05:47.680> way<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.039> this<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.669> you'll<00:05:48.789> find<00:05:49.469> natural

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
your way to this and you'll find natural

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.279 
your way to this and you'll find natural
crease<00:05:51.130> on<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:51.520> side<00:05:51.789> too<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:53.050> then<00:05:53.139> once

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
crease on this side too and then once

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.659 
crease on this side too and then once
you<00:05:53.440> find<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:53.860> you<00:05:54.219> also<00:05:55.710> neatly<00:05:56.710> press<00:05:57.490> that

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
you find that you also neatly press that

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.779 
you find that you also neatly press that
in<00:05:57.789> place<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.330> some<00:05:58.360> steam<00:05:58.900> some<00:05:59.440> water<00:05:59.789> and

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
in place with some steam some water and

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.070 
in place with some steam some water and
then<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.060> end<00:06:01.180> result<00:06:01.569> is<00:06:01.719> that<00:06:01.779> you<00:06:02.050> will

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
then the end result is that you will

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.820 
then the end result is that you will
have<00:06:02.199> a<00:06:02.409> nicely<00:06:02.819> flat<00:06:03.819> lag<00:06:04.169> with<00:06:05.169> two<00:06:05.380> sharp

have a nicely flat lag with two sharp

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.649 
have a nicely flat lag with two sharp
creases<00:06:06.219> and<00:06:07.029> you<00:06:07.779> go<00:06:07.960> as<00:06:08.139> high<00:06:08.319> as<00:06:08.349> you<00:06:08.590> can

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
creases and you go as high as you can

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.330
