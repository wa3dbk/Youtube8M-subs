i was something getting a four o'clock
five<00:00:33.090> o'clock<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.660> i<00:00:33.750> started<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.290> much

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
five o'clock and i started to get much

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
five o'clock and i started to get much
longer<00:00:35.070> battery<00:00:35.340> life<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> device

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
longer battery life out of the device

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
longer battery life out of the device
and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.260> kept<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:37.620> usage<00:00:37.950> contacts<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> really

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and I kept my usage contacts I really

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
and I kept my usage contacts I really
was<00:00:38.940> monitoring<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.719> closely<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> want

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
was monitoring it very closely so I want

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.110 
was monitoring it very closely so I want
to<00:00:40.950> share<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> tips<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to share with you some of the tips that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
to share with you some of the tips that
I<00:00:42.270> loaded<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> 3g<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.710> carried

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I loaded with the 3g that have carried

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.970 
I loaded with the 3g that have carried
over<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.850> 3gs<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.620> helped<00:00:46.890> me

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
over to the 3gs that have helped me

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.180 
over to the 3gs that have helped me
maximize<00:00:47.550> battery<00:00:47.789> life<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.780> 3gs<00:00:49.289> does<00:00:49.770> claim

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
maximize battery life the 3gs does claim

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
maximize battery life the 3gs does claim
much<00:00:50.820> better<00:00:51.090> battery<00:00:51.420> left<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> 3g<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
much better battery left in the 3g and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.240 
much better battery left in the 3g and
i'll<00:00:53.550> show<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.420> maximize<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
i'll show you how to maximize that to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
i'll show you how to maximize that to
its<00:00:56.520> fullest<00:00:57.210> potential<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> first<00:00:58.980> thing

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
its fullest potential so the first thing

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
its fullest potential so the first thing
that<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.250> recommend<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.969> calibrating<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that i recommend is calibrating the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229 
that i recommend is calibrating the
battery<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.070> calibrating<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> battery<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
battery so calibrating the battery is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.460 
battery so calibrating the battery is
you<00:01:03.359> might<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.629> familiar<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> term

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you might be familiar with that term

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.510 
you might be familiar with that term
from<00:01:05.210> your<00:01:06.210> laptop<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> use<00:01:08.400> your

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
from your laptop so when you use your

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
from your laptop so when you use your
device<00:01:08.670> essentially<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> memory

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
device essentially you have a memory

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
device essentially you have a memory
meter<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> upper<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.490> hand<00:01:11.640> corner

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
meter in the upper right hand corner

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969 
meter in the upper right hand corner
either<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> displaying<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> number<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
either you displaying the number or a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
either you displaying the number or a
visual<00:01:14.790> representation<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:16.020> visual

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
visual representation that visual

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
visual representation that visual
representation<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.520> always<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.880> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
representation might not always be so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
representation might not always be so
accurate<00:01:18.479> essentially<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> phone<00:01:19.590> need

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
accurate essentially what the phone need

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
accurate essentially what the phone need
is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> reference<00:01:20.939> point<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.479> what

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
is a reference point and what

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
is a reference point and what
calibrating<00:01:22.560> does<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> gives<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> an<00:01:23.400> accurate

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
calibrating does it gives it an accurate

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
calibrating does it gives it an accurate
reference<00:01:24.000> point<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> updates<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
reference point it updates it so the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.260 
reference point it updates it so the
reference<00:01:26.100> point<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
reference point that was in there with a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.420 
reference point that was in there with a
photo<00:01:27.479> shift<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:28.049> accurate<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> few<00:01:29.189> days

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
photo shift was accurate but a few days

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.399 
photo shift was accurate but a few days
or<00:01:29.729> weeks<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.090> even<00:01:30.150> months<00:01:30.329> later<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
or weeks or even months later the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
or weeks or even months later the
reference<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.040> may<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.340> shifted<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.000> well

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
reference point may have shifted so well

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.370 
reference point may have shifted so well
in<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.360> phone<00:01:33.600> says<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.110> twenty

that you can do to see the biggest

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.420 
that you can do to see the biggest
increase<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.200> your<00:03:17.260> battery<00:03:17.560> life<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.920> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
increase in your battery life is to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.300 
increase in your battery life is to
change<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> brightness<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.540> go<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> settings

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
change the brightness so go to settings

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.520 
change the brightness so go to settings
go<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.340> brightness<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.080> pull<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.170> all<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.380> way

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
go to brightness and pull it all the way

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.840 
go to brightness and pull it all the way
down<00:03:23.620> or<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.160> least<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.459> level<00:03:24.730> we're

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
down or at least a level we're

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.880 
down or at least a level we're
comfortable<00:03:25.360> at<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.750> will<00:03:26.380> say<00:03:26.650> though<00:03:26.860> that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
comfortable at I will say though that

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.890 
comfortable at I will say though that
while<00:03:27.190> I'm<00:03:27.310> saying<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.760> do<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.299> generally

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
while I'm saying to do this I generally

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.630 
while I'm saying to do this I generally
keep<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> brightness<00:03:29.590> up<00:03:29.769> relatively<00:03:30.280> high

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
keep the brightness up relatively high

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.699 
keep the brightness up relatively high
on<00:03:30.910> my<00:03:31.060> phone<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.630> turned<00:03:32.080> down<00:03:32.290> right<00:03:32.560> now

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
on my phone it's turned down right now

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.650 
on my phone it's turned down right now
because<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.190> bright<00:03:33.430> doesn't<00:03:33.970> always<00:03:34.299> show

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
because the bright doesn't always show

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.960 
because the bright doesn't always show
up<00:03:34.690> best<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.890> camera<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:36.459> turning

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
up best on the camera but turning

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.789 
up best on the camera but turning
brightness<00:03:37.510> down<00:03:37.690> will<00:03:37.989> definitely<00:03:38.560> help

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
brightness down will definitely help

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.430 
brightness down will definitely help
with<00:03:38.920> battery<00:03:39.549> also<00:03:39.850> auto<00:03:40.600> brightness<00:03:40.930> turn

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
with battery also auto brightness turn

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.650 
with battery also auto brightness turn
that<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.400> will<00:03:42.760> automatically<00:03:43.570> adjust

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
that on that will automatically adjust

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.930 
that on that will automatically adjust
the<00:03:44.019> phone's<00:03:44.290> keep<00:03:45.100> saying<00:03:45.340> right<00:03:45.519> it's<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.790> lot

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
the phone's keep saying right it's a lot

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.150 
the phone's keep saying right it's a lot
but<00:03:46.540> it'll<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.260> brightness<00:03:47.680> level<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
but it'll just the brightness level to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.190 
but it'll just the brightness level to
optimize<00:03:48.700> your<00:03:48.730> battery<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.630> for<00:03:49.959> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
with push notifications if you turn

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.130 
with push notifications if you turn
those<00:03:57.519> off<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.820> will<00:03:58.329> also<00:03:58.480> get<00:03:58.750> increased

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
those off you will also get increased

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.270 
those off you will also get increased
battery<00:03:59.290> life<00:03:59.590> especially<00:03:59.769> if<00:04:00.100> you're<00:04:00.250> using

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
advantage of push that does take some

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.810 
advantage of push that does take some
battery<00:04:05.290> life<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:05.739> drastic<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:06.549> it's<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
battery life it's not drastic but it's a

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.030 
battery life it's not drastic but it's a
little<00:04:07.269> bit<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:07.600> an<00:04:07.690> increase<00:04:08.049> that<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.860> can

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
little bit of an increase that you can

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
little bit of an increase that you can
get<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.940> next<00:04:10.150> thing<00:04:10.299> is<00:04:10.329> Wi-Fi<00:04:10.840> asked<00:04:12.060> to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
get the next thing is Wi-Fi asked to

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.060 
get the next thing is Wi-Fi asked to
join<00:04:13.269> network<00:04:13.600> turn<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.380> off<00:04:14.440> if<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.799> doesn't

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
join network turn that off if it doesn't

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.370 
join network turn that off if it doesn't
turn<00:04:15.310> off<00:04:15.640> your<00:04:15.880> Wi-Fi<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:16.989> turns<00:04:17.200> off<00:04:17.320> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
turn off your Wi-Fi it just turns off a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.050 
turn off your Wi-Fi it just turns off a
little<00:04:17.590> notification<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:18.280> pops<00:04:18.520> up<00:04:18.729> let<00:04:18.940> you

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
little notification that pops up let you

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.140

know<00:04:19.180> there<00:04:19.390> are<00:04:19.419> Wi-Fi<00:04:20.220> hotspots<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:21.849> most<00:04:22.030> of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
know there are Wi-Fi hotspots so most of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.710 
know there are Wi-Fi hotspots so most of
time<00:04:22.330> we're

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
time we're

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.840 
time we're
in<00:04:22.810> Wi-Fi<00:04:23.230> you<00:04:23.290> generally<00:04:23.710> know<00:04:23.950> where<00:04:24.670> those

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
in Wi-Fi you generally know where those

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.550 
in Wi-Fi you generally know where those
hot<00:04:25.090> spots<00:04:25.270> are<00:04:25.600> in<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.050> place<00:04:26.170> where<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.470> don't

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
hot spots are in a place where you don't

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.470 
hot spots are in a place where you don't
you<00:04:27.160> can<00:04:27.280> always<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.670> check<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.270> did

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
you can always just check like I did

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.720 
you can always just check like I did
right<00:04:28.660> now<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.050> go<00:04:29.200> into<00:04:29.320> Wi-Fi<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.100> seal<00:04:30.670> a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
right now and go into Wi-Fi and seal a

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.340 
right now and go into Wi-Fi and seal a
different<00:04:31.060> network<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.750> still<00:04:31.960> connect

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
different network you can still connect

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.950 
different network you can still connect
it<00:04:32.530> just<00:04:32.710> turns<00:04:32.950> off<00:04:33.160> notifications<00:04:34.150> really

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
it just turns off notifications really

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.320 
it just turns off notifications really
just<00:04:35.230> some<00:04:35.410> simple<00:04:35.650> steps<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.760> next<00:04:37.030> thing<00:04:37.150> if

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
just some simple steps the next thing if

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.120 
just some simple steps the next thing if
you're<00:04:37.450> like<00:04:37.660> me<00:04:37.900> use<00:04:38.110> speakerphone<00:04:38.560> quite<00:04:39.100> a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
you're like me use speakerphone quite a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.870 
you're like me use speakerphone quite a
bit<00:04:39.430> when<00:04:40.060> using<00:04:40.390> speakerphone<00:04:41.580> hit<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.700> top

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
bit when using speakerphone hit the top

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.360 
bit when using speakerphone hit the top
button<00:04:43.020> that'll<00:04:44.020> turn<00:04:44.320> off<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.920> screen<00:04:44.980> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
button that'll turn off the screen you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.190 
button that'll turn off the screen you
can<00:04:45.460> still<00:04:45.640> use<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.910> speaker<00:04:46.240> just<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.840> you

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
can still use the speaker just as you

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.350 
can still use the speaker just as you
would<00:04:47.380> be<00:04:47.530> for<00:04:47.860> definitely<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:48.760> think<00:04:48.820> helps

would be for definitely I think helps

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.850 
would be for definitely I think helps
