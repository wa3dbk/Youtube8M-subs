00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.390
 So the song has been part of me since 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.110
 little child comes flying father was 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 This family is expected of me and in the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 is to stay 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.469
 this is what I know the song through 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.670
 of my parents in the church, the people playing 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.890
 an instrument 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.999
 It was even in the church that I met 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.670
 dino and from there we have this friendship 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:07.090
 and music strengthens increasingly 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.500
 friendship everything where I have true had 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.870
 what now will have to cut people 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.150
 find a person who strengthens each 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.340
 and is increasingly strengthening 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.810
 so our work was the check 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 here since 2006 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.400
 he saw our only liked us too 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 I like his job and we 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.710
 He started this partnership and hopefully 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.440
 come more work so a new 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.630
 friendship with him he said that 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.760
 had a project with jack a friend of his 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.840
 which even records behind this 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.550
 and wanted to catch the artists from here. 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.520
 of diadem the people who came in 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.190
 studio to do this program 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.100
 At the time I was a little silly without 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.840
 want because we just wanted to record 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.620
 A song to have for us, never 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.020
 he thought of making no recordings without 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:04.570
 punctuate matter only half as a hobby 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.660
 naldo is enjoying the deputy then 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.970
 It therefore is when will 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.150
 bend this refrain I can change the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.340
 line of location and 2 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.970
 so it can make a difference 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.599
 project we make solo music with these 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.670
 our characteristics of a single voice was 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.909
 an idea of ​​our own agent 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.980
 personally I will feast with 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.920
 different 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.870
 let's make it as simple as possible 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.390
 we used to always get a song and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.329
 make a version that I could leave a

 little to show our face is there to 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.549
 the cheek program preferred that the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.129
 people to make a more authorial and 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.049
 Then he said to us, suggested to 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.549
 people wrote a song and made a 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:03:03.909
 stop over our idea of ​​doing 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:06.670
 About the time we would like it very much. 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:11.439
 that the people enjoy our work 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.870
