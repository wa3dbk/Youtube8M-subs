00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.520
 the control of computer assets and of 2 users who transport them instead of 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.180
 entry to premises and offices is usually a complex task that 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.740
 demand manual controls and many times involved in the process 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.259
 the referir technology can be used to make a greater 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.900
 efficiency in this process 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 ensuring effective control 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.810
 d the people who enter the offices 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.810
 and I know computer equipment is data 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.940
 through the identification of each of these assets 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 with a reference device 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 we can make a reading 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.760
 at each point of defining what is said to control perform a verification 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.480
 automatic that do not require intervention by security personnel 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.130
 stop 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.230
 they assure that the person who has sando 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630
 this transporting 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.670
 only the team 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 let's say that none was assigned 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 the prince the functioning of the system although it feels 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.110
 each team that wants to control a pass well chopped with a double tac 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.590
 frequency 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.260
 additionally every user that because a portable computer 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 will be registered with a radiofrequency credential 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 in case the system will detect the exit of a computer equipment to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.740
 through reading your size refers 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 but we did not get validate an authorized user or transport 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.229
 will report the terror to the system also indicating the personnel of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.140
 security that an unauthorized team is being removed from the premises 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.900
 and avoiding through the blocking of the doors or turnstiles these losses for 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 the company 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.580
 in this way the implementation of technology refers 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.000
 allows to realize a control that effective and automatisms of the users 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.980
 and computer equipment that enter and exit 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.830
 of different office buildings
