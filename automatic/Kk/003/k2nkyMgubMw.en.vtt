going to do here is go and take a look

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to do here is go and take a look
at<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> coverage<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> run

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
at the coverage that we're going to run

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440 
at the coverage that we're going to run
this<00:01:45.990> against<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.790> as<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this against and as you look at it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
this against and as you look at it's
going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> wind<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.170> two<00:01:49.409> men<00:01:49.590> under<00:01:50.010> as

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to wind up being two men under as

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.200 
going to wind up being two men under as
you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.729> screen<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.000> there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you can see on your screen right there

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
you can see on your screen right there
and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.650> wine<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:52.979> having<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then we had wine up having a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then we had wine up having a
bump-and-run<00:01:53.520> man<00:01:53.909> coverage<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.450> these

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
bump-and-run man coverage so these

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.149 
bump-and-run man coverage so these
receivers<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.650> jammed<00:01:55.979> out

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
receivers out here are all jammed out

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.190 
receivers out here are all jammed out
here<00:01:56.400> as<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.759> now<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> things

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here as you look now one of the things

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590 
here as you look now one of the things
with<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.619> particular<00:01:58.890> play<00:01:59.570> unlike<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
with this particular play unlike you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.999 
with this particular play unlike you
some<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.140> gun<00:02:01.350> trips<00:02:01.590> tied<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
some of the other gun trips tied in

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
some of the other gun trips tied in
because<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.580> tide<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.000> does<00:02:03.270> line<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.570> out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because the tide in does line up out

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
because the tide in does line up out
wide<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.799> which<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.310> where<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.520> showed

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
wide over here which is where i showed

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.640 
wide over here which is where i showed
earlier<00:02:05.790> while<00:02:06.210> i<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.299> talking<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.810> then

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
earlier while i was talking about then

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.979 
earlier while i was talking about then
what<00:02:08.220> winds<00:02:08.579> up<00:02:08.670> happening<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.599> inside

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what winds up happening is the inside

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.960 
what winds up happening is the inside
slot<00:02:10.409> receiver<00:02:10.769> generally<00:02:11.280> winds<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.819> getting

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
slot receiver generally winds up getting

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.729 
slot receiver generally winds up getting
matched<00:02:12.299> up<00:02:12.569> against<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.930> linebacker<00:02:13.409> so

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
matched up against a linebacker so

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.069 
matched up against a linebacker so
here's<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.310> here's<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> inside<00:02:15.540> slot

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
here's the here's the inside slot

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.539 
here's the here's the inside slot
receiver<00:02:16.439> right<00:02:16.650> there<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.129> then<00:02:17.250> here's<00:02:17.489> a

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
receiver right there and then here's a

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.039 
receiver right there and then here's a
linebacker<00:02:18.060> that's<00:02:18.329> matched<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.780> against

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
linebacker that's matched up against

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.229 
linebacker that's matched up against
them<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:20.099> generally<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.760> winds<00:02:21.180> up

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
them so that's generally what winds up

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.839 
them so that's generally what winds up
happening<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.110> reason<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:23.280> gives<00:02:23.670> you

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
happening for that reason it gives you

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.670 
happening for that reason it gives you
an<00:02:23.970> advantage

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
an advantage

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.990 
an advantage
on<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:25.010> offensive<00:02:25.189> side<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.819> ball

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
on the offensive side the ball

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.550 
on the offensive side the ball
especially<00:02:26.090> if<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.870> go<00:02:27.019> ahead<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.319> put<00:02:27.439> your

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
especially if you go ahead and put your

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.740 
especially if you go ahead and put your
top<00:02:27.709> receiver<00:02:28.129> or<00:02:28.370> fast<00:02:28.609> receiver<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.239> the

inside slot MERS inside slot position

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.369 
inside slot MERS inside slot position
such<00:02:32.299> as<00:02:32.329> what<00:02:32.599> we're<00:02:32.750> showing<00:02:32.930> here<00:02:33.079> you<00:02:33.260> can

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
such as what we're showing here you can

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.229 
such as what we're showing here you can
package<00:02:33.620> him<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.099> if<00:02:34.219> you<00:02:34.280> want<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.120> can

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
package him in if you want or you can

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.420 
package him in if you want or you can
supplement<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.859> reason<00:02:36.920> it's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
supplement and for that reason it's

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.619 
supplement and for that reason it's
going<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.609> wind<00:02:37.849> up<00:02:38.000> giving<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.450> that

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
going to wind up giving you that

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.300 
going to wind up giving you that
advantage<00:02:39.079> once<00:02:39.409> he<00:02:39.530> comes<00:02:39.680> across<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.250> that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
advantage once he comes across on that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.429 
advantage once he comes across on that
shallow<00:02:40.640> crossing<00:02:40.909> route<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.540> that's<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
shallow crossing route so that's the

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.199 
shallow crossing route so that's the
reason<00:02:42.469> that<00:02:42.859> we<00:02:43.159> wind<00:02:43.519> up<00:02:43.579> running<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:44.000> play

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
reason that we wind up running this play

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.610 
reason that we wind up running this play
and<00:02:44.389> what<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.510> want<00:02:44.719> to<00:02:44.840> show<00:02:44.959> about<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.349> because

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and what I want to show about it because

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.140 
and what I want to show about it because
it's<00:02:45.799> kind<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> cool<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.579> reason<00:02:46.819> so

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's kind of cool for that reason so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.369 
it's kind of cool for that reason so
let's<00:02:47.299> go<00:02:47.389> ahead<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.540> continue<00:02:47.719> on<00:02:48.079> with<00:02:48.230> it

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
let's go ahead and continue on with it

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.080 
let's go ahead and continue on with it
as<00:02:48.530> far<00:02:49.219> as<00:02:49.340> we're<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.700> do<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.909> hot

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
as far as we're going to do with the hot

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.190 
as far as we're going to do with the hot

ahead and do another hot route and
that's<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.419> go<00:03:02.599> ahead<00:03:02.689> and<00:03:03.109> show<00:03:03.439> the<00:03:03.680> middle

route if you want to call it that or

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.429 
route if you want to call it that or
whoop<00:03:08.389> route<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:08.840> he's<00:03:08.989> going<00:03:09.079> to<00:03:09.169> wind<00:03:09.349> up

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
whoop route so he's going to wind up

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.159 
whoop route so he's going to wind up
going<00:03:09.590> out<00:03:09.769> there<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.609> idea<00:03:10.939> this<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
going out there now the idea this is the

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.259 
going out there now the idea this is the
reason<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:12.650> hot<00:03:12.799> rod<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.250> tied<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.030> his

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
reason that we hot rod to tied in on his

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.670 
reason that we hot rod to tied in on his
streak<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.750> let's<00:03:14.930> go<00:03:15.139> and<00:03:15.260> take<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.409> look<00:03:15.469> at

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
streak so let's go and take a look at

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.990 
streak so let's go and take a look at
the<00:03:15.769> tide<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.400> reason<00:03:16.609> that<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:16.849> hot

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the tide in the reason that we hot

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.300 
the tide in the reason that we hot
routed<00:03:17.329> him<00:03:17.389> on<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:17.689> streak<00:03:17.989> here<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.439> what

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
routed him on this streak here is what

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.619 
routed him on this streak here is what
we're<00:03:19.489> trying<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.879> do<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.419> stuff

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
we're trying to do and this is stuff

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.319 
we're trying to do and this is stuff
I've<00:03:20.780> shown<00:03:21.049> before<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.769> years<00:03:22.159> past<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.879> we're

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
I've shown before in years past is we're

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.879 
I've shown before in years past is we're
trying<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.629> draw<00:03:23.840> especially<00:03:24.409> their<00:03:24.560> two-man

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
trying to draw especially their two-man

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.229 
trying to draw especially their two-man
owner<00:03:25.069> we're<00:03:25.280> trying<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.579> draw<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.909> strong

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
owner we're trying to draw this strong

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.520 
owner we're trying to draw this strong
safety<00:03:26.659> deeper<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.169> we're<00:03:27.260> just<00:03:27.290> going<00:03:27.500> to

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
safety deeper so we're just going to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.259 
safety deeper so we're just going to
wind<00:03:27.769> up<00:03:27.889> getting<00:03:28.159> a<00:03:28.189> strong<00:03:28.459> safety<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.150> go

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
wind up getting a strong safety to go

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.210 
wind up getting a strong safety to go
ahead<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.569> drop<00:03:29.780> back<00:03:30.109> into<00:03:30.379> this<00:03:30.560> area<00:03:30.799> here

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
ahead and drop back into this area here

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.490 
ahead and drop back into this area here
and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:32.299> once<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:32.900> receiver<00:03:33.260> which<00:03:33.379> is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
and then once this receiver which is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.659 
and then once this receiver which is
going<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> wind<00:03:33.889> up<00:03:33.979> being<00:03:34.129> Italian<00:03:34.549> he's

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
going to wind up being Italian he's

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.069 
going to wind up being Italian he's
going<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:34.879> force<00:03:35.090> him<00:03:35.269> back<00:03:35.299> now<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.870> idea

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
going to force him back now the idea

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.580 
going to force him back now the idea
that<00:03:36.409> is<00:03:36.919> is<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.639> allow<00:03:38.269> this<00:03:38.720> receiver<00:03:39.169> which

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
that is is to allow this receiver which

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.500 
that is is to allow this receiver which
is<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.859> pointed<00:03:40.250> out<00:03:40.340> earlier<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.909> inside<00:03:41.209> slot

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
is I pointed out earlier the inside slot

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.270 
is I pointed out earlier the inside slot
receiver<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.930> come<00:03:42.109> across<00:03:42.409> on<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:42.739> crossing

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
receiver to come across on that crossing

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.069 
receiver to come across on that crossing
route<00:03:43.459> where<00:03:44.060> he<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.359> get<00:03:44.479> open<00:03:44.780> underneath

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
route where he can get open underneath

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.240 
route where he can get open underneath
and<00:03:45.439> that's<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.680> reason<00:03:45.769> we're<00:03:46.010> doing<00:03:46.129> that

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and that's the reason we're doing that

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.589 
and that's the reason we're doing that
not<00:03:46.579> only<00:03:46.639> is<00:03:46.790> he<00:03:46.879> going<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.060> not<00:03:47.359> only<00:03:47.419> the

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
not only is he going to not only the

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.610 
not only is he going to not only the
tight<00:03:47.780> end<00:03:47.959> going<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.169> take<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.409> strong

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
tight end going to take the strong

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.229 
tight end going to take the strong
safety<00:03:48.859> deep<00:03:49.189> he's<00:03:49.729> going<00:03:49.909> to<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.090> ahead<00:03:50.150> and

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
safety deep he's going to go ahead and

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.960 
safety deep he's going to go ahead and
take<00:03:50.389> his<00:03:50.629> man<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.019> well<00:03:51.229> and<00:03:51.500> hopefully<00:03:52.129> we're

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
take his man as well and hopefully we're

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.129 
take his man as well and hopefully we're
going<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.150> wind<00:03:53.359> up<00:03:53.479> getting<00:03:53.750> as<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.900> talked

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
going to wind up getting as I talked

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.449 
going to wind up getting as I talked
about<00:03:54.319> earlier<00:03:54.590> as<00:03:54.680> his<00:03:54.829> linebackers

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
about earlier as his linebackers

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.159 
about earlier as his linebackers
covering<00:03:55.819> him<00:03:56.000> where<00:03:56.569> he's<00:03:56.659> going<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.870> wind<00:03:57.049> up

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
covering him where he's going to wind up

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.780 
covering him where he's going to wind up
getting<00:03:57.409> behind<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.129> then<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.370> can<00:03:58.489> wind<00:03:58.699> up

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
getting behind and then we can wind up

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.159 
getting behind and then we can wind up
making<00:03:58.939> that<00:03:59.209> throw<00:03:59.419> to<00:03:59.449> him<00:03:59.629> somewhere

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
making that throw to him somewhere

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.199 
making that throw to him somewhere
probably<00:04:01.129> in<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.489> area<00:04:01.729> here<00:04:01.939> we<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.180> make

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
probably in this area here we can make

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.149 
probably in this area here we can make
that<00:04:02.359> throw<00:04:02.780> now<00:04:03.349> there's<00:04:03.620> going<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.889> be<00:04:03.919> some

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
that throw now there's going to be some

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.399 
that throw now there's going to be some
times<00:04:04.430> when<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.000> linebacker<00:04:05.569> doesn't<00:04:06.259> get

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
times when this linebacker doesn't get

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.050 
times when this linebacker doesn't get
behind<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:06.949> that<00:04:07.159> and<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.340> linebacker<00:04:07.729> may

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
behind like that and it's linebacker may

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.179 
behind like that and it's linebacker may
wind<00:04:08.359> up<00:04:08.569> getting<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.019> front<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.439> him<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:09.979> he

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
wind up getting in front of him or he

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.740 
wind up getting in front of him or he
may<00:04:10.340> wind<00:04:10.579> up<00:04:10.729> cutting<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.150> front<00:04:11.419> he<00:04:11.569> might

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
may wind up cutting in front he might

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.479 
may wind up cutting in front he might
pick<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.109> pass<00:04:12.290> off<00:04:12.500> especially<00:04:12.919> got<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> watch

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
pick the pass off especially got a watch

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.530 
pick the pass off especially got a watch
of<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.819> because<00:04:14.000> there's<00:04:14.150> time<00:04:14.329> that's

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
of that because there's time that's

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.390 
of that because there's time that's
going<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> happen<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.680> he<00:04:15.799> may<00:04:15.919> not<00:04:16.099> want<00:04:16.159> to

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
going to happen and he may not want to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.219 
going to happen and he may not want to
throw<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.669> ball<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.780> kind<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.079> goes

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
throw that ball so that kind of goes

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.050 
throw that ball so that kind of goes
back<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.829> what<00:04:18.979> we<00:04:19.070> did<00:04:19.159> earlier<00:04:19.220> at<00:04:19.849> least

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
back to what we did earlier at least

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.430 
back to what we did earlier at least
with<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> other<00:04:20.419> hot<00:04:20.630> rod<00:04:20.810> adjustment<00:04:21.079> that

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
with the other hot rod adjustment that

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.140 
with the other hot rod adjustment that
we<00:04:21.560> made<00:04:21.829> where<00:04:22.220> we<00:04:22.370> went<00:04:22.520> ahead<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:22.820> hot

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
we made where we went ahead and hot

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.610 
we made where we went ahead and hot
routed<00:04:23.509> this<00:04:23.630> receiver<00:04:23.990> here<00:04:24.169> when<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.409> talked

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
routed this receiver here when we talked

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.350 
routed this receiver here when we talked
about<00:04:24.770> hot<00:04:25.009> routing<00:04:25.340> him<00:04:25.490> on<00:04:25.669> his<00:04:25.909> zigzag

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
about hot routing him on his zigzag

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.499 
about hot routing him on his zigzag
which<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.380> middle<00:04:27.770> slot<00:04:27.979> receiver<00:04:28.509> so

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
which is the middle slot receiver so

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:30.939 
which is the middle slot receiver so
what<00:04:29.659> we're<00:04:29.840> looking<00:04:30.020> for<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:30.229> is<00:04:30.560> once<00:04:30.830> he

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
what we're looking for here is once he

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.980 
what we're looking for here is once he
breaks<00:04:31.159> towards<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.520> sideline<00:04:31.759> if<00:04:32.150> we<00:04:32.690> feel

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
breaks towards the sideline if we feel

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.570 
breaks towards the sideline if we feel
that<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.320> inside<00:04:33.650> slot<00:04:33.950> receiver<00:04:34.279> is<00:04:34.430> not

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
that the inside slot receiver is not

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.170 
that the inside slot receiver is not
open<00:04:34.969> then<00:04:35.719> as<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.229> quarterback<00:04:36.529> what<00:04:36.919> we

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
open then as the quarterback what we

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.580 
open then as the quarterback what we
do<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.509> we<00:04:37.720> can<00:04:37.840> go<00:04:37.990> ahead<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.169> look<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.440> throw

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
do is we can go ahead and look to throw

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.020 
do is we can go ahead and look to throw
with<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.889> guy<00:04:39.100> over<00:04:39.280> here<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.729> that's<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
with this guy over here and that's the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.640 
with this guy over here and that's the
idea<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.050> gives<00:04:41.139> us<00:04:41.289> another

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
idea of that so it gives us another

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370 
idea of that so it gives us another
option<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.250> throw<00:04:42.280> too<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.330> case<00:04:43.389> the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
option to throw too just in case the

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.590 
option to throw too just in case the
inside<00:04:44.800> slot<00:04:45.160> receiver<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:46.120> there<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.389> one

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
inside slot receiver and there is one

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.300 
inside slot receiver and there is one
other<00:04:46.630> option<00:04:46.870> we<00:04:47.259> can<00:04:47.380> throw<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.680> as<00:04:47.949> well<00:04:48.160> and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
other option we can throw to as well and

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.469 
other option we can throw to as well and
that's<00:04:48.370> going<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.639> wind<00:04:48.940> up<00:04:49.120> being<00:04:49.360> the

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
that's going to wind up being the

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.790 
that's going to wind up being the
running<00:04:49.750> back<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:50.080> he<00:04:50.229> comes<00:04:50.440> out<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
running back as he comes out the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.200 
running back as he comes out the
backfield<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.490> angle<00:04:51.669> right<00:04:51.910> on<00:04:52.060> that

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
backfield on that angle right on that

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.600 
backfield on that angle right on that
delayed<00:04:52.449> angle<00:04:52.780> route<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.500> no<00:04:53.830> one's<00:04:54.009> open<00:04:54.220> and

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
delayed angle route so no one's open and

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.159 
delayed angle route so no one's open and
we<00:04:54.729> see<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.000> guy<00:04:55.210> coming<00:04:55.240> out<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.780> he<00:04:55.870> winds

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
we see this guy coming out and he winds

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.749 
we see this guy coming out and he winds
up<00:04:56.259> coming<00:04:56.530> across<00:04:56.710> in<00:04:57.009> this<00:04:57.130> area<00:04:57.370> here<00:04:57.580> he

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
up coming across in this area here he

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.279 
up coming across in this area here he
should<00:04:57.940> wind<00:04:58.240> up<00:04:58.330> being<00:04:58.509> matched<00:04:58.780> up<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
should wind up being matched up with the

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.990 
should wind up being matched up with the
linebacker<00:04:59.830> will<00:05:00.100> put<00:05:00.550> them<00:05:00.639> in<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:00.820> guy

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
linebacker will put them in this guy

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.760 
linebacker will put them in this guy
here<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.270> middle<00:05:01.449> linebacker<00:05:01.600> he<00:05:02.500> should<00:05:02.740> be

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
here the middle linebacker he should be

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.930 
here the middle linebacker he should be
lined<00:05:03.100> up<00:05:03.250> where<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.430> middle<00:05:03.610> linebacker

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
lined up where the middle linebacker

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.550 
lined up where the middle linebacker
comes<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:04.330> this<00:05:04.419> area<00:05:04.690> here<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.080> then<00:05:05.289> as<00:05:05.440> the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
comes in this area here and then as the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.499 
comes in this area here and then as the
quarterback<00:05:05.919> if<00:05:06.729> we<00:05:06.850> don't<00:05:07.000> see<00:05:07.120> our<00:05:07.240> first

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
quarterback if we don't see our first

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.110 
quarterback if we don't see our first
couple<00:05:08.289> options<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:08.770> are<00:05:08.860> open<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.550> then

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
couple options that are open and then

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.909 
couple options that are open and then
what<00:05:10.330> we<00:05:10.419> can<00:05:10.449> wind<00:05:10.870> up<00:05:10.930> doing<00:05:11.139> here<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.680> one

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
what we can wind up doing here is one

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.140 
what we can wind up doing here is one
that<00:05:11.949> making<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.460> throw<00:05:12.610> into<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:12.970> area

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
that making that throw into that area

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.969 
that making that throw into that area
there<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:13.599> we<00:05:13.720> have<00:05:13.840> those<00:05:14.050> three<00:05:14.349> options<00:05:14.830> to

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
there so we have those three options to

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.520 
there so we have those three options to
look<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.220> throw<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:16.389> go<00:05:16.599> ahead<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:17.110> attack

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
look to throw to to go ahead and attack

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.110 
look to throw to to go ahead and attack
this<00:05:17.830> particular<00:05:18.099> coverage<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:18.759> as<00:05:18.880> far<00:05:19.060> as

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
this particular coverage so as far as

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.460 
this particular coverage so as far as
reading<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.509> coverage<00:05:19.810> would<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:20.110> something

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
reading the coverage would be something

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.529 
reading the coverage would be something
like<00:05:20.590> this<00:05:20.889> we<00:05:21.490> probably<00:05:21.669> make<00:05:21.849> my<00:05:22.060> number<00:05:22.389> one

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
like this we probably make my number one

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.600 
like this we probably make my number one
read<00:05:22.780> which<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.080> going<00:05:23.199> to<00:05:23.259> be<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.800> inside

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
read which is going to be the inside

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.040 
read which is going to be the inside
slot<00:05:24.940> receiver<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.539> guy<00:05:25.720> would<00:05:25.870> be<00:05:25.960> our

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
slot receiver this guy would be our
