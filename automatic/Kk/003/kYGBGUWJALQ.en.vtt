00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.620
 or both of us finally christians finally 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.630
 I have order the new ones and for those who 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
 follow on twitter and you will know 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.840
 uploading enough photos and things is a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 computer made by parts and good here 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.029
 what you have is the box is pretty cool 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 It's cheap, but I do not know, it's very 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.079
 pretty many more visited also by 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.380
 twitter that some of you have this box and 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.749
 but it's cool to me, not a lot, and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 well much more the computer inside 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.980
 because seriously after so many 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 time playing with bad computer no 6 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 what is playing at 500 fps or 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.269
 well I'll teach it if inside that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.309
 As you can see, the first thing that stands out 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.379
 is that piece of heatsink that's there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.860
 what is this here which was 50 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.829
 euros and is below the processor that is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.220
 an intel core i5 is a 4,690 here is it 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 the last and five that have come out and good 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.799
 what you are lower card 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.300
 graphic and these two here are those of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.300
 the graphics card is a gtx 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.830
 750 and the branches of 8gb are two as 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.830
 all are 4 gb each 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.860
 and basically the intel core i5 is 3.5 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.450
 gigahertz but with the dissipating piece 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.329
 what ais 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.570
 I could put it to 42 and it looks like a 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.759
 perfect to no problem and good 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.810
 now what what you are seeing I think 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.740
 that one of the most important things 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 apart from the heatsink is the ssp of 120 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.560
 gigas that makes the fingers go 10 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.600
 faster times 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.149
 I do not know how he does not owe how 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.850
 that piece works but it's the cane 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.399
 that in fact thanks to that I could 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 put my minecraft at 6000 fps is in a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.990
 flat world with everything in minimum but the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 6000 after all, I'm not going to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.280
 back to doing so exposes a photo 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.160
 because it has to be terrible for the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.220
 Graphic Imagine 6000 frames each 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.650
 second, a lot of work 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 and also thanks to s it looks like reese 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.380
 see is understood as in 5 seconds no 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.630
 I am very little and the truth is that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.510
 I am very happy with my computer 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.060
 new right now minecraft like 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.530
 too easy but it's not easy basic 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.030
 but seriously it's a pleasure to play 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 always to all the fps is that he wants and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.990
 the funny thing is that he's going to buy me a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.910
 which makes me get all the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.070
 internet to my room and everything in 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.480
 internet is 120 megs so now 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.310
 I will have 120 megs and 500 fps are the ones 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 minus the limits 120 because I need it 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.069
 plus 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.049
 and we go with that today in a 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.280
 server try pl I look at one wrong and already 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.200
 is dead I do not need to do more 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.130
 but hey I'm so when starting 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.620
 now we come to be like 1080 60 fps 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.360
 if I get it because the 2 60 fps is there 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.880
 it's crappy because I'm also very 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.819
 programs and such but I'm going to get it 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.579
 so you can see the same quality 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.139
 and well this is all I hope we 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.359
 we see in many videos a very good 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.359
 quality so until next time
