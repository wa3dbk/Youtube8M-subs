watercolors<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:26.080> had<00:04:26.500> been<00:04:26.800> had<00:04:27.729> some<00:04:27.910> time

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
watercolors and I had been had some time

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.270 
watercolors and I had been had some time
off<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.660> started<00:04:29.140> taking<00:04:29.560> up<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.919> murdery

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
off so I started taking up a murdery

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.800 
off so I started taking up a murdery
again<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.789> thought<00:04:31.030> one<00:04:31.240> day<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.630> put

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
again and I thought one day that I put

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.350 
again and I thought one day that I put
some<00:04:31.960> lines<00:04:32.140> together

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.360 

I<00:04:37.659> think<00:04:38.659> the<00:04:38.780> first<00:04:39.020> year<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.379> exhibiting<00:04:40.099> at

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
I think the first year of exhibiting at

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.520 
I think the first year of exhibiting at
an<00:04:40.520> international<00:04:41.150> licensing<00:04:41.599> show<00:04:41.870> was

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
probably the best thing there was I was

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:43.990 
probably the best thing there was I was
very<00:04:54.650> encouraging<00:05:42.069> one<00:05:43.069> thing<00:05:43.460> that<00:05:43.759> I<00:05:43.789> would

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
very encouraging one thing that I would

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.070 
very encouraging one thing that I would
