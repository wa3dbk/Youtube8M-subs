00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.850 

I<00:00:06.680> think<00:00:07.340> we<00:00:07.580> got<00:00:07.609> in<00:00:08.080> more<00:00:09.080> rhythm<00:00:09.559> we<00:00:09.740> had

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
I think we got in more rhythm we had

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.350 
I think we got in more rhythm we had
more<00:00:10.010> opportunity<00:00:10.519> to<00:00:10.580> drive<00:00:10.850> the<00:00:10.969> ball<00:00:11.030> down

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
more opportunity to drive the ball down

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.510 
more opportunity to drive the ball down
the<00:00:11.450> field<00:00:11.770> had<00:00:12.770> a<00:00:12.799> couple<00:00:13.010> three-and-outs

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
the field had a couple three-and-outs

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.109 
the field had a couple three-and-outs
that<00:00:13.910> that<00:00:14.299> hurt<00:00:14.510> us<00:00:14.660> in<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:14.990> first<00:00:15.680> half<00:00:16.119> but

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
that that hurt us in the first half but

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.490 
that that hurt us in the first half but
for<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.330> most<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.630> our<00:00:17.810> defense<00:00:18.140> was<00:00:18.230> giving

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
for the most of our defense was giving

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.840 
for the most of our defense was giving
us<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.710> short<00:00:18.920> field<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:19.460> we<00:00:19.490> were<00:00:19.640> only<00:00:19.730> having

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
us a short field so we were only having

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.870 
us a short field so we were only having
four<00:00:20.300> or<00:00:20.420> five<00:00:20.570> play<00:00:20.810> drives<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:21.730> second<00:00:22.730> half

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
four or five play drives so second half

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.909 
four or five play drives so second half
we<00:00:23.119> actually<00:00:23.449> got<00:00:23.570> in<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.750> rhythm<00:00:23.929> got<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.740> drive

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919

starting now yeah why's it going into

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.780 
starting now yeah why's it going into
that<00:00:34.670> drive<00:00:34.970> oh<00:00:35.829> we<00:00:36.829> knew<00:00:36.950> that<00:00:36.980> if<00:00:37.489> we<00:00:37.520> went

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
that drive oh we knew that if we went

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.390 
that drive oh we knew that if we went
out<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.090> executed<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.130> came<00:00:40.130> out<00:00:40.220> with<00:00:40.280> to

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
get drive and scored it help with our

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.550 
get drive and scored it help with our
momentum<00:00:43.880> because<00:00:44.240> they<00:00:44.450> kind<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.750> got<00:00:45.500> a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
momentum because they kind of got a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.080 
momentum because they kind of got a
little<00:00:45.650> bit<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:45.920> momentum<00:00:46.070> back<00:00:46.460> late<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:46.880> the

big thing having that chemistry people

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.910 
big thing having that chemistry people
like<00:01:15.829> you<00:01:16.039> were<00:01:16.130> struggling<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:17.859> wouldn't<00:01:18.859> say

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
like you were struggling I wouldn't say

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.770 
like you were struggling I wouldn't say
I<00:01:19.009> was<00:01:19.070> struggling<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:20.119> had<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> couple<00:01:20.420> drops

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
I was struggling we had a couple drops

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.849 
I was struggling we had a couple drops
that<00:01:21.229> hurt<00:01:23.350> couldn't<00:01:24.350> really<00:01:24.469> get<00:01:24.679> in<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
that hurt couldn't really get in the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.059 
that hurt couldn't really get in the
rhythm<00:01:25.069> just<00:01:25.700> based<00:01:26.359> on<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.770> number<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.799> plays

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
rhythm just based on the number of plays

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.550 
rhythm just based on the number of plays
we<00:01:28.249> had<00:01:28.429> I<00:01:28.460> think<00:01:28.729> we<00:01:28.819> only<00:01:28.939> had<00:01:29.109> nine<00:01:30.109> or<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.409> it

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
we had I think we only had nine or so it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.219 
we had I think we only had nine or so it
plays<00:01:30.829> in<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.069> 1st<00:01:31.249> first<00:01:31.999> quarter<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:32.659> not

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
plays in the 1st first quarter so not

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.559 
plays in the 1st first quarter so not
the<00:01:33.380> only<00:01:33.499> gonna<00:01:33.649> rhythm<00:01:34.039> never<00:01:34.850> helps<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.509> I

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
the only gonna rhythm never helps but I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.520 
the only gonna rhythm never helps but I
didn't<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.929> don't<00:01:36.109> feel<00:01:36.229> like<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.409> was

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
didn't I don't feel like I was

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.300 
didn't I don't feel like I was
struggling<00:01:36.889> how<00:01:37.549> frustrating<00:01:38.179> was<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.359> to<00:01:38.719> go

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.310 

it<00:01:42.310> hurts<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.850> hurts<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.780> be<00:01:43.990> able<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.200> keep

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
it hurts it hurts not be able to keep

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.810 
it hurts it hurts not be able to keep
drives<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.939> then<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.159> having

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
drives going and and then kind of having

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.539 
drives going and and then kind of having
our<00:01:48.939> hand<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.420> third<00:01:49.630> down<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.549> bloody

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
our hand on third down so bloody

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.510 
our hand on third down so bloody
improvement<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:54.250> think<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:56.680> into<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.070> half

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
improvement I think going into a half

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.429 
improvement I think going into a half
time<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:58.000> make<00:01:58.360> adjustments<00:01:58.990> based<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.289> what

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
time you make adjustments based on what

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.719 
time you make adjustments based on what
you're<00:01:59.590> seeing<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.950> things<00:02:00.159> like<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.670> I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
you're seeing and things like that and I

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
you're seeing and things like that and I
think<00:02:00.759> coach<00:02:01.090> Jake<00:02:01.330> did<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.539> great<00:02:01.750> job<00:02:01.780> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

Jones<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.910> think<00:03:54.720> he's<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> pretty<00:03:55.340> level<00:03:56.340> guy<00:03:56.700> in

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
Jones I think he's a pretty level guy in

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.210 
Jones I think he's a pretty level guy in
terms<00:03:57.599> of<00:03:57.720> energy<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.380> things<00:03:58.590> like<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.739> he

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
terms of energy and things like that he

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.069 
terms of energy and things like that he
brings<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.180> hundred<00:04:00.330> percent<00:04:00.480> every<00:04:00.780> day<00:04:01.019> so

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
brings it a hundred percent every day so

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.660 
brings it a hundred percent every day so
I<00:04:01.380> don't<00:04:01.650> know<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:01.890> you'll<00:04:02.010> see<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> whole<00:04:02.640> lot

it's<00:05:35.460> just<00:05:35.699> knowing<00:05:35.880> our<00:05:36.090> coach<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.330> going<00:05:36.630> to

it's<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.919> huge<00:05:41.639> testament<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.659> way<00:05:42.750> we
