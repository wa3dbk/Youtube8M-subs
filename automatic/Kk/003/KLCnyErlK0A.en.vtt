00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 if there is a word to define 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.969
 shapes 3 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.740
 this word would be the alternative the game 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 arrives with the mission of being an option 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 saturn on the market 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.330
 meanwhile his plot is about 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
 absence of options and the obligation to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 fight to save one's life 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.610
 with ubisoft game shows the one that came 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.050
 wants to tamper with the limits of sanity 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 showing how far you can reach 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 cruelty of a villain and which 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.570
 barriers that someone can break but 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.570

 is fighting or connected to this is one of 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.220
 worst games of the year 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.549
 open world games are notorious for 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 their faults thanks 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.229
 fortunately almost none of this is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 present in bill three presenting 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 a heavenly and amazing environment 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 huge to be explored 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 You'll be lost on this island without 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.050
 sound two minutes you will have shapes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.390
 extremely varied ways of exploring 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.119
 this space at your disposal are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 vehicles like cars quadricycles 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 boats and a lucky so can you 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720

 allow you and from the side to the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.140
 one more quickly or flee 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.759
 of enemy attacks 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.770
 gigantic world of formula 3 is also 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.770
 absurdly high by animals 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.149
 everything is useful to the flora besides being 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 and some campaign missions 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.899
 is used for the manufacture of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 or special formulas already carcasses 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.670
 animals can be used for breeding 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.440
 de luxe squids wallets or purses that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 allow the player to charge and more 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.849
 ammunition money or items that later 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.709
 must be sold 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.200
 the number of objectives to be 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.959
 completed easily arrives at the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.870
 hundreds of software you abandon 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.090
 Your life and head diving in this 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 adventure ensures many hours of play 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.989
 If you're in the mood and believe it, it's not 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.819
 Nothing difficult to happen. 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.920
 the dubbing work captures 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.300
 far cry 3 facial expressions deserve 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.489
 all the compliments 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.680
 the interpretation of the characters is great 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.140
 extremely amazing INPC is 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.120
 enough personality that react from the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.730
 appropriate manner the situations 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 the great title star is the villain vaz 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.560
 see the cyrus and extremely realistic 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.700
 I watched some scenes with him, the people 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.620
 do not feel bothered 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.590
 it is also easy to see reflected in the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.300
 characters of the game in focus is 3 you do not 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.819
 is in charge of highly 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.680
 trained but rather from a person like 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.010
 any of us who are in 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.300
 a situation of despair is clear 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.099
 We're in a game. 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
 so our protagonist is highly 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.870
 skillful but still their reactions 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.019
 they are normal people and you will see 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.940
 involved very quickly and deeply 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.830
 even though the campaign mode is 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.870
 interesting in today's world is 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.950
 multiplayer that defines the longevity of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.900
 a first person shooter game 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.480
 cry 3 is very well served in this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.760
 bringing together ideas of success and 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.620
 indispensable concepts with novelties 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.410
 that catch the attention of those looking for something 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.989
 new 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.269
 the co-operative mode resembles very light for 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.310
 that here you are in control of 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.650
 four very distinct mercenaries in one 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.269
 series of spinoff missions that happen 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.840
 months before the events of history 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.579
 main campaigns aimed at 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.010
 gameplay with up to four people 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.870
 mix action scenes with excerpts from 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.459
 competition but the beast really catches 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.530
 in conventional multiplayer 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.049
 the vast majority of scenarios are 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.450
 open and requires a more careful style 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.250
 and different from playing modules 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.169
 as well as the conquest of 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.989
 territories or traditional forest 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.940
 go hand in hand with novelties such as 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.060
 chemical weapons and a system that releases 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.039
 tickets to the guns even the neighborhoods 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.450
 rural areas that improve energy 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.389
 speed of all comrades 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.850
 special advantages in the fight against 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.979
 before the team tite can be 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.139
 only those who go deeper in 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.900
 focus at 3 will realize why this is a 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.400
 different from the others are not just 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.889
 the vast open world 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.630
 the newness of multiplayer and the performance of 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.110
 characters that make it a game 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.000
 special ideas and small ideas also 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.410
 to put the title in the minds of 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.570
 players 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.760
 one example of this is the system that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.560
 the campus of multiplayer mode that display 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.650
 graphics with the position of opponents and 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.650
 bullet trajectories a healing method 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.720
 also deserves special mention 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.419
 player ripping off arm bullet with 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.550
 own teeth by applying bandages or 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.889
 putting broken fingers back in the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.410
 place also acquired the skills 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.630
 are directly linked to the body of the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.310
 protagonist with tattoos that are being 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.539
 applied and transformed into a 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.539
 true warrior 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.340
 despite escaping many of the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.830
 graphics problems in games 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.810
 of the open world far cry 3 could not 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.180
 get away from the bugs that always amaudson 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.190
 titles in this style 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.720
 programming failures reach 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.789
 frequency the mode 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.410
 multiplayer and can annoy those 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.410
 players who do not have a lot of patience 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.669
 in our tests we were stuck in 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.889
 stones that can not move the 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.050
 character or resurfacing outside the area 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.289
 which caused deaths 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.539
 the cooperative mode 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.970
 loaded with the protagonists 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.460
 but the mission was never started 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.169
 all were forced to disconnect and 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.169
 these are just a few examples 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.470
 while the focus is 3 came to show 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.300
 that ubisoft is still able to create 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.620
 Little wonders in the gaming world 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.870
 electronics 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.270
 the title is recommended for anyone 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.700
 who likes games and not just fans of 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.190
 franchise or fps players 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.050
 we have here a very strong candidate for 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.170
 best game of the year and a game that 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.600
 pretty close to being flawless 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.490
 were not the serious problems of the egg of 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.190
 to see that they deeply 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.470
 title gameplay goes 3 could 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.350
 be applying for a maximum grade 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.510
 here you can find the complete package and 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.750
 without doubt a title that is worth 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.980
 every cent spent on your purchase
