00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
need to talk about are the three most

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
need to talk about are the three most
common<00:01:27.659> valve<00:01:28.380> spring<00:01:28.799> retainers<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
common valve spring retainers that

common valve spring retainers that
you'll<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.090> small<00:01:30.360> engines<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you'll see on these small engines and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
you'll see on these small engines and
you<00:01:31.560> need<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.430> you're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you need to know that when you're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
you need to know that when you're
working<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.360> valve<00:01:34.110> spring

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
working with that valve spring

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.149 
working with that valve spring
compressor<00:01:34.470> tool<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.470> valve<00:01:38.009> spring

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
compressor tool so what a valve spring

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
compressor tool so what a valve spring
retainer<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> locks<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> valve

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
retainer does is it locks the valve

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.730 
retainer does is it locks the valve
spring<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> valve<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> first<00:01:43.530> type

of valve spring retainer I want to talk

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.350 
of valve spring retainer I want to talk
about<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> called<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> keyhole<00:01:46.590> retainer<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
about is called a keyhole retainer and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
about is called a keyhole retainer and
it's<00:01:48.360> called<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.250> opening

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's called that because it the opening

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's called that because it the opening
here<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.970> shaped<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> keyhole<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
here is shaped like a keyhole and the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
here is shaped like a keyhole and the
way<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.310> works<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> slips<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
way that it works is it slips over the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
way that it works is it slips over the
valve<00:01:55.049> stem<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.890> slips<00:01:56.189> into<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
valve stem and then it slips into that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630 
valve stem and then it slips into that
valve<00:01:56.969> spring<00:01:57.899> retainer<00:01:58.290> groove<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.890> it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
valve spring retainer groove and it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
valve spring retainer groove and it
locks<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:01.040> valve<00:02:02.040> spring<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> valve<00:02:03.469> in

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
locks the valve spring to the valve in

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.600 
locks the valve spring to the valve in
the<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.820> smaller<00:02:06.390> small<00:02:07.350> engines<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the on the smaller small engines this is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.160 
the on the smaller small engines this is
the<00:02:08.729> most<00:02:08.879> common<00:02:09.360> type<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.569> valve<00:02:09.899> spring

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the most common type of valve spring

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.990 
the most common type of valve spring
retainer<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.910> it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
retainer you see and I think it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.470 
retainer you see and I think it's
because<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.480> cheaper<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.870> manufacture

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
because it's cheaper to manufacture

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.350 
because it's cheaper to manufacture
sure<00:02:13.659> but<00:02:14.379> they're<00:02:15.159> not<00:02:15.310> as<00:02:15.489> strong<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.269> when

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
sure but they're not as strong and when

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.670 
sure but they're not as strong and when
you<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.510> into<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> bigger<00:02:17.080> engines<00:02:17.560> you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you get into the bigger engines you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.509 
you get into the bigger engines you
start<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.099> see<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.930> split<00:02:20.200> collar<00:02:20.470> type<00:02:20.860> valve

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
start to see the split collar type valve

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.220 
start to see the split collar type valve
spring<00:02:21.790> retainer<00:02:22.120> which<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.599> will<00:02:22.780> talk<00:02:22.930> about

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
spring retainer which I will talk about

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.670 
spring retainer which I will talk about
next<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.299> split<00:02:25.810> collar<00:02:26.049> retainer<00:02:26.530> you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
next for the split collar retainer you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.570 
next for the split collar retainer you
have<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.400> split<00:02:28.360> collars<00:02:28.930> which<00:02:29.530> I'll<00:02:29.769> show

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
have to split collars which I'll show

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.910 
have to split collars which I'll show
you<00:02:30.610> here<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> correct

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
you here and I don't have the correct

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.559 
you here and I don't have the correct
valve<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:33.730> split<00:02:34.000> collars<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.510> I

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
valve for these split collars but I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.330 
valve for these split collars but I
think<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.989> make<00:02:35.170> do<00:02:35.379> with<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.769> valve<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
think I can make do with this valve and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.400 
think I can make do with this valve and
show<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.239> how<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.510> works

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
show you how it works

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
show you how it works
they<00:02:38.650> fit<00:02:38.890> inside<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.549> valve<00:02:40.060> spring

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
they fit inside of the valve spring

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.640 
they fit inside of the valve spring
retainer<00:02:40.750> groove<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
retainer groove kind of like this and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.119 
retainer groove kind of like this and
you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.340> see<00:02:48.579> here<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:50.560> end<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.920> these

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
you can see here that one end of these

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.900 
you can see here that one end of these
split<00:02:51.849> collar<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:53.129> wider<00:02:54.129> than<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.519> other<00:02:54.670> end

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
split collar is wider than the other end

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.729 
split collar is wider than the other end
and<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.450> does<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.049> prevents<00:02:56.440> this

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
and what that does is it prevents this

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.979 
and what that does is it prevents this
valve<00:02:57.400> spring<00:02:57.760> retainer<00:02:58.150> from<00:02:58.359> slipping<00:02:58.840> off

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
valve spring retainer from slipping off

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.970 
valve spring retainer from slipping off
the<00:02:59.019> end<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.349> the<00:03:01.109> valve<00:03:02.109> stem<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.709> locks

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the end of the valve stem and it locks

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.960 
the end of the valve stem and it locks
the<00:03:03.160> spring<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.269> valve<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.340> next<00:03:09.849> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the spring to the valve the next and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.699 
the spring to the valve the next and
last<00:03:10.030> type<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.629> valve<00:03:10.810> spring<00:03:11.079> retainer<00:03:11.440> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
last type of valve spring retainer is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.190 
last type of valve spring retainer is
called<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.040> pin<00:03:12.280> retainer<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:13.329> don't<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.079> an

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
called a pin retainer I don't have an

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.440 
called a pin retainer I don't have an
example<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> drew<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:15.940> up<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.329> on

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
example of that so I drew one up here on

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.259 
example of that so I drew one up here on
this<00:03:16.569> paper<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.950> my<00:03:18.190> drawing<00:03:18.549> this<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this paper in my drawing this is the

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.900 
this paper in my drawing this is the
valve<00:03:19.900> stem<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.560> instead<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.639> groove

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
valve stem and instead of a groove

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.360 
valve stem and instead of a groove
they've<00:03:22.389> drilled<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> hole<00:03:23.200> where<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:23.919> pin

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
they've drilled the hole where a pin

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
they've drilled the hole where a pin
fits<00:03:24.639> through<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.299> pin<00:03:25.630> prevents<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
fits through and this pin prevents the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.680 
fits through and this pin prevents the
valve<00:03:26.859> spring<00:03:27.160> retainer<00:03:27.519> from<00:03:27.730> slipping<00:03:28.569> off

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
valve spring retainer from slipping off

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.830 
valve spring retainer from slipping off
the<00:03:28.840> end<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.169> valve<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.000> thus<00:03:31.000> locks<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the end of the valve and thus locks the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.789 
the end of the valve and thus locks the
valve<00:03:32.169> spring<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.340> valve<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.590> now<00:03:35.739> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
valve spring to the valve so now that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.229 
valve spring to the valve so now that
you<00:03:35.919> know<00:03:35.980> which<00:03:36.250> valve<00:03:36.549> spring<00:03:36.880> retainer

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
of the keyhole is facing out and then

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.880 
of the keyhole is facing out and then
compress<00:04:26.409> the<00:04:26.680> spring

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.890 

and<00:04:35.890> then<00:04:36.610> once<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.090> have<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.450> spring

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
and then once you have the spring

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.740 
and then once you have the spring
compressed<00:04:38.470> if<00:04:39.130> your<00:04:39.460> spring<00:04:39.910> assembly<00:04:40.360> uses

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
compressed if your spring assembly uses

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.500 
compressed if your spring assembly uses
the<00:04:40.960> valve<00:04:41.320> spring<00:04:41.710> seat<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:43.120> might<00:04:43.330> have

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
the valve spring seat you might have

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.510 
the valve spring seat you might have
trouble<00:04:43.780> inserting<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> valve<00:04:44.890> stem<00:04:45.220> through

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
trouble inserting the valve stem through

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.510 
trouble inserting the valve stem through
the<00:04:45.730> assembly<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:47.260> check<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.370> can

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
the assembly so check that and you can

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.540 
the assembly so check that and you can
see<00:04:48.760> here<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.410> at<00:04:50.650> such<00:04:50.920> a<00:04:50.950> great<00:04:51.220> angle

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
see here that it's at such a great angle

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.840 
see here that it's at such a great angle
it<00:04:52.560> won't<00:04:53.560> allow<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.920> valve<00:04:54.280> stem<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.730> go

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
it won't allow the valve stem to go

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.970 
it won't allow the valve stem to go
through<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.540> what<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.080> have<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.380> do<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.650> correct

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
through so what I have to do to correct

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.510 
through so what I have to do to correct
that<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.490> move<00:04:57.820> this<00:04:58.060> whole<00:04:58.360> end<00:04:59.340> of<00:05:00.340> this

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
that is move this whole end of this

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.090 
that is move this whole end of this
valve<00:05:01.000> spring<00:05:01.330> assembly<00:05:01.840> over<00:05:02.020> like<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.740> so

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.620 

that<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.220> angle<00:05:06.340> isn't<00:05:06.700> is<00:05:06.910> great<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.540> I'm

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
that the angle isn't is great and I'm

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.040 
that the angle isn't is great and I'm
able<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.990> insert<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:09.300> valve<00:05:10.300> stem<00:05:10.660> through

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
so you have your compressed valve spring

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.879 
so you have your compressed valve spring
assembly<00:07:07.509> inside<00:07:08.110> of<00:07:08.229> your<00:07:08.379> valve<00:07:08.589> spring

assembly inside of your valve spring

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.379 
assembly inside of your valve spring
chamber<00:07:09.309> you<00:07:09.459> insert<00:07:09.819> your<00:07:09.969> valve<00:07:10.270> stem

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
chamber you insert your valve stem

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.040 
chamber you insert your valve stem
through<00:07:10.809> the<00:07:10.990> assembly<00:07:11.499> and<00:07:12.659> you<00:07:13.659> can<00:07:13.809> use

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
through the assembly and you can use

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.549 
through the assembly and you can use
grease<00:07:14.499> on<00:07:14.830> the<00:07:15.610> split<00:07:15.969> collars<00:07:16.389> and<00:07:16.629> the<00:07:16.689> pin

00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:17.559 
grease on the split collars and the pin

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.219

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:20.229 
retainer to hold them in place you just

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:23.059 
retainer to hold them in place you just
put<00:07:20.469> a<00:07:20.499> little<00:07:20.649> dab<00:07:20.889> of<00:07:21.069> grease<00:07:21.159> on<00:07:21.490> them<00:07:21.729> and

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
put a little dab of grease on them and

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.619 
put a little dab of grease on them and
that<00:07:24.069> will<00:07:24.339> hold<00:07:24.610> them<00:07:25.050> in<00:07:26.050> place<00:07:27.569> while<00:07:28.569> you

that will hold them in place while you

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.199 
that will hold them in place while you
release<00:07:29.289> the<00:07:29.499> tension<00:07:29.740> in<00:07:30.129> your<00:07:30.189> valve<00:07:30.879> spring

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:31.209 
release the tension in your valve spring

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.679 
release the tension in your valve spring
pool<00:07:32.219> so<00:07:33.219> that<00:07:33.249> is<00:07:33.580> how<00:07:33.729> you<00:07:33.789> use<00:07:33.969> a<00:07:34.209> valve

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:34.689 
pool so that is how you use a valve

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:37.109
