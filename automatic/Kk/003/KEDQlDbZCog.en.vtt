00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.160
 go for barley because you are 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.740
 delicious and super nutritious 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.230
 you got the dietary scale of the 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.710
 Pearl barley well that is this veranito 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.930
 that could be similar to the rose me 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.580
 you could give the like to that could 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.850
 know it to study wheat is a 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.010
 little bit more brown having been very 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.769
 rich in that preparation so we're going 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.580
 do we arrest the desire in a 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.369
 skillet 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.140
 like all risotto with a little bit of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.340
 new and butter and I'm going to start 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.239
 studying an onion remembering 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.390
 since two Sundays we were in 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.239
 Cordoba is awaited in lions and we made 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.239
 a floor because the science of orders 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.129
 it's spectacular you can make the risotto 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.059
 encourage you to do it with other grains 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.980
 we have also done it continuously and it remains 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.350
 very good very good boyacÃ¡ 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
 then butter olive oil 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.049
 I have onions with an onion 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.420
 reaches more or less minced and we're going 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:15.659
 crying over here we will not help you 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.659
 little I like it a lot but a lot 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.190
 these can look very special like this 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.080
 the onions I added a 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.540
 little bit of disgust if you want, you do it 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 and if they can not be minced just more 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 easy not here up 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150
 on 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 it's the very rich preparation just 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.700
 Portista in the questions 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.250
 rich in this preparation can be 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.620
 replace quietly or I do not know what 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.840
 you put you do it you must only hell 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.520
 with anything I have done in the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.340
 program other times with zucchini 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.289
 made with cheese with pumpkin with cubes 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.969
 cooked pumpkin can be arranged 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.860
 with the vegetable that you want the important thing 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.850
 is that you encourage the barley and make yourself 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.850
 a barley risotto 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.750
 well this one has devastating the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.480
 modules because that thing has the risotto 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.819
 it's theirs weighs said rich says it's 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.010
 forceful and that suits you well there is something 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.010
 that gives it away 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.120
 exactly while taking his side 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 is the onion I'm telling you what 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.680
 what else has has garlic onion butter 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.750
 and olive oil I put just one 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 little bit of salt we are going to put the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.110
 barley cheer up to buy it seriously 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 purchases even if they are medium follow the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.750
 dietetics is economical is said 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.080
 previous treatment wash it because in 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.760
 general has as the poule in to the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.740
 private to remove the husk 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.010
 has as a col vice that is the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.010
 same 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.110
 so just Lausanne from the crude not 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.390
 you have to precook the a 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.460
 directly roughly in half an hour 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.650
 of cooking you will have ready this 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:15.340
 spectacular risotto surrounding a lens 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.560
 attractive and nutritional rendidor 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 I see the colors I'm imagining 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.560
 forever 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.390
 of life spreading health 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.790
 actually spreading health 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 wisdom with very funny way of 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.140
 tell you what you have for today do not tell 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.630
 you can lose because all of us all 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.210
 we need to learn to take care of ourselves in the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.060
 this weekend is a moment of 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.400
 control is a difficult time I do not 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.310
 count how many times I've started with 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.250
 all will and resignation recipes that 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.500
 given my eternal overweight a 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.360
 Monday with all the force and already when 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.360
 come Saturday scatter 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.319
 It is permitted league and media 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.739
 come to help we do not want what I 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.739
 nothing more 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.500
 but one depends on nothing 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.550
 tips to do it right and to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.410
 take care of the weekend he gave here 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:30.610
 I'm going to add the barley 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.990
 raw directly by people and not 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.580
 by people as it does when rice 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.580
 it's going to be a little bit more being a 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.230
 little bit more I saw the barley but the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.910
 truth is that it is very rich and you do not 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.980
 you can lose 80 grams per person going to 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.070
 be good apart is vegetarian is 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.290
 super super livianito I put here 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.500
 then the barley we let them brown 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.570
 30 seconds a minute and I'm going to water 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.060
 something that I really like how they are 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.070
 the risottos that is the white wine well 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.960
 has a little bit of white wine and 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.509
 then he will have broth 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 meanwhile this time that is cooking 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.600
 the risotto he's going to make between 20 and 25 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.090
 minutes 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.949
 we are going to brown the puppies so much 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.720
 the aubergines and all this but now 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.000
 I will take advantage of the moment that is 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.729
 Warm the pan to throw the wine 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.400
 white and that you are absorbing the barley 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.100
 the onion all this nice character 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
 I 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.180
 a third of short ones had nothing I thought 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 that you came with all that face 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.190
 here is a background touch to me I like it 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.050
 quite the touch that the white wine 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.249
 to see you I passed some gold some 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.289
 verbs but 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.629
 Well, the important thing is to let the 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.519
 alcohol so that that taste to raw wine 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.519
 directly but they give it acidity 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.259
 I put a third of a third cup 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:48.589
 of a glass of white wine and what I have 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.589
 over here 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.520
 well fine very well but surely one of 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:58.940
 these families with 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:02.110
 a little broth with this asking for a 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.110
 little bit more like he's doing 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.460
 the time in the barley and the risotto or 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:15.639
 as it is called in this version of risotto 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:15.639
 with a small beach and we go back
