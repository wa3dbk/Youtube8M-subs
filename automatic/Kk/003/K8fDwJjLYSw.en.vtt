these 1 by 2 plates with a stick thing

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.670 
these 1 by 2 plates with a stick thing
attached<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.910> one<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.660> these<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
attached to it and one of these it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.490 
attached to it and one of these it's
more<00:01:11.460> grippy<00:01:11.970> piece<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:13.050> I<00:01:13.110> shaved<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> bit

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
more grippy piece but I shaved off a bit

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.260 
more grippy piece but I shaved off a bit
right<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:17.780> as<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> reason

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right there as you can see the reason

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.910 
right there as you can see the reason
for<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.050> you<00:01:22.140> don't<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.800> won't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
for that is if you don't then it won't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.279 
for that is if you don't then it won't
fit<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:26.330> two<00:01:27.330> revolvers<00:01:29.149> but<00:01:30.149> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.050> not

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
fit right two revolvers but this is not

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.550 
fit right two revolvers but this is not
how<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> revolver<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.399> normally<00:01:32.850> looks<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
how the revolver it normally looks like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.340 
how the revolver it normally looks like
it<00:01:34.560> usually<00:01:34.740> looks<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> shaved

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it usually looks like this but I shaved

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.430 
it usually looks like this but I shaved
off<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.950> barrel<00:01:39.170> should<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.289> that

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
off some of the barrel should do that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.290 
off some of the barrel should do that
with<00:01:40.560> both<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.190> revolvers<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.119> won't

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
with both of the revolvers or it won't

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.650 
with both of the revolvers or it won't
fit<00:01:42.660> into<00:01:42.929> the<00:01:43.170> same<00:01:43.440> piece<00:01:45.590> one<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> these

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
fit into the same piece one of these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.520 
fit into the same piece one of these
studs<00:01:48.920> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.190> hook<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> top

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.690 

a<00:01:54.560> little<00:01:55.430> crest<00:01:55.760> piece<00:01:56.980> it's<00:01:57.980> for<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.490> head

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
a little crest piece it's for the head

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.000 
a little crest piece it's for the head
you<00:01:59.240> can<00:01:59.270> make<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.720> match<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.460> actual<00:02:01.460> antlion

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
you can make it match the actual antlion

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.450 
you can make it match the actual antlion
color<00:02:04.010> I<00:02:04.450> don't<00:02:05.450> because<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:09.160> two<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.340> these

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
color I don't because and two of these

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.230 
color I don't because and two of these
well<00:02:11.090> not<00:02:11.420> two<00:02:11.570> with<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:12.050> more<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:13.240> one

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
well not two with you some more like one

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.340 
well not two with you some more like one
of<00:02:14.360> each<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:16.070> they<00:02:16.220> are<00:02:16.610> opposite<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.570> mine

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
of each so they are opposite and mine

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.000 
of each so they are opposite and mine
are<00:02:18.500> brown<00:02:18.710> because<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.700> couldn't<00:02:20.630> find<00:02:21.010> yellow

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
are brown because I couldn't find yellow

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.460 
are brown because I couldn't find yellow
or<00:02:22.370> even<00:02:22.400> lime-green

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
or even lime-green

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.540 
or even lime-green
that's<00:02:24.470> why<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.920> yellow<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.460> these

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
that's why this is yellow and these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.500 
that's why this is yellow and these
aren't<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:27.380> need<00:02:27.560> two<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:29.740> these<00:02:31.510> little

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
aren't so you need two of these little

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.199 
aren't so you need two of these little
pieces<00:02:32.690> with<00:02:33.080> studs<00:02:33.680> all<00:02:33.980> around<00:02:34.400> except<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
pieces with studs all around except the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.310 
pieces with studs all around except the
bottom<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:37.300> two<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.450> these<00:02:38.540> these<00:02:39.080> aren't

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
bottom and two of these these aren't

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.080 
bottom and two of these these aren't
actual<00:02:39.560> pieces<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.850> are<00:02:41.090> actually<00:02:43.090> from

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
actual pieces they are actually from

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.390 
actual pieces they are actually from
Bionicle<00:02:44.720> sets<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.320> can<00:02:45.470> get<00:02:45.680> these<00:02:46.040> long

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
Bionicle sets you can get these long

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.340 
Bionicle sets you can get these long
bendy<00:02:46.910> pieces<00:02:47.480> they're<00:02:48.410> hollow<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:50.110> mean<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.290> I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
bendy pieces they're hollow I mean so I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.600 
bendy pieces they're hollow I mean so I
don't<00:02:51.560> know<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.890> camera<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.280> good<00:02:52.430> enough

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
don't know if the camera is good enough

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.540 
don't know if the camera is good enough
to<00:02:52.730> show<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:54.140> pretty<00:02:54.740> much<00:02:54.980> they<00:02:55.430> are

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to show that but pretty much they are

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.990 
to show that but pretty much they are
really<00:02:55.850> easy<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> cut<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.890> any<00:02:58.000> basic

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
really easy to cut and any basic

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.580 
really easy to cut and any basic
scissors<00:02:59.420> unless<00:02:59.959> you're<00:03:00.170> using<00:03:00.350> like

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590

preschool scissors or something

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.280 
preschool scissors or something
well<00:03:03.170> cut<00:03:03.560> these<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.690> just<00:03:05.690> need<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.959> cut

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
well cut these so you just need to cut

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.910 
well cut these so you just need to cut
two<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.519> same<00:03:07.760> size<00:03:08.440> liner<00:03:09.440> black<00:03:09.709> to

match the rest but you know whatever

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.259 
match the rest but you know whatever
color<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.500> use<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:13.430> one<00:03:13.580> of<00:03:13.700> these<00:03:13.790> tubes
