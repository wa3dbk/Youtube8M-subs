by<00:01:41.459> adding<00:01:41.849> a<00:01:42.119> studio<00:01:42.899> flash<00:01:43.349> now<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.039> a

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
by adding a studio flash now this is a

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.209 
by adding a studio flash now this is a
pro<00:01:44.429> faux<00:01:44.609> Profoto<00:01:45.270> b2<00:01:46.020> 600<00:01:46.709> watt<00:01:46.859> second

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219

pro faux Profoto b2 600 watt second
flash<00:01:47.429> we're<00:01:47.670> using<00:01:47.819> a<00:01:47.969> magnum<00:01:48.329> reflector<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
flash we're using a magnum reflector and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.240 
flash we're using a magnum reflector and
this<00:01:48.929> is<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> throw<00:01:49.469> out<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> tremendous

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this is going to throw out a tremendous

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.279 
this is going to throw out a tremendous
amount<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.549> light<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.329> 10<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> 15

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
amount of light so at about 10 to 15

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.469 
amount of light so at about 10 to 15
feet<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:52.619> 20<00:01:53.069> feet<00:01:53.219> we<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.369> shoot<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.909> f10

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
feet maybe 20 feet we can shoot at f10

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.260 
feet maybe 20 feet we can shoot at f10
and<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.349> that<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.789> metered

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and we know that because we have metered

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.119 
and we know that because we have metered
that<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.349> that<00:01:58.469> allows<00:01:58.679> us<00:01:58.709> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.039> is

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.129 
that and what that allows us to do is

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.800 
that and what that allows us to do is
underexposed<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.969> ambient<00:02:00.390> light<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
underexposed the ambient light just a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.850 
underexposed the ambient light just a
little<00:02:00.989> bit<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.379> these<00:02:01.530> look<00:02:01.739> a<00:02:01.829> little

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
little bit and make these look a little

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.949 
little bit and make these look a little
bit<00:02:02.159> punchier<00:02:02.789> it's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.239> cool<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
bit punchier it's really cool well the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.440 
bit punchier it's really cool well the
plus<00:02:04.140> X's<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.879> instrumental<00:02:05.879> in<00:02:06.060> making<00:02:06.209> this

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
plus X's are instrumental in making this

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.819 
plus X's are instrumental in making this
work<00:02:06.629> so<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.959> is<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.379> that<00:02:07.500> Kelsey<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
work so this is the one that Kelsey is

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.259 
work so this is the one that Kelsey is
going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> used<00:02:08.220> inside<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.549> car<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
going to be used inside the car to

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.490 
going to be used inside the car to
trigger<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> flash<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.170> haven't<00:02:10.349> changed

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
trigger the flash and we haven't changed

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
trigger the flash and we haven't changed
anything<00:02:10.769> this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.489> channel<00:02:11.790> 1<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.660> on

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
anything this is on channel 1 this is on

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390 
anything this is on channel 1 this is on
channel<00:02:13.140> 1<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.590> she<00:02:13.709> pushes<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
channel 1 so when she pushes this it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.690 
channel 1 so when she pushes this it
makes<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.180> camera<00:02:15.599> fire<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:17.069> what<00:02:17.310> happens

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
makes the camera fire but what happens

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.330 
makes the camera fire but what happens
is<00:02:17.819> auto<00:02:18.120> relay<00:02:18.450> mode<00:02:18.660> kicks<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.950> soon

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is auto relay mode kicks in so as soon

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.300 
is auto relay mode kicks in so as soon
as<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.640> shutter<00:02:21.239> opens<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:23.010> camera

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
as the shutter opens and this camera

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.910 
as the shutter opens and this camera
takes<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.700> picture<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.359> this<00:02:24.840> plus<00:02:25.500> X<00:02:25.769> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
takes a picture then this plus X is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.979 
takes a picture then this plus X is
going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.190> send<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.579> different<00:02:26.819> signal<00:02:27.359> over<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
going to send a different signal over to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.690 
going to send a different signal over to
a<00:02:28.019> plus<00:02:28.739> X<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.069> I've<00:02:29.190> hooked<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.609> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
a plus X that I've hooked up to the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.059 
a plus X that I've hooked up to the
flash<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.329> that's<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.810> channel<00:02:31.200> 2<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
flash and that's on channel 2 and so

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.190 
flash and that's on channel 2 and so
that<00:02:32.250> way<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.670> flash<00:02:33.000> will<00:02:33.359> only<00:02:33.569> fire<00:02:33.900> when

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that way the flash will only fire when

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930 
that way the flash will only fire when
the<00:02:34.290> shutter<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.650> open<00:02:34.859> so<00:02:35.160> everything<00:02:35.639> is<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the shutter is open so everything is in

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.819 
the shutter is open so everything is in
sync<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.079> these<00:02:37.169> all<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> same

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
sync so if I have these all to the same

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.830 
sync so if I have these all to the same
channel<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.669> flash<00:02:38.910> would<00:02:39.120> fire<00:02:39.299> before<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
channel the flash would fire before the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360 
channel the flash would fire before the
shutter<00:02:40.079> was<00:02:40.290> open<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.709> wouldn't<00:02:41.010> work<00:02:41.130> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
shutter was open and it wouldn't work so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.240 
shutter was open and it wouldn't work so
channel<00:02:41.940> 1<00:02:42.209> hits<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.200> channel<00:02:43.530> 1<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
channel 1 hits this on channel 1 the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.460 
channel 1 hits this on channel 1 the
shutter<00:02:44.549> opens<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.389> sends<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.780> new<00:02:45.959> signal<00:02:46.349> on

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
shutter opens it sends a new signal on

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
shutter opens it sends a new signal on
channel<00:02:46.829> 2<00:02:47.040> over<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.940> flash<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.480> flash

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
channel 2 over to the flash the flash

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.059 
channel 2 over to the flash the flash
fires<00:02:49.049> when<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.380> shutter<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.709> open<00:02:49.799> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
fires when the shutter is open and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.680 
fires when the shutter is open and
everything<00:02:50.280> works<00:02:50.639> great<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.480> we're<00:02:51.599> gonna

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
everything works great so we're gonna

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.000 
everything works great so we're gonna
head<00:02:51.870> down<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.169> mountain<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.829> some

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
head down the mountain take some

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.930 
head down the mountain take some
pictures<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.400> we'll<00:02:53.489> show<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.669> how<00:02:53.760> these

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
pictures and we'll show you how these

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:32.140 
pictures and we'll show you how these
look

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
