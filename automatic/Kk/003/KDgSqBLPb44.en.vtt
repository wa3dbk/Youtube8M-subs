00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
Halloween versions so start off with

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.950

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Angry Birds it's nonsense and it's the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
Halloween version and like I said but I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
Halloween version and like I said but I
kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.590> find<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> disappointing<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.820> they

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
kind of find it disappointing that they

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.640 
kind of find it disappointing that they
couldn't<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.330> put<00:00:18.690> an<00:00:18.779> update<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
couldn't have just put an update with it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
couldn't have just put an update with it
instead<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> making<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.910> whole<00:00:21.090> new<00:00:21.270> app<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
instead of making a whole new app for it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
instead of making a whole new app for it
so<00:00:22.590> we'll<00:00:22.890> start<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.369> number<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.880> real

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

shots with your little creatures last
one<00:01:17.990> okay<00:01:18.990> let's<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:20.280> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
one okay let's think so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.560 
one okay let's think so
what's<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.420> level<00:01:21.780> level<00:01:22.710> sales<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
what's that level level sales so it's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
what's that level level sales so it's
very<00:01:24.840> simple<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.100> Halloween

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
very simple and it's just a Halloween

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.670 
very simple and it's just a Halloween
version<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.150> into<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.920> good<00:01:28.920> for

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
version look into it it's good for

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.630 
version look into it it's good for
Halloween<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.799> guess<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> point

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
Halloween I guess that's the point

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240 
Halloween I guess that's the point
anyways<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> next<00:01:33.600> step<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> doodle<00:01:34.470> jump<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
