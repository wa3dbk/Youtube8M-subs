00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.520 
do that first I've done it a different
way<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:46.659> and<00:02:47.659> then<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.959> want<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.200> bring<00:02:48.379> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
way but and then you want to bring the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.740 
way but and then you want to bring the
arms<00:02:48.829> around<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> front<00:02:49.599> so<00:02:50.599> they're

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
arms around to the front so they're

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.740 
arms around to the front so they're
facing<00:02:50.959> forwards<00:02:51.470> then<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.340> rotate<00:02:52.879> this

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
facing forwards then you rotate this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.440 
facing forwards then you rotate this
panel<00:02:54.290> backwards<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.730> so<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> then<00:03:01.639> you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
panel backwards like so and then you

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.610 
panel backwards like so and then you
split<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.530> back<00:03:03.739> pull<00:03:04.220> out<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> weapon<00:03:05.620> and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
split the back pull out the weapon and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.580 
split the back pull out the weapon and
then<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:07.010> fold<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.849> whole<00:03:08.840> leg<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.560> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
then you fold the whole leg like that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.309 
then you fold the whole leg like that
and<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.129> piece<00:03:10.430> lifts<00:03:10.790> up<00:03:11.139> at<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.230> other

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
and this piece lifts up at the other

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.509 
and this piece lifts up at the other
side<00:03:13.810> fold<00:03:14.810> upwards<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.769> lifts<00:03:16.099> up<00:03:16.220> then

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
side fold upwards and this lifts up then

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.970 
side fold upwards and this lifts up then
you<00:03:16.609> want<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.319> want<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.530> move<00:03:18.739> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
you want to then you want to move it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.199 
you want to then you want to move it
away<00:03:19.220> from<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:21.169> like<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.669> hold<00:03:22.879> the

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
away from it like so then you hold the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.780 
away from it like so then you hold the
back<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.109> want<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.840> pull<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.470> foot

down woods actually hold the leg and

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.189 
down woods actually hold the leg and
then<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:34.069> get<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.340> autumn<00:03:34.790> or<00:03:35.199> technology

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199
