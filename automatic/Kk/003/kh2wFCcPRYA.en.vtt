00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 the filling of the wet heirs evaporated 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.480
 with formic acid can be used in the home 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.939
 kitchen or in the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.750
 war clearance is natural 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.550
 while on an appropriate 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.869
 to pay attention to protective clothing 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.340
 that means acid-resistant gloves 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.470
 long-sleeved clothing and goggles 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.939
 for the eyes 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.680
 important is also a water source in 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.510
 to have immediate proximity 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.470
 if any of the formic acid 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.780
 the filling of the is spilled 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.879
 bottle of wet haider is evaporated 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.739
 easiest with a suitable one 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.250
 funnel in order to different 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.250
 avoid 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.190
 the corresponding amount of formic acid 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.220
 is filled in and can be a scaling 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 the bottle to be controlled 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.080
 how much formic acid is needed 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.140
 depends on the people's strength and is 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 refer to the instructions for use 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.160
 after filling the bottle the same 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 leak-proof seal and 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.170
 accidentally set aside 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.250
 in a similar way are now the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.229
 Bottles of the wet heels startled for 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.530
 all bee colonies of the treated 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.110
 bees stand prepared to fill 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.360
 the bottle is made with 60 percent 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.360
 formic acid footbed 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.390
 on the apiary it needs next to the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.229
 basic content equipment 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 additional days ideally a flat 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.840
 But it can also be a consequence 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.210
 a floor slide is on the one hand 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.180
 needed for the possibly open grid 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.310
 cover the floor and of course for 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.200
 the control of the mite infestation during 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.430
 the treatment 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.580
 very important is also the personal 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.709
 Protective clothing and enough water around 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.510
 wash off any spilled acid 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.190
 to be able to 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.709
 belongs to personal protective clothing 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.370
 long-sleeved clothing a safety goggles 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.560
 To protect the eyes and gloves 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.950
 Please wear the gloves on 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.269
 acidity 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 at the beginning of the treatment still 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.590
 cover open grid floor 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.769
 or the floor insert for 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.570
 insert varroa control 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.440
 eventual constricting flight hole parts 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.750
 remove 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.750
 the flight hole should be at the ars 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.630
 be wide open treatment 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.769
 the wet-hearted will evaporate now 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.079
 composite 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.019
 this is the wick with the holder there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.810
 to the acid tank mount the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.209
 put on the rear stand and that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.140
 whole on the non-woven cloth in the tub 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.780
 put on 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.510
 There are different sizes udo eight 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.370
 Depending on the people's strength, the right thing 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.060
 Size is the instructions for use too 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.810
 remove 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.120
 the wick absorbs the formic acid and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.209
 whether she's on the flowing towel where she 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.579
 the so prepared prepares to evaporate 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.350
 Wet heath will now evaporate into the 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.260
 bee colony used 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.239
 For this purpose, the people will open the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 plastic film far away and the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.090
 bees with a smoke bump down 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.090
 driven 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.460
 existing wax superstructure is from the 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.820
 upper girders removed around a straight 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.740
 to set up the merit 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.400
 the prepared verdunste is on the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.310
 upper carrier and the apprenticeship 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.050
 put on the verdunste remains during 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.710
 the minimum treatment duration of ten 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.480
 until 14 days in the bee colony after two 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.300
 days the evaporation amount 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.640
 control the specialist center bees 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.640
 wishes a lot of success in the treatment
