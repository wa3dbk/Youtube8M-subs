00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 I am her 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 difficult 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.239
 released 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 myself 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300
 fair 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.140
 I personally 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 to save 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.850
 Yasha is better than less 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670
 on 6 0 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 further 0 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.300
 this measure 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.460
 and significantly 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.750
 I 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.190
 me not 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 0102 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.059

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.410
 to help him 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.649
 In my opinion 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.649
 following 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 in Tyumen 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.039
