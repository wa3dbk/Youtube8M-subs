00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
it's an interesting thought the I think

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.389 
it's an interesting thought the I think
that<00:00:04.790> there's<00:00:05.000> a<00:00:05.060> lot<00:00:05.269> of<00:00:06.040> schools<00:00:07.040> of<00:00:07.189> thought

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
that there's a lot of schools of thought

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.700 
that there's a lot of schools of thought
that<00:00:07.639> imply<00:00:08.000> or<00:00:08.599> that<00:00:08.750> indicate<00:00:09.170> that<00:00:09.349> if<00:00:09.500> you

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
that imply or that indicate that if you

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.830 
that imply or that indicate that if you
if<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.280> take<00:00:10.460> your<00:00:10.640> premium<00:00:11.060> inventory<00:00:11.210> and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
if you take your premium inventory and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.320 
if you take your premium inventory and
you<00:00:11.960> put<00:00:12.200> it<00:00:12.320> on<00:00:12.890> an<00:00:12.980> exchange<00:00:13.430> or<00:00:13.610> in<00:00:13.760> an<00:00:13.880> RTB

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
you put it on an exchange or in an RTB

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.210 
you put it on an exchange or in an RTB
that<00:00:15.290> you<00:00:15.440> will<00:00:15.590> quickly<00:00:15.889> lose<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:18.560> value<00:00:19.130> of

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
that you will quickly lose the value of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.070 
that you will quickly lose the value of
that<00:00:19.340> inventory<00:00:19.550> will<00:00:19.820> quickly<00:00:20.360> diminish<00:00:20.600> and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
that inventory will quickly diminish and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.830 
that inventory will quickly diminish and
I<00:00:22.039> think<00:00:22.730> what<00:00:22.910> I<00:00:22.940> hear<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.240> describing<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
I think what I hear you describing is a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.120 
I think what I hear you describing is a
situation<00:00:24.080> where<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:24.500> can<00:00:24.650> say<00:00:24.770> no<00:00:24.949> this

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
situation where you can say no this

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.790 
situation where you can say no this
inventory<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:26.029> not<00:00:26.510> like<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.320> rest<00:00:27.529> of<00:00:27.650> it

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
inventory is not like the rest of it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.359 
inventory is not like the rest of it
this<00:00:28.760> is<00:00:28.820> special<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:29.539> still<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.170> still<00:00:30.470> has<00:00:31.340> a

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
this is special it still it still has a

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.450 
this is special it still it still has a
high<00:00:31.580> value<00:00:31.609> and<00:00:32.539> I<00:00:32.599> still<00:00:32.809> have<00:00:32.899> to<00:00:33.019> be<00:00:33.109> paid

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
high value and I still have to be paid

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.380 
high value and I still have to be paid
more<00:00:34.460> for<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.850> is<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:35.120> what<00:00:35.239> you're

of stuff coming across we have no way to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.590 
of stuff coming across we have no way to
know<00:01:12.049> if<00:01:12.469> it's<00:01:13.159> premium<00:01:13.429> premium<00:01:13.909> or<00:01:14.179> not<00:01:14.329> and

know if it's premium premium or not and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.719 
know if it's premium premium or not and
if<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:14.899> didn't<00:01:15.350> know<00:01:15.499> that<00:01:15.529> premium<00:01:16.159> was<00:01:16.429> there

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
if we didn't know that premium was there

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.149 
if we didn't know that premium was there
we<00:01:17.060> would<00:01:17.240> market<00:01:17.569> it<00:01:17.689> differently<00:01:18.109> and<00:01:18.649> sell

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
we would market it differently and sell

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.190 
we would market it differently and sell
it<00:01:19.279> differently<00:01:19.609> and<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.299> make<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.020> appear

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
it differently and and make it appear

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.980 
it differently and and make it appear
different<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.859> our<00:01:21.979> buying<00:01:22.459> tools<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.569> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
different in our buying tools so so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.230 
different in our buying tools so so
that's<00:01:24.139> our<00:01:24.259> definitely<00:01:24.799> true<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.819> think

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
that's our definitely true and I think

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.300 
that's our definitely true and I think
you<00:01:26.450> know<00:01:26.539> there's<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.779> lot<00:01:26.929> of<00:01:27.079> anxiety<00:01:27.799> about

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you know there's a lot of anxiety about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.589 
you know there's a lot of anxiety about
programmatic<00:01:28.939> buying<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.359> what<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:29.569> going

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
programmatic buying and what it's going

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.539 
programmatic buying and what it's going
to<00:01:29.749> do<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:29.959> the<00:01:30.170> industry<00:01:30.679> but<00:01:30.889> the<00:01:31.189> fact<00:01:31.399> is

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
to do to the industry but the fact is

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.389 
to do to the industry but the fact is
the<00:01:31.729> numbers<00:01:32.060> show<00:01:32.749> that<00:01:32.779> the<00:01:33.380> digital<00:01:34.130> ad

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
the numbers show that the digital ad

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.190 
the numbers show that the digital ad
buying<00:01:34.609> is<00:01:34.819> just<00:01:35.060> too<00:01:35.479> hard<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.139> too

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
buying is just too hard and too

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.469 
buying is just too hard and too
expensive<00:01:36.679> we<00:01:37.549> have<00:01:37.669> to<00:01:37.789> find<00:01:37.969> ways<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.179> make

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
expensive we have to find ways to make

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.319 
expensive we have to find ways to make
it<00:01:38.599> simpler<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.889> know<00:01:40.039> RTB<00:01:40.639> is<00:01:40.880> one<00:01:41.179> of

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
it simpler and you know RTB is one of

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.319 
it simpler and you know RTB is one of
those<00:01:41.450> ways<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.979> inventory<00:01:43.579> registration<00:01:44.209> in

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
those ways in inventory registration in

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.999 
those ways in inventory registration in
a<00:01:44.419> standardized<00:01:44.989> format<00:01:45.109> that's<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.770> same

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
a standardized format that's the same

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.080 
a standardized format that's the same
like<00:01:46.369> if<00:01:46.459> you<00:01:46.549> don't<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.969> work<00:01:47.060> with

what happens today in terms of just

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.310 
what happens today in terms of just
using<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.060> DSP<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:33.020> through<00:02:33.230> an

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
using a DSP and going through an

what open RTV is going to produce sure

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.990 
what open RTV is going to produce sure
so<00:02:44.020> historically<00:02:45.020> when<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.350> bought<00:02:45.530> media<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
so historically when you bought media it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.310 
so historically when you bought media it
was<00:02:47.090> done<00:02:47.270> over<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> telephone<00:02:47.570> most<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
was done over the telephone most of the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.440 
was done over the telephone most of the
time<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:49.400> any<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:49.910> been<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.300> there
