so this piece is gonna have B flats to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.830 
so this piece is gonna have B flats to
it<00:01:05.310> it<00:01:06.310> does<00:01:06.490> happen<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:06.940> both<00:01:07.030> hands<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.570> good

luck<00:01:07.960> where<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:08.979> take<00:01:09.100> these<00:01:09.220> four<00:01:09.460> bars<00:01:09.610> at<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
luck where you take these four bars at a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.640 
luck where you take these four bars at a
time<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.390> first<00:01:10.420> four<00:01:10.810> bars<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.470> our

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
time so the first four bars is our

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.860 
time so the first four bars is our
maintained

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.219 

yeah

yeah

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.249 
yeah
so<00:01:20.219> what<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.000> should<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.509> first<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> try

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so what you should do is first to try

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
so what you should do is first to try
that<00:01:22.380> left<00:01:22.619> hands<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.250> should<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> same<00:01:23.820> as

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that left hands it should be the same as

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
that left hands it should be the same as
your<00:01:24.180> key<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.899> form<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.030> once<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
your key of that form up and once you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.490 
your key of that form up and once you
get<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.270> left<00:01:27.509> hands<00:01:27.719> just<00:01:28.079> try<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.289> right

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
get your left hands just try the right

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.399 
get your left hands just try the right
hand<00:01:28.740> by<00:01:28.829> itself

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.859 

yeah<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.969> new<00:01:38.090> way<00:01:38.240> we've<00:01:38.450> been<00:01:38.570> talking

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
yeah the new way we've been talking

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.510 
yeah the new way we've been talking
about<00:01:38.899> practicing<00:01:39.619> I'll<00:01:39.920> give<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.399> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
about practicing I'll give you that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.560 
about practicing I'll give you that
paper<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.240> practice<00:01:41.659> is<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.640> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
paper and the practice is the is to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.060 
paper and the practice is the is to
practice<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.110> phrase<00:01:45.320> over<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.680> over<00:01:45.829> until

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
practice the phrase over and over until

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.679 
practice the phrase over and over until
you<00:01:46.250> almost<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> mime<00:01:46.970> artist<00:01:47.270> until<00:01:47.539> it's

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
you almost have a mime artist until it's

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.260 
you almost have a mime artist until it's
easy<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.890> should<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:51.729> look<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.149> you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
easy so you should be you look and you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.919 
easy so you should be you look and you
stick<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.659> really<00:01:53.869> play<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:57.380> again<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.750> then

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
stick it really play and again and then

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.249 
stick it really play and again and then
when<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.229> go<00:02:00.350> outside<00:02:00.799> by<00:02:01.130> sale<00:02:01.960> thank<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
when you go outside by sale thank you to

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.960 
when you go outside by sale thank you to
both<00:02:03.380> hands<00:02:03.679> every<00:02:04.009> day<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:07.460> second<00:02:07.789> phrase

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
both hands every day the second phrase

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.420 
both hands every day the second phrase
is<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.269> same<00:02:08.479> thing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.160 

so<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.489> practice<00:02:17.939> measure<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.450> through<00:02:18.720> four

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
so in practice measure one through four

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.869 
so in practice measure one through four
a<00:02:19.620> lot<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:20.819> you'll<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.420> 5<00:02:21.720> 3<00:02:22.400> MN<00:02:23.400> 9<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.849> a

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
a lot and then you'll get 5 3 MN 9 is a

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.819 
a lot and then you'll get 5 3 MN 9 is a
little<00:02:24.209> beat<00:02:24.329> section<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.409> these<00:02:25.560> four

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
little beat section we have these four

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.319 
little beat section we have these four
measures<00:02:26.189> a<00:02:26.220> little<00:02:26.519> bit<00:02:26.610> different<00:02:26.909> but

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
measures a little bit different but

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.360 
measures a little bit different but
these<00:02:27.510> two<00:02:27.780> bars<00:02:28.049> are<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.650> similar<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
these two bars are really similar to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
these two bars are really similar to
those<00:02:29.519> two<00:02:29.760> bars<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.599> number<00:02:30.870> nine<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.290> ten

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
those two bars so number nine and ten

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.759 
those two bars so number nine and ten
practice<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.940> those<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:36.500> probably<00:02:37.500> should<00:02:37.739> be

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
practice just those I probably should be

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.369 
practice just those I probably should be
able<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.099> both<00:02:38.250> hands<00:02:38.489> at<00:02:38.640> once<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
able to get both hands at once do that

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.830 
able to get both hands at once do that
over<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.709> over<00:02:43.769> until<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.310> easy<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.840> then

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
over and over until it's easy and then

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
over and over until it's easy and then
try<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.079> next<00:02:46.349> two<00:02:46.470> bars<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:47.069> it's<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
try the next two bars because it's the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.180 
try the next two bars because it's the
same<00:02:47.640> idea<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:51.440> transpose<00:02:52.440> down<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.069> you're

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
same idea just transpose down so you're

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.360 
same idea just transpose down so you're
going<00:02:53.430> down<00:02:53.700> sneaky<00:02:53.970> same<00:02:54.959> same<00:02:55.500> idea<00:02:55.859> did<00:02:56.340> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
going down sneaky same same idea did you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.089 
going down sneaky same same idea did you
play<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.760> same<00:02:56.909> thing<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.389> different<00:02:57.900> keys

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
play the same thing and different keys

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.369 
play the same thing and different keys
okay<00:02:59.180> then<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> end<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> song<00:03:01.109> we<00:03:01.290> do

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
okay then for the end of the song we do

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.629 
okay then for the end of the song we do
the<00:03:01.500> same<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.889> beginning<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.489> if<00:03:02.549> you

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
the same as the beginning so if you

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.430 
the same as the beginning so if you
practice<00:03:03.000> your<00:03:03.150> beginning<00:03:03.420> 40,000<00:03:04.290> times

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
practice your beginning 40,000 times

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.580 
practice your beginning 40,000 times
like<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.280> did

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:28.830 

the<00:03:12.590> last<00:03:12.830> line<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> little<00:03:13.760> new<00:03:13.880> part

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.270 

remember<00:03:29.890> yes<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.620> b-flat<00:03:34.069> and
