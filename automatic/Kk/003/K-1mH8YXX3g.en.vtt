00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.734
Rachel and I really like to
use these little wheelie desks,

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.501
on the day bed
with the computers.

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:06.868
And I'd like to make some
drawers to go underneath them.

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:08.901
And I even made
a drawer like that before,

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:11.334
but the problem with these
desks is they go underneath

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.701
the bed, so I need a drawer
that doesn't touch the floor.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.435
As usual,
I'm starting this project

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.500
with some used lumber
I picked up from the garbage.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.735
And here I'm cutting that into
strips to use for my drawers.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
I glued some of the scraps
side by side

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:29.268
to get enough width
for the drawers.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.133
It seems to be fashionable
to take new wood,

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:33.834
and make it look
old and banged up.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.168
But I like to
go against fashions,

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.334
so I taking my old wood
and planing it down a bit,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.034
to make it look newer.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.266
And, as usual,
I'm joining the corners with

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.367
my screw advance box joint jig.

00:00:44.434 --> 00:00:47.235
I usually run it
without a table saw insert,

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.334
so that I suck a little bit
more dust down the saw,

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.734
And I'm making 1/4 inch joints,

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:53.635
and I'm just using
a regular table saw blade

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.635
by making multiple cuts.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.168
The pieces of tape on the gear,
tell me where I need to stop,

00:00:58.234 --> 00:00:59.634
to make the cuts.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.268
So, here's the sides and back
of my big drawer.

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:04.667
And the front needs
to go on to form

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.402
a bit of a T-joint, like this.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.736
So, I could cut a series
of mortises for this joint,

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:12.535
but what I'm doing instead,
is I cut a really deep

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.634
set of box joints on here.

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.734
Now, that leaves a
whole lot of gaps here

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.101
but this was actually
my sacrificial backup

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.734
for cutting these joints,
and I just need to

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.467
stick that in here,

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.467
and that will fill all the gaps.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.201
Before I put it together, I need
to put a rabbet

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.068
in the bottom of the front.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.467
This groove will
allow me to attach

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.501
the bottom of the drawer, later.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.434
Now I just got to put glue
between all the fingers,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.435
and I can assemble
those front joints.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.435
Getting the clamping square,
helps to keep it all square

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:56.101
while I work on
the rest of that drawer.

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:08.134
An extra comb piece

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.234
glued into the end of
that joint, fills it in.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.034
Most of that comb gets cut off
on the table saw.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.434
It's just more convenient to
glue it into the comb,

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.368
instead of individual pieces.

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:27.368
Now I'm ripping some
Mahogany veneer

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800
to go on the front.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.335
I like to do that on the
table saw,

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.601
instead of the band saw if I
can reach across it

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.569
from both sides,
using a 7 1/4 inch blade,

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:37.302
because it makes
a very thin curve

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.835
and the cut is smooth
and precise enough that I don't

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.068
have to do that much to it
to get to the final surface.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:45.134
Now the Mahogany that I had
wasn't quite wide enough

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.200
so I have to join 2 pieces
edge to edge

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.834
to make a full width
veneer for the drawer.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.068
I'm using my long-reach C-clamps
to make sure that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.001
the layers stay
lined up in the middle.

00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:04.569
I'm using a scrap of wood
to spread

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.368
the glue on the front
and on the veneer.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.767
That way I don't have a glue
roller or glue brush

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.735
that I need to worry
about cleaning afterwards.

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.368
I'm using a scrap of carpeting

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400
to spread the clamping force
all over the front,

00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:21.868
and then a board on top of that
and then lots and lots of clamps

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:26.601
After applying all the clamps, I
go through all of them

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.101
and tighten them
a little bit more.

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:31.235
I used a hand plane to flush
trim the veneer to the drawer.

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:34.001
I could have use a machine for
but it wasn't worth setting up.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.234
And then I use
my reverse scoring trick,

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:38.101
to cut off the ends
of the veneer.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.200
Without getting any
chip-out on the front.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.334
I made 2 drawers
80 by 85 centimeters

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.500
but the plywood comes in
150 by 150 centimeter sheets,

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:50.168
and there's now way to
get 2 of those out of that

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.801
without overlapping a bit,

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.335
so I decided to just have the
corner missing from one of them.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.901
I used a 45 degree cut

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:58.835
for gluing in the piece
that was missing.

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.701
I figured that way I get
a slightly stronger glue joint.

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:09.968
And now I'm ready
to glue the bottom on.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The glue is what
mostly holds it on,

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:14.501
but I'm also putting in
a row of brad nails

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:16.701
just to be on the safe side
and also to hold it together

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:18.202
while the glue dries.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.634
I made some brackets to hold
the drawer slides

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:26.334
and those clamp
to the angle iron

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:28.034
that the slats actually rest on.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.233
So that way I can
easily slide them in place.

00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.801
Pushing these drawer slides
closed for the first time

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.635
is always a bit of a challenge.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.534
Now I just need to put the
slats and the mattress back

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:55.234
in place and it's almost done.

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.834
My initial plan was to just
open the drawers

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.802
by reaching underneath them
but then

00:05:08.868 --> 00:05:11.235
a few days later I ended up
putting drawer handles on there.

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:14.101
But the cool thing is,
the drawers aren't completely

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.567
full of junk yet,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.740
it's like they're still
virgin storage space.
