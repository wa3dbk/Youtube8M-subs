so<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.709> friction<00:00:02.280> test<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:03.419> see<00:00:03.830> the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
so this is a friction test to see the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.540 
so this is a friction test to see the
friction<00:00:05.130> between<00:00:05.160> our<00:00:05.490> race<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.000> our

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
friction between our race and our

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.410 
friction between our race and our
spanner<00:00:08.550> nut<00:00:08.670> or<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.450> lock<00:00:09.719> cap<00:00:11.269> we're<00:00:12.269> just

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
spanner nut or our lock cap we're just

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.820 
spanner nut or our lock cap we're just
trying<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.750> see<00:00:12.900> how<00:00:14.480> heats<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.809> force<00:00:16.139> will

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
trying to see how heats and force will

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.060 
trying to see how heats and force will
turn<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> cap<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
turn the cap so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.839 
turn the cap so
we're<00:00:19.460> going<00:00:19.579> to<00:00:19.669> start<00:00:20.119> it<00:00:20.380> 125<00:00:21.380> rpm<00:00:21.849> your

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
we're going to start it 125 rpm your

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.190 
we're going to start it 125 rpm your

joint

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.209 

we've<00:00:33.570> done<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:33.990> FK<00:00:34.890> joints<00:00:35.340> with

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
we've done this with FK joints with

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.750 
we've done this with FK joints with
thirty<00:00:38.059> minutes

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.520 

we<00:00:41.030> put<00:00:41.210> some<00:00:41.360> grease<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:41.780> there<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.110> stop<00:00:42.320> us

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
we put some grease in there to stop us

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.950 
we put some grease in there to stop us
from

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.869 

going

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:06.280 

bring<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.210> camera<00:00:52.390> down<00:00:52.629> here

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.310 

so<00:01:06.500> I'm<00:01:06.560> start<00:01:06.830> adding<00:01:07.040> pressure<00:01:07.220> to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
so I'm start adding pressure to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
so I'm start adding pressure to
yes<00:01:08.620> he<00:01:08.800> does<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.160> line

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:02:02.469

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:23.740 

and<00:02:02.840> keep<00:02:02.990> adding<00:02:03.320> virtue

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 

doesn't<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.590> much<00:02:24.710> heat<00:02:24.980> buildup

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
doesn't have as much heat buildup

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:50.410 
doesn't have as much heat buildup
because<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> winds<00:02:26.060> backing<00:02:26.450> out<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.600> racism

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:21.540 

it's<00:05:11.470> actually<00:05:11.740> still<00:05:11.890> tape

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.580

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.740 

or<00:05:50.420> just<00:05:50.600> it<00:05:50.750> up<00:05:50.870> your<00:05:51.080> hand

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.170 

no<00:05:55.260> epidural<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:57.000> that

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
no epidural is not so that

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.100 
no epidural is not so that
okay<00:05:58.780> game<00:05:59.290> feeling

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
okay game feeling

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.530 
okay game feeling
it<00:06:01.560> rotates<00:06:01.920> nice<00:06:02.100> yeah

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
it rotates nice yeah

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.490 
it rotates nice yeah
okay<00:06:04.170> before<00:06:05.070> our<00:06:06.560> new<00:06:07.560> pins<00:06:07.890> and<00:06:08.160> races<00:06:09.500> it

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
okay before our new pins and races it

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.290 
okay before our new pins and races it
would<00:06:10.680> back<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.130> cap<00:06:11.340> right<00:06:11.580> out<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.030> it<00:06:12.150> sort

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
would back the cap right out and it sort

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.970 
would back the cap right out and it sort
of<00:06:13.970> yeah<00:06:14.970> we've<00:06:15.840> been<00:06:15.990> all<00:06:16.080> bad<00:06:16.230> we<00:06:16.620> lost<00:06:16.650> the

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
of yeah we've been all bad we lost the

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.280 
of yeah we've been all bad we lost the
cap<00:06:17.190> it<00:06:17.430> would<00:06:17.550> have<00:06:17.670> wore<00:06:18.390> the<00:06:18.540> races<00:06:18.870> out<00:06:19.020> it

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
cap it would have wore the races out it

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.210 
cap it would have wore the races out it
would<00:06:19.410> have<00:06:19.500> called<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.980> ball<00:06:21.950> that<00:06:22.950> we<00:06:23.040> used

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
would have called the ball that we used

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.140 
would have called the ball that we used
to<00:06:23.370> use<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.550> ballistics<00:06:24.480> later<00:06:24.690> copied<00:06:25.020> us

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
to use the ballistics later copied us

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.550 
to use the ballistics later copied us
able<00:06:27.150> to<00:06:27.210> just<00:06:27.360> melt<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:27.810> because<00:06:28.050> it's<00:06:30.560> this

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
able to just melt it because it's this

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.980 
able to just melt it because it's this
is<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:33.570> wear<00:06:33.780> that<00:06:33.810> we<00:06:34.020> get<00:06:34.140> out<00:06:34.260> of<00:06:34.350> our<00:06:34.470> moles

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
is the wear that we get out of our moles

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.210 
is the wear that we get out of our moles
the<00:06:36.990> last<00:06:37.200> one<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.470> set<00:06:37.680> on<00:06:37.770> fire

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
the last one that set on fire

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.120 
the last one that set on fire
it's<00:06:38.820> just<00:06:39.030> coating<00:06:39.960> coming<00:06:40.230> off<00:06:40.350> the<00:06:40.950> balls

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
it's just coating coming off the balls

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.570 
it's just coating coming off the balls
were<00:06:41.340> not<00:06:41.520> worn

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
were not worn

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.210 
were not worn
raise<00:06:43.180> a<00:06:43.419> snowball<00:06:43.870> again

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.610 

it's<00:06:47.520> covered<00:06:47.880> in<00:06:48.050> grease

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.930 

it's<00:06:52.330> still<00:06:53.330> good<00:06:53.480> for<00:06:53.660> service

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940
