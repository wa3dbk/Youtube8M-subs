00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the dryland practice of abuse we have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.330 
the dryland practice of abuse we have
our<00:02:15.320> paddle<00:02:15.820> underneath<00:02:17.350> our<00:02:18.350> sail<00:02:18.710> sheets<00:02:19.690> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
our paddle underneath our sail sheets so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.900 
our paddle underneath our sail sheets so
we<00:02:22.340> now<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.940> our<00:02:23.240> pull<00:02:23.870> cord<00:02:24.370> nice<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.640> tight

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
we now have our pull cord nice and tight

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.300 
we now have our pull cord nice and tight
so<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.900> bottom<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.440> sail<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:28.010> move

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
so that the bottom of the sail can move

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.480 
so that the bottom of the sail can move
around<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.910> deck<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.390> kayak<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.490> in

around on the deck of the kayak and in

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.230 
around on the deck of the kayak and in
this<00:02:31.700> position<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.810> can<00:02:32.959> downward<00:02:33.650> sail<00:02:34.240> and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
this position we can downward sail and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.570 
this position we can downward sail and
without<00:02:35.540> making<00:02:35.930> any<00:02:36.410> adjustment<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.160> walk<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
without making any adjustment to walk so

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.780 
without making any adjustment to walk so
ever<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> pull<00:02:39.260> cord<00:02:39.530> or<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.040> trim<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.550> the

ever to the pull cord or the trim of the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.510 
ever to the pull cord or the trim of the
sail<00:02:41.380> can<00:02:42.380> actually<00:02:43.570> sail<00:02:44.570> up<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.680> 45<00:02:46.489> degree

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
sail can actually sail up to a 45 degree

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.790 
sail can actually sail up to a 45 degree
angle<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.040> kayak<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.810> use<00:02:51.560> my

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
angle to the back of the kayak so use my

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.940 
angle to the back of the kayak so use my
paddle<00:02:52.220> we<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.090> steer<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:53.950> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
paddle we can steer to the right to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.070 
paddle we can steer to the right to
allow<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.190> wind<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.670> come<00:02:55.880> at<00:02:56.060> 45<00:02:56.630> degrees

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
allow the wind to come at 45 degrees

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.240 
allow the wind to come at 45 degrees
behind<00:02:57.530> me<00:02:57.650> here<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.180> steer<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.660> left

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
behind me here we can steer to the left

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.370 
behind me here we can steer to the left
allowing<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.340> wind<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.910> come<00:03:02.090> at<00:03:02.239> 45<00:03:02.840> degrees

allowing the wind to come at 45 degrees

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
allowing the wind to come at 45 degrees
to<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.800> other<00:03:04.010> side<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> 90<00:03:06.290> degree

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to the other side so we have a 90 degree

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.850 
to the other side so we have a 90 degree
paddling<00:03:07.880> window<00:03:08.360> without<00:03:09.110> making<00:03:09.620> any

paddling window without making any
adjustments<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.610> our<00:03:10.640> sail<00:03:11.769> if<00:03:12.769> we<00:03:13.220> move<00:03:13.430> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
adjustments to our sail if we move a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.880 
adjustments to our sail if we move a
little<00:03:14.150> bit<00:03:14.330> more<00:03:14.390> than<00:03:14.840> 45<00:03:15.320> degrees<00:03:15.650> up<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
little bit more than 45 degrees up to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.170 
little bit more than 45 degrees up to
about<00:03:16.100> 50<00:03:16.519> degrees<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.780> might<00:03:18.049> notice<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
about 50 degrees we might notice that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.750 
about 50 degrees we might notice that
the<00:03:20.180> sale<00:03:20.480> starts<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.410> collapse<00:03:21.769> on<00:03:22.549> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
the sale starts to collapse on the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.270 
the sale starts to collapse on the
windward<00:03:23.239> side<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.530> could<00:03:24.680> collapse<00:03:24.980> down

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
windward side and it could collapse down

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.789 
windward side and it could collapse down
here<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.110> if<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.290> notice<00:03:27.650> that

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
here like this if you notice that

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.640 
here like this if you notice that
happening<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:29.030> take<00:03:29.299> your<00:03:29.510> paddle<00:03:29.900> you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
happening you can take your paddle you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.220 
happening you can take your paddle you
can<00:03:30.799> stop<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.280> sail<00:03:31.519> collapsing<00:03:32.209> by<00:03:32.690> placing

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
can stop the sail collapsing by placing

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.039 
can stop the sail collapsing by placing
the<00:03:33.440> back<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.980> blade<00:03:34.190> on<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.750> windward

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
the back of the blade on the windward

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.759 
the back of the blade on the windward
edge<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.239> paddle<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.260> will<00:03:39.410> stop

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
edge of the paddle and that will stop

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.090 
edge of the paddle and that will stop
collapse<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.600> can<00:03:41.780> then<00:03:41.930> take<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.560> blade<00:03:42.799> on

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
collapse you can then take the blade on

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.069 
collapse you can then take the blade on
the<00:03:43.400> leeward<00:03:43.670> side<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> car<00:03:44.660> away<00:03:45.049> from

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
the leeward side of the car away from

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.039 
the leeward side of the car away from
the<00:03:45.320> wind<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.070> at<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.519> same<00:03:46.760> time<00:03:47.090> use<00:03:47.810> that

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
the wind and at the same time use that

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.060 
the wind and at the same time use that
to<00:03:48.200> steer<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.769> kayak<00:03:49.130> back<00:03:50.060> downwind<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.920> the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
to steer the kayak back downwind so the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.430 
to steer the kayak back downwind so the
sand<00:03:52.370> will<00:03:52.549> fill<00:03:52.790> again<00:03:53.170> alternatively<00:03:54.170> you

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
sand will fill again alternatively you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.449 
sand will fill again alternatively you
can<00:03:54.560> do<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> same<00:03:55.040> on<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.280> other<00:03:55.310> side<00:03:57.459> side

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
can do the same on the other side side

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.240 
can do the same on the other side side
is<00:03:58.730> going<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.030> collapse<00:03:59.329> you<00:04:00.260> can<00:04:00.440> use<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
is going to collapse you can use the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.970 
is going to collapse you can use the
left<00:04:01.489> blade<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:02.090> stop<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.630> collapse<00:04:02.900> use<00:04:03.799> the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
left blade to stop the collapse use the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.789 
left blade to stop the collapse use the
right<00:04:04.250> blade<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:05.239> steer<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.690> car<00:04:05.900> back<00:04:06.530> down

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
right blade to steer the car back down

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.319 
right blade to steer the car back down
wind<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.540> wind<00:04:08.750> paddle<00:04:09.230> feels<00:04:09.470> again<00:04:10.329> okay

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
wind so the wind paddle feels again okay

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.310 
wind so the wind paddle feels again okay
so<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.600> don't<00:04:11.810> need<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.049> make<00:04:12.170> any

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
so you don't need to make any

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.750 
so you don't need to make any
adjustments<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.829> your<00:04:12.950> sail<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.489> you're<00:04:13.640> going

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
adjustments to your sail if you're going

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.699 
adjustments to your sail if you're going
to<00:04:13.849> sell<00:04:14.060> within<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.540> 90<00:04:15.020> degree<00:04:15.140> window

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
to sell within that 90 degree window

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:16.789 
to sell within that 90 degree window
okay

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
okay

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.979 
okay
if<00:04:17.190> you're<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> move<00:04:17.789> beyond<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.599> 90

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
if you're going to move beyond the 90

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.319 
if you're going to move beyond the 90
degree<00:04:19.079> window<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.669> actually<00:04:20.819> want<00:04:21.060> to

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
degree window and you actually want to

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.589 
degree window and you actually want to
move<00:04:21.710> so<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.009> wind<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.490> coming<00:04:23.639> right

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
move so that the wind is coming right

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.899 
move so that the wind is coming right
across<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.199> side<00:04:25.409> of<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.620> kayak<00:04:26.039> you're

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
across the side of the kayak you're

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:49.010 
across the side of the kayak you're
going<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.449> need<00:04:27.629> to<00:04:39.169> use<00:04:40.169> your<00:04:40.349> right<00:04:40.560> hand<00:04:48.020> if

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
going to need to use your right hand if

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.580 
going to need to use your right hand if
you're<00:04:49.409> gonna<00:04:49.620> do<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.099> 90<00:04:51.000> degree<00:04:51.330> reach<00:04:51.599> once

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
you're gonna do a 90 degree reach once

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:01.939 
you're gonna do a 90 degree reach once
you've<00:04:52.800> done<00:04:52.979> that<00:05:00.229> so<00:05:01.229> if<00:05:01.380> we've<00:05:01.590> got<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
you've done that so if we've got the

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.980 
you've done that so if we've got the
wind<00:05:02.130> coming<00:05:02.430> at<00:05:02.580> 90<00:05:03.030> degrees<00:05:03.389> to<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.659> side<00:05:03.810> of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
wind coming at 90 degrees to the side of

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.990 
wind coming at 90 degrees to the side of
the<00:05:04.050> kayak<00:05:04.349> here<00:05:04.620> we're<00:05:05.370> gonna<00:05:05.460> need<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.789> move

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
the kayak here we're gonna need to move

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.610 
the kayak here we're gonna need to move
the<00:05:06.210> sail<00:05:06.449> across<00:05:08.719> like<00:05:09.719> this<00:05:09.960> onto<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the sail across like this onto the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.790 
the sail across like this onto the
leeward<00:05:11.099> side<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.610> kayak<00:05:12.060> okay<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.680> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
leeward side of the kayak okay so the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.980 
leeward side of the kayak okay so the
wind<00:05:14.039> is<00:05:14.159> gonna<00:05:14.280> be<00:05:14.490> coming<00:05:14.759> from<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:15.750> right

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
wind is gonna be coming from the right

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.610 
wind is gonna be coming from the right
here<00:05:16.430> filling<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.550> sail<00:05:17.819> and<00:05:18.810> our<00:05:19.050> carrier<00:05:19.409> is

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
here filling the sail and our carrier is

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.379 
here filling the sail and our carrier is
gonna<00:05:19.740> be<00:05:19.860> traveling<00:05:20.310> at<00:05:20.400> 90<00:05:20.819> degrees<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
gonna be traveling at 90 degrees to the

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.159 
gonna be traveling at 90 degrees to the
wind<00:05:21.599> if<00:05:22.590> we<00:05:22.830> don't<00:05:23.069> have<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> rudder<00:05:23.669> system<00:05:24.169> we

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
wind if we don't have a rudder system we

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.680 
wind if we don't have a rudder system we
can<00:05:25.349> keep<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.710> kayak<00:05:26.000> steering<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.090> 90<00:05:27.360> degrees

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
can keep the kayak steering a 90 degrees

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.870 
can keep the kayak steering a 90 degrees
to<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> wind<00:05:28.139> without<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.159> whether<00:05:29.400> caulking

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
to the wind without it whether caulking

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.600 
to the wind without it whether caulking
into<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> wind<00:05:30.419> if<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.590> do<00:05:31.770> not<00:05:32.009> have<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.340> rotor

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
into the wind if you do not have a rotor

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.070 
into the wind if you do not have a rotor
system<00:05:32.729> you're<00:05:33.270> going<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.449> need<00:05:33.599> to<00:05:33.719> use<00:05:33.750> your

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
system you're going to need to use your

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.279 
system you're going to need to use your
paddle<00:05:34.349> as<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:35.729> can<00:05:35.880> see<00:05:36.120> I'm<00:05:36.389> holding<00:05:37.139> onto

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
paddle as you can see I'm holding onto

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.769 
paddle as you can see I'm holding onto
the<00:05:37.500> sheets<00:05:37.770> here<00:05:38.069> to<00:05:38.909> stop<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.360> sail<00:05:39.599> from

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
the sheets here to stop the sail from

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.740 
the sheets here to stop the sail from
collapsing<00:05:40.440> down<00:05:40.770> into<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:41.729> water<00:05:41.909> so<00:05:42.630> you're

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
collapsing down into the water so you're

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.120 
collapsing down into the water so you're
going<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.229> keep<00:05:43.409> your<00:05:43.590> sheets<00:05:43.830> high

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
going to have to keep your sheets high

the only way to do that if you have a

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.800 
the only way to do that if you have a
paddle<00:05:52.259> is<00:05:53.099> to<00:05:53.279> use<00:05:53.490> your<00:05:53.759> leading<00:05:54.240> hand<00:05:54.449> here

to crimp the sheets and the paddle at

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.490 
to crimp the sheets and the paddle at
the<00:05:58.080> same<00:05:58.319> time<00:05:59.569> the<00:06:00.569> lower<00:06:00.840> blade<00:06:01.169> is<00:06:01.440> going

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
the same time the lower blade is going

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.680 
the same time the lower blade is going

degrees in the wind in this position if
you<00:06:40.800> want<00:06:40.980> to<00:06:41.070> go<00:06:41.220> back<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.700> downwind<00:06:42.090> sailing

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
you want to go back to downwind sailing

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.670 
you want to go back to downwind sailing
you<00:06:43.140> just<00:06:43.380> steer<00:06:43.650> back<00:06:43.920> downwind<00:06:45.470> you<00:06:46.470> can

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
you just steer back downwind you can

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.800 
you just steer back downwind you can
then<00:06:47.120> tighten<00:06:48.120> up<00:06:48.390> the<00:06:48.510> draw<00:06:48.720> cord<00:06:49.080> again<00:06:53.810> and

then tighten up the draw cord again and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.670 
then tighten up the draw cord again and
once<00:06:55.110> again<00:06:56.540> you<00:06:57.540> are<00:06:57.570> now<00:06:57.810> downwind<00:06:58.380> sailing

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
once again you are now downwind sailing

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.150 
once again you are now downwind sailing
and<00:06:59.270> with<00:07:00.270> the<00:07:00.360> sail<00:07:00.570> in<00:07:00.720> this<00:07:00.870> position<00:07:01.410> you

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
and with the sail in this position you

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.010 
and with the sail in this position you
can<00:07:02.340> easily<00:07:02.640> work<00:07:03.000> within<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.540> 90<00:07:03.930> degree

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
can easily work within the 90 degree

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.280 
can easily work within the 90 degree
window<00:07:04.620> of<00:07:04.830> the<00:07:05.550> wind<00:07:05.730> coming<00:07:06.090> at<00:07:06.150> 45<00:07:06.840> degrees

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
window of the wind coming at 45 degrees

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.159 
window of the wind coming at 45 degrees
to<00:07:07.680> the<00:07:07.770> back<00:07:07.980> side<00:07:08.570> either<00:07:09.570> on<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:09.930> windward

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
to the back side either on the windward

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.020 
to the back side either on the windward
side<00:07:10.290> or<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:10.830> leeward<00:07:11.130> side<00:07:11.160> of<00:07:11.550> the<00:07:11.669> kayak
