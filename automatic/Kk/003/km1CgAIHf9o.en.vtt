00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.630
 granting demolition license 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.270

 solve the outpatient trade of 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.640
 trucchi to everything that is questioned 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.610
 wholesaler and everything but that will depend on 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.280
 part of the lawyers who manage to clean up in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.190
 the course of two years or three the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.690
 part of the eight thousand 48 thousand 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.060
 400 square meters where are the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 possessors although the local is 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.050
 within a monumental urban area by 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 a wall that borders the avenue 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.030
 españa martín tuesta assured that the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.100
 regional culture directorate issued the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.229
 document confirming that the square of 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.690
 bulls is not a historical heritage 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.450
 intangible assured that the project will be 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.360
 will run 18 meters from said wall 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 because before starting the project 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.910
 we request a document that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.519
 issue the linense and we have a document 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.950
 in that it is not historical heritage and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.090
 it is an area that is not intangible nor 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190
 we are not in an urban environment either 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.310
 monumental 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.340
 but if it is within an area of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.890
 influence but an influence area like 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.650
 by the wall however our 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.320
 project is on tape and rock at 18 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.680
 meters of the boundary of the terrain that is not 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.310
 we affect in nothing is more we have 14 thousand 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.770
 500 square meters to develop the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 land of 9,000 square meters will be 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.900
 consisting of two store levels 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.240
 and one for warehouses however it 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.370
 plans to plan a third floor for 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.800
 stores for merchants 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.590
 the prices would oscillate between 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.590
 the 9,000 and 9,500 dollars
