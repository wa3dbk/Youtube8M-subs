TRX<00:00:49.610> 350<00:00:50.610> F<00:00:50.940> key<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.309> electric<00:00:53.699> ship<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
TRX 350 F key it's an electric ship so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
TRX 350 F key it's an electric ship so
it<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.719> says<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:57.920> es<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it actually says that it's a es on the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
it actually says that it's a es on the
machine<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> look<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> up

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
machine but actually when you look it up

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.420 
machine but actually when you look it up
it's<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.750> F<00:01:03.989> II<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> anyway<00:01:06.600> um<00:01:07.430> you

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's a it's an F II so anyway um you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
it's a it's an F II so anyway um you
might<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.479> happen<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.710> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
might have this happen to you where it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
might have this happen to you where it
gets<00:01:11.100> stuck<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.640> gear<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:14.490> won't<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.360> got

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
gets stuck in gear and it won't it's got

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.830 
gets stuck in gear and it won't it's got
electric<00:01:16.049> shifts<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.670> can't<00:01:17.939> get<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> out

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
electric shifts so you can't get it out

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.440 
electric shifts so you can't get it out
of<00:01:18.900> gear<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.400> scoop<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.180> on

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
of gear and this is what the scoop is on

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.830 
of gear and this is what the scoop is on
this<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:30.150> shift<00:01:30.509> plate

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is that this side the shift plate

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
this is that this side the shift plate
um<00:01:31.909> is<00:01:32.909> broken

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
um is broken

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
um is broken
oh<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> hard<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:35.520> there

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
oh it's kind of hard to see right there

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.899 
oh it's kind of hard to see right there
but<00:01:36.799> both<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:39.560> tongs<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.979> both<00:01:41.250> sides<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
but both the the tongs on both sides of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.630 
but both the the tongs on both sides of
this<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:43.350> broken<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:46.220> little<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:47.340> hard<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this are broken off a little bit hard to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.389 
this are broken off a little bit hard to
see<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.630> anyway<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.040> broken

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
see it there but anyway this is broken

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.120 
see it there but anyway this is broken
and<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:50.939> why<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.210> won't<00:01:51.390> shift<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:55.130> got

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and that's why it won't shift so got

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
and that's why it won't shift so got
this<00:01:56.340> torn<00:01:56.610> apart<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.240> stuff<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this torn apart and stuff all you got to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.819 
this torn apart and stuff all you got to
do<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> remove<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.180> the<00:02:00.180> front<00:02:00.420> cover

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
do is remove the the front cover

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.190 
do is remove the the front cover
somebody<00:02:01.829> said<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> could<00:02:02.369> actually

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
somebody said that you could actually

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.190 
somebody said that you could actually
probably<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> machine<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.200> it's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
probably do this in the machine but it's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.309 
probably do this in the machine but it's
a<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.500> easier<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.509> super<00:02:10.020> hard<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
a lot easier it's not that super hard to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.479 
a lot easier it's not that super hard to
get<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> here

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
get this out of here

now we're in 2011 and there's no more
recall<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.930> mean<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.410> didn't<00:02:55.650> break

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
recall on this I mean if it didn't break

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.990 
recall on this I mean if it didn't break
by<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.959> they<00:02:58.230> figured<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.700> did

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
by then they figured that they just did

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.240 
by then they figured that they just did
they<00:03:00.269> did<00:03:00.720> use<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> different<00:03:01.440> part<00:03:01.799> number

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
they did use a different part number

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.000 
they did use a different part number
it's<00:03:02.970> got<00:03:03.209> an<00:03:03.299> updated<00:03:03.420> part<00:03:04.049> number<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.560> they

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's got an updated part number so they

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.500 
it's got an updated part number so they
obviously<00:03:05.220> found<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.239> was<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
obviously found that this was a

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.130 
obviously found that this was a
defective<00:03:07.170> piece<00:03:07.579> but<00:03:08.579> there's<00:03:09.450> no<00:03:09.599> Honda

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
defective piece but there's no Honda

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080 
defective piece but there's no Honda
covering<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.190> warranty<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:11.880> anything

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
covering that I'm warranty or anything

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.680 
covering that I'm warranty or anything
like<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
like that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.710 
like that
so<00:03:13.680> anyway<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.819> why<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.180> doesn't<00:03:15.569> shift

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
so anyway that's why it doesn't shift

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.160 
so anyway that's why it doesn't shift
and<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> similar<00:03:18.150> problem<00:03:18.420> and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and if you have a similar problem and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.479 
and if you have a similar problem and
that's<00:03:19.290> probably<00:03:19.739> what<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.100> because

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
that's probably what it is because

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.910 
that's probably what it is because
everything<00:03:20.970> else<00:03:21.090> looks<00:03:21.510> fine<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.049> there<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
everything else looks fine in there the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.530 
everything else looks fine in there the
 into<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> shifter<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.420> can

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
 into the shifter on that you can

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.120 
 into the shifter on that you can
see<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.200> with<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.950> spring<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.639> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
see here with the spring and the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.500 
see here with the spring and the
retainer<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.459> all<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.060> all<00:03:30.209> fine<00:03:30.540> so

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
retainer and all that it's all fine so

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.590 
retainer and all that it's all fine so
that's<00:03:33.510> what's<00:03:33.840> wrong<00:03:34.069> so<00:03:35.069> if<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
that's what's wrong so if you have this

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.170 
that's what's wrong so if you have this
similar<00:03:36.600> problem<00:03:37.170> with<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.590> t<00:03:37.910> rx350

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
similar problem with your t rx350

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.460 
similar problem with your t rx350
efi<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:40.940> there<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:44.959> that's<00:03:45.959> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
efi then there you go so that's it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.170 
efi then there you go so that's it
