00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
was slightly too big and too fat

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.500 
was slightly too big and too fat
compared<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:20.369> original<00:00:20.430> bumble<00:00:21.090> bee<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
compared to the original bumble bee and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.830 
compared to the original bumble bee and
it's<00:00:21.840> off<00:00:22.020> proportion<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> did<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's off proportion so what I did is I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.790 
it's off proportion so what I did is I
have<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.619> strip<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> hands<00:00:27.230> in<00:00:28.230> parts<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
have to strip the hands in parts and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
have to strip the hands in parts and
then<00:00:29.130> rebuild<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> completely<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
then rebuild it completely so here you

then rebuild it completely so here you
see<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.420> a<00:00:33.420> rebuild<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> bumblebees<00:00:35.190> hand

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

also have a wrist joint so it goes you
know<00:00:51.660> abandon<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:53.129> rotates<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.399> will<00:01:00.180> form

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
know abandon it rotates and it will form

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.100 
know abandon it rotates and it will form
a<00:01:00.780> fish

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110

unfortunately I can get a good job with
this<00:01:19.080> camera<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.870> fall<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.350> hand<00:01:26.180> the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
this camera but it will fall my hand the
only<00:01:27.600> thing<00:01:27.870> is<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.710> oh<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> don't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
have enough excuse to make the thumb to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.520 
have enough excuse to make the thumb to
go<00:01:34.880> up<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.300> down<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.840> way<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.010> it<00:01:38.940> can't<00:01:39.540> grab

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
go up and down this way so it can't grab

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.790 
go up and down this way so it can't grab
stuff<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.760> so<00:01:42.690> right<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
stuff like this so right now is in the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.210 
stuff like this so right now is in the
position<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.900> permanently<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> will

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
position of this permanently so it will

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.540 
position of this permanently so it will
go<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:49.009> holding<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.130> fist<00:01:50.340> like

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
go like this but not holding a fist like

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.450 
go like this but not holding a fist like
so<00:01:51.050> um<00:01:53.119> right<00:01:54.119> now<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.840> does<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.830> enough

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
so um right now it does have enough

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.810 
so um right now it does have enough
clearance<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.420> via<00:01:58.110> como<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.250> does<00:01:59.580> wrote

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
clearance in via como so it does wrote

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.469 
clearance in via como so it does wrote
it<00:02:00.479> does<00:02:00.690> roll<00:02:00.930> nicely<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:03.450> almost<00:02:03.920> it's

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
it does roll nicely but it almost it's

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.350 
it does roll nicely but it almost it's
fair<00:02:06.479> there's<00:02:07.410> only<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:08.340> minimum<00:02:09.030> clearance

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
fair there's only very minimum clearance

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.000 
fair there's only very minimum clearance
um<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.820> mean<00:02:12.270> you're<00:02:12.600> not<00:02:13.010> playing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
um but then I mean you're not playing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.210 
um but then I mean you're not playing
with<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.670> toy<00:02:14.910> rolling<00:02:15.360> all<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.830> down<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
with the toy rolling all up and down the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.479 
with the toy rolling all up and down the
street<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.900> would<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.320> okay<00:02:20.150> um

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
street so I think that would be okay um

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.970 
street so I think that would be okay um
but<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.180> why<00:02:24.450> i<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.840> um<00:02:26.150> done<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.390> far<00:02:27.660> I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
but that is why i have um done so far I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.789 
but that is why i have um done so far I
got<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.330> response<00:02:30.330> from<00:02:30.480> another<00:02:31.019> guy<00:02:31.320> saying

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
got a response from another guy saying

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.470 
got a response from another guy saying
the<00:02:32.400> lake<00:02:32.790> panel<00:02:33.299> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.799> thigh<00:02:35.070> he<00:02:35.760> said<00:02:36.150> that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the lake panel on the thigh he said that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.970 
the lake panel on the thigh he said that
it<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:37.200> supposed<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.920> rotate<00:02:38.910> forward<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.680> on

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
it was supposed to rotate forward but on

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.759 
it was supposed to rotate forward but on
the<00:02:41.790> problem<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.420> when<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> flip<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.230> forward

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the problem is when you flip it forward

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.060 
the problem is when you flip it forward
it<00:02:44.040> opened<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.239> which<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.830> looks

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it opened it like so which it looks

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.880 
it opened it like so which it looks
slightly<00:02:47.640> retarded<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:49.110> me<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.620> um<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:51.860> flip<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
slightly retarded to me so um I flip it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.870 
slightly retarded to me so um I flip it
down<00:02:53.400> onto<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.330> side<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.470> thigh<00:02:56.100> because

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
down onto the side of the thigh because

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.160 
down onto the side of the thigh because
you<00:02:57.239> know<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.709> less<00:02:59.100> bulky<00:02:59.640> um<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.900> doesn't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
you know it is less bulky um it doesn't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.530 
you know it is less bulky um it doesn't

so<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.790> only<00:03:14.970> way<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.600> think<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.959> is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
so the only way that I can think of is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.860 
so the only way that I can think of is
too<00:03:16.380> full<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.860> down<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.150> one<00:03:18.600> you

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
too full of it down or if you one you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.590 
too full of it down or if you one you
can<00:03:19.049> flip<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.739> back<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:21.000> doesn't

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
can flip it on the back but it doesn't

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.479 
can flip it on the back but it doesn't
look<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.780> good<00:03:22.140> either<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:23.040> don't

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
look that good either so I don't

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.660 
look that good either so I don't
recommend<00:03:23.790> it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
recommend it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.100
