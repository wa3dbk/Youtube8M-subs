for<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.159> output<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:25.970> need<00:03:26.180> two<00:03:26.420> solenoids

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.100

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.340 

the<00:04:01.100> question<00:04:01.640> marks<00:04:01.970> indicate<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:03.170> there

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
the question marks indicate that there

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.260 
the question marks indicate that there
are<00:04:03.470> quite<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.740> few<00:04:03.890> variables<00:04:04.460> that<00:04:04.940> need<00:04:05.150> to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
are quite a few variables that need to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.770 
are quite a few variables that need to
be<00:04:05.390> assigned

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.430 

beginning<00:04:13.709> with<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:14.010> valve<00:04:14.600> we<00:04:15.600> see<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
beginning with the valve we see that the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650 
beginning with the valve we see that the
solenoid<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.160> left<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.700> identified<00:04:18.420> as

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
solenoid on the left is identified as

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.490 
solenoid on the left is identified as
saw<00:04:18.959> one<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:20.670> one<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.090> right<00:04:21.329> as<00:04:21.690> Saul

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
saw one and the one on the right as Saul

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.430 
saw one and the one on the right as Saul
-<00:04:25.850> so<00:04:26.850> we<00:04:27.360> assign<00:04:27.690> these<00:04:27.900> variables

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
- so we assign these variables

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:39.210 
- so we assign these variables
respectively

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.090 

the<00:04:39.790> proximity<00:04:40.480> switches<00:04:40.750> are<00:04:41.260> linked<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.980> the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the proximity switches are linked to the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:58.180
