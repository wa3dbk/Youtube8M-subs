sturdy and whatnot and here to actually
learn<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.090> put<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> trade<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:09.690> an<00:03:09.870> item<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.440> have

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
learn to put a trade on an item you have

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.289 
learn to put a trade on an item you have
to<00:03:10.739> destroy<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.310> item<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.910> already<00:03:12.090> has

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
to destroy that item that already has

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.900 
to destroy that item that already has
that<00:03:12.540> trait<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.560> over<00:03:13.799> time<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.640> you

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
that trait and then over time you you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.090 
that trait and then over time you you
learn<00:03:15.060> how<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.299> do<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.320> become<00:03:16.890> one

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
learn how to do that so you become one

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.220 
learn how to do that so you become one
of<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> crafters<00:03:17.790> who<00:03:17.820> can<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.690> start<00:03:19.049> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
of the crafters who can really start to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.320 
of the crafters who can really start to
specialize<00:03:19.769> they<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.580> know<00:03:20.700> all<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> traits

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
specialize they you know all the traits

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.729 
specialize they you know all the traits

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
useful to you in some way in crafting if

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.140 
useful to you in some way in crafting if
only<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.080> advance<00:03:43.380> your<00:03:43.560> skill<00:03:43.769> more<00:03:44.150> so

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
only to just advance your skill more so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.820 
only to just advance your skill more so
the<00:03:45.269> entire<00:03:45.480> world<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.590> really

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
the entire world is really is really

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.620 
the entire world is really is really
integrated<00:03:47.310> into<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.580> system<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.360> idea<00:03:48.600> is

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
integrated into that system the idea is

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.940 
integrated into that system the idea is
really<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.900> give<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.290> high<00:03:49.560> level<00:03:49.830> of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
really to give you a high level of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.710 
really to give you a high level of
control<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.910> you're<00:03:51.030> controlling<00:03:51.330> not<00:03:51.510> only

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
control so you're controlling not only

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.750 
control so you're controlling not only
the<00:03:51.840> material<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.440> made<00:03:52.500> out<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.489> level

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the material it's made out of the level

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.789 
the material it's made out of the level
it's<00:03:53.880> made<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.110> look<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> and

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
it's made out of but the look of it and

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.110 
it's made out of but the look of it and
then<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.010> course<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.340> innate<00:03:56.549> properties<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
then of course the innate properties of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.180 
then of course the innate properties of
all<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.420> items<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.650> could<00:03:58.799> really<00:03:59.010> kind

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
all the items here you could really kind

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.680 
all the items here you could really kind
of<00:03:59.250> create<00:03:59.519> some<00:03:59.670> cool<00:03:59.850> stuff<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.570> this

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
of create some cool stuff here in this

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.259 
of create some cool stuff here in this
case<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:01.830> choose<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.040> make<00:04:02.280> Akagi<00:04:02.790> armor

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
case you can choose to make Akagi armor

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.970 
case you can choose to make Akagi armor
that<00:04:03.450> looks<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> kajeet<00:04:04.200> style<00:04:04.470> versus

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
that looks like the kajeet style versus

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.920 
that looks like the kajeet style versus
whichever<00:04:05.670> else<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.030> might<00:04:06.269> want<00:04:06.570> in<00:04:06.840> this

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
whichever else you might want in this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.720 
whichever else you might want in this
case<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.350> make<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> sheet<00:04:07.769> because<00:04:07.920> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
case you can make a sheet because you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.730 
case you can make a sheet because you
are<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> CAD<00:04:09.120> and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
are a CAD and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.950 
are a CAD and
and<00:04:09.860> I<00:04:10.220> think<00:04:10.550> again<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.720> thing<00:04:11.930> to

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
and I think again just the thing to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.260 
and I think again just the thing to
emphasize<00:04:12.380> here<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:13.000> creating<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.060> very

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
emphasize here is creating this very

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.940 
emphasize here is creating this very
custom<00:04:14.600> piece<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:14.810> gear<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:15.770> case

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
custom piece of gear and in this case

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.479 
custom piece of gear and in this case
maybe<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.489> simple<00:04:16.790> one<00:04:17.410> that's<00:04:18.410> uh<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:19.370> a

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
maybe it's a simple one that's uh just a

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.580 
maybe it's a simple one that's uh just a
chess<00:04:19.730> piece<00:04:19.910> o<00:04:20.270> nights<00:04:20.750> which<00:04:20.959> there<00:04:21.230> yeah

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
chess piece o nights which there yeah

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.470 
chess piece o nights which there yeah
let's<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.860> but<00:04:22.790> as<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.030> play<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.360> game

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
let's just but as you play the game

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.390 
let's just but as you play the game
longer<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.230> longer<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.530> might<00:04:24.710> find<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
longer and longer you might find the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.250 
longer and longer you might find the
opportunity<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.090> use<00:04:26.420> different<00:04:26.750> styles<00:04:27.050> and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
opportunity to use different styles and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.890 
opportunity to use different styles and
the<00:04:28.270> mechanisms<00:04:29.270> that's<00:04:29.450> accomplished

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the mechanisms that's accomplished

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.020 
the mechanisms that's accomplished
through<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.230> via<00:04:30.470> these<00:04:30.680> racial<00:04:31.430> motifs<00:04:31.880> that

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
through is via these racial motifs that

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.970 
through is via these racial motifs that
you<00:04:32.300> find<00:04:32.600> all<00:04:33.020> throughout<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.290> world<00:04:33.530> that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
you find all throughout the world that

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.160 
you find all throughout the world that
will<00:04:34.130> teach<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.760> different<00:04:35.030> style<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.780> gear

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
will teach you a different style of gear
