minute the goal is to make seven shots
in<00:05:57.940> one<00:05:58.060> minute<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.599> very<00:05:59.139> good<00:05:59.319> college-level

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
in one minute a very good college-level

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.920 
in one minute a very good college-level
player<00:06:00.190> may<00:06:00.759> only<00:06:00.910> get<00:06:01.090> off<00:06:01.240> eight<00:06:01.509> to<00:06:01.690> ten

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930
