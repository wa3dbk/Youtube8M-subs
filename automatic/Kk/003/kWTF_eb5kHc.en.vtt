00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050

on the other hand the lighter part or
you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.690> say<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.410> rougher<00:01:13.680> part<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.160> ball

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you can say the rougher part of the ball

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
you can say the rougher part of the ball
is<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> left<00:01:15.240> side<00:01:15.360> facing<00:01:16.260> towards<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> extra

is on left side facing towards the extra

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.750 
is on left side facing towards the extra
cover<00:01:17.610> region

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.040 

now<00:01:24.480> try<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> project<00:01:25.590> our<00:01:25.980> wisdom<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.150> towards

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
now try to project our wisdom on towards

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.650 
now try to project our wisdom on towards
outside<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> apps<00:01:28.950> terms<00:01:29.280> such<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
outside the apps terms such that the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.930 
outside the apps terms such that the
directional<00:01:31.140> version<00:01:31.620> of<00:01:31.740> seen<00:01:32.070> should<00:01:32.670> face

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
directional version of seen should face

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.520 
directional version of seen should face
the<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.750> region

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.209 

but<00:01:42.530> magically<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.969> just<00:01:44.479> reverses<00:01:45.079> are<00:01:45.259> most

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
but magically it just reverses are most

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.370 
but magically it just reverses are most
oppositely<00:01:46.789> in<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> air<00:01:47.450> into<00:01:48.289> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
oppositely in the air into the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
oppositely in the air into the
right-handed<00:01:48.829> batsman

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.000 

you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.440 

so<00:02:04.010> when<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.340> are<00:02:04.430> trying<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.850> push<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.270> ball

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
so when you are trying to push the ball

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.290 
so when you are trying to push the ball
away<00:02:06.110> from<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.619> batsman<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.400> moves<00:02:07.790> magically

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
away from the batsman it moves magically

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.510 
away from the batsman it moves magically
into<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.660> batsman<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.259> mean<00:02:09.740> when<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.220> shiny

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
into the batsman I mean when the shiny

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
into the batsman I mean when the shiny
shot<00:02:10.759> with<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.940> ball<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.390> facing<00:02:11.870> towards

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
shot with the ball is facing towards

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.970 
shot with the ball is facing towards
batsman<00:02:12.980> well<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.819> reason<00:02:14.120> behind<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.690> is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
batsman well the reason behind this is

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.160 
batsman well the reason behind this is
when<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> moves<00:02:16.459> falsely<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.450> air<00:02:17.720> what

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
when it moves falsely in the air what

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.150 
when it moves falsely in the air what
happens<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.459> air<00:02:19.989> travels<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.830> coming

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
happens is the air travels the coming

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
happens is the air travels the coming
air<00:02:22.370> travels<00:02:23.330> more<00:02:23.959> fastly<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.730> amount<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
air travels more fastly or the amount of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.930 
air travels more fastly or the amount of
air<00:02:26.480> travels<00:02:27.020> more<00:02:27.319> on<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.310> lighter<00:02:28.520> part<00:02:28.850> of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
air travels more on the lighter part of

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.470 
air travels more on the lighter part of
the<00:02:29.090> ball<00:02:29.270> which<00:02:30.110> means<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.739> left<00:02:30.950> side

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the ball which means on the left side

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.229 
the ball which means on the left side
which<00:02:32.480> makes<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.709> ball<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.160> push<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.670> opposite

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
which makes the ball to push in opposite

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.870 
which makes the ball to push in opposite
direction<00:02:35.540> which<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> heavier<00:02:36.769> side<00:02:37.010> okay

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
direction which is the heavier side okay

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.940 
direction which is the heavier side okay
missing<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> reason<00:02:38.959> why<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.739> ball

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
missing the reason why with ball

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.790 
missing the reason why with ball
reverses<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.600> say<00:02:41.750> why<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.200> ball<00:02:42.500> is

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
reverses and we can say why the ball is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.059 
reverses and we can say why the ball is
crucial<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.700> opposite<00:02:44.209> dancing<00:02:45.069> therefore

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
crucial in opposite dancing therefore

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.590 
crucial in opposite dancing therefore
since<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> right<00:02:47.030> side<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.450> body

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
since the right side of the body

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.660 
since the right side of the body
behavior<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.380> left<00:02:48.980> side<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> ball<00:02:49.550> is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
behavior and left side of the ball is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.300 
behavior and left side of the ball is
lighter<00:02:50.170> obviously<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.680> large<00:02:51.890> amount<00:02:52.220> of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
lighter obviously the large amount of

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
lighter obviously the large amount of
air<00:02:52.610> will<00:02:53.269> travel<00:02:53.569> towards<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.560> lighter<00:02:55.069> side

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
air will travel towards the lighter side

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.949 
air will travel towards the lighter side
which<00:02:57.530> actually<00:02:57.880> pushes<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.060> heavier<00:02:59.420> fed<00:02:59.720> or

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
which actually pushes the heavier fed or

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.860 
which actually pushes the heavier fed or
in<00:03:00.380> fact<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.980> can<00:03:01.130> say<00:03:01.370> pushes<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.390> shiny

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
in fact you can say pushes the shiny

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.530 
in fact you can say pushes the shiny
side<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.380> ball<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:04.040> opposite<00:03:04.550> or<00:03:04.700> reverse

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
side of the ball in opposite or reverse

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
side of the ball in opposite or reverse
direction<00:03:05.750> mowing<00:03:06.709> in<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.950> air<00:03:07.220> into<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
direction mowing in the air into the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:19.550 
direction mowing in the air into the
batsman

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.490 

so<00:03:20.160> at<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.970> end<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.330> day<00:03:21.450> what<00:03:21.930> happens<00:03:22.319> is

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
so at the end of the day what happens is

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.630 
so at the end of the day what happens is
the<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.420> clearly<00:03:24.420> pushes<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.020> mean<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the a clearly pushes I mean the the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.199 
the a clearly pushes I mean the the
amount<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.090> air<00:03:27.650> travels<00:03:28.650> more<00:03:29.280> towards<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
amount of air travels more towards a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.449 
amount of air travels more towards a
lighter<00:03:30.420> part<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.959> ball<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.680> fact<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
lighter part of the ball in fact the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.820 
lighter part of the ball in fact the
lesser<00:03:32.880> weight<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.780> travels<00:03:34.290> towards<00:03:34.740> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
lesser weight it travels towards the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.770 
lesser weight it travels towards the
lighter<00:03:35.010> part<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.520> ball<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.880> pushes<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
lighter part of the ball and pushes the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:04:30.610 
lighter part of the ball and pushes the
heavier<00:03:37.200> part<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.920> opposite<00:03:38.370> direction

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:42.050 

you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060
