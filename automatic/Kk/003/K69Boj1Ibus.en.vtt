can find all of them in the description
down<00:00:15.630> below<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.830> directly<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.460> hit<00:00:17.730> over

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
down below so directly we have hit over

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.960 
down below so directly we have hit over
100<00:00:18.270> million<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.560> items<00:00:20.130> available<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.789> ask

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
100 million the items available to ask

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.689 
100 million the items available to ask
just<00:00:21.449> expands<00:00:22.109> greatly<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.189> flip<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
just expands greatly we can now flip so

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
just expands greatly we can now flip so
many<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.000> drag<00:00:24.269> wars<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> same<00:00:24.900> time<00:00:25.109> we

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
many more drag wars at the same time we

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
many more drag wars at the same time we
can<00:00:25.920> flip<00:00:26.220> ascension<00:00:26.730> crossbows<00:00:27.150> because

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
can flip ascension crossbows because

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
can flip ascension crossbows because
they<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.599> dropped<00:00:27.840> implies<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.400> amount

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
they have dropped implies so the amount

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.040 
they have dropped implies so the amount
of<00:00:29.670> items<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.300> opened<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.929> us<00:00:30.990> now

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of items that have opened up to us now

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
of items that have opened up to us now
is<00:00:31.500> incredible<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> directly<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.210> reach

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is incredible and directly we reach

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 
is incredible and directly we reach
about<00:00:33.630> 150<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> 200<00:00:34.800> million<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.640> opens<00:00:36.000> up

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
about 150 to 200 million it opens up

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
about 150 to 200 million it opens up
again<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:37.020> instead<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> making<00:00:37.590> about<00:00:37.739> 10

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
again so instead of making about 10

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
again so instead of making about 10
million<00:00:38.160> papers<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.910> move<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> about

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
million papers I will move up to about

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
million papers I will move up to about
15<00:00:39.870> million<00:00:40.200> per<00:00:40.320> episode<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.860> then

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
15 million per episode and then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
15 million per episode and then
eventually<00:00:41.460> 20<00:00:42.120> 30<00:00:42.450> 50<00:00:42.750> even<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> 100

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
eventually 20 30 50 even up to like 100

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430 
eventually 20 30 50 even up to like 100
million<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.309> may<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.579> our<00:00:44.910> last<00:00:45.149> episode<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
million on may be our last episode so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
million on may be our last episode so

made<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> each<00:01:21.540> flip<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> general

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
made on each flip so you get a general

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.390 
made on each flip so you get a general
idea<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.850> better<00:01:24.030> feel<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.869> each<00:01:24.930> item<00:01:25.400> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
idea and a better feel for each item so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
idea and a better feel for each item so
I<00:01:26.430> started<00:01:26.759> off<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.150> flipping<00:01:27.479> series<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:27.840> knew

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I started off my flipping series i knew

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.539 
I started off my flipping series i knew
that<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.710> could<00:01:28.770> flip<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> Ascension

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that i could flip the Ascension

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.649 
that i could flip the Ascension
crossbows<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.150> they're<00:01:30.299> dropped<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
crossbows because they're dropped in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260 
crossbows because they're dropped in
pies<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.159> wanted<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> flip<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pies and I really wanted to flip two of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.550 
pies and I really wanted to flip two of
the<00:01:33.390> main<00:01:33.540> hand<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.049> two<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> offhand

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the main hand and two of the offhand

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
the main hand and two of the offhand
because<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.340> exactly<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.880> much<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> can

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
because that's exactly how much you can

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
because that's exactly how much you can
buy<00:01:36.570> every<00:01:36.990> four<00:01:37.259> hours<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> did<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.520> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
buy every four hours so what I did was I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
buy every four hours so what I did was I
went<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> buy<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.020> sadly<00:01:40.590> they

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
went in to buy them but sadly they

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
went in to buy them but sadly they
weren't<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.610> good<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.909> profit<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.479> thought

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
weren't as good as profit as I thought

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
weren't as good as profit as I thought
they<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.890> expecting<00:01:44.040> easily

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
they would be I was expecting easily

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
they would be I was expecting easily
over<00:01:45.000> 1<00:01:45.180> million<00:01:45.390> profit<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.530> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
over 1 million profit but because I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
over 1 million profit but because I
bought<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.220> dropping<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.180> meant<00:01:48.509> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
bought them also dropping it meant that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
bought them also dropping it meant that
people<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.110> constantly<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.100> dropping

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
people will constantly you know dropping

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.399 
people will constantly you know dropping
their<00:01:50.549> sale<00:01:50.759> price<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> many

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
their sale price but not that many

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.899 
their sale price but not that many
people<00:01:52.530> who<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:52.979> wising<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.640> price

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
people who are wising there by price

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
people who are wising there by price
because<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.270> knew<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> was<00:01:54.720> dropping<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
because they knew it was dropping so it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
because they knew it was dropping so it
was<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> hard<00:01:56.759> time<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.210> me<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> thought<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
was a hard time for me so I thought I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
was a hard time for me so I thought I
could<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.229> about<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> million<00:01:58.920> per<00:01:59.070> flip

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
could make about a million per flip

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
could make about a million per flip
which<00:01:59.820> means<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.479> expecting<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:00.990> 4

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
which means that i was expecting about 4

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
which means that i was expecting about 4
million<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.799> flipping<00:02:02.130> two<00:02:02.340> main<00:02:02.579> hands<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
million for flipping two main hands and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
million for flipping two main hands and
two<00:02:03.090> offhand<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.229> only<00:02:04.439> managed<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> make

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
two offhand but I only managed to make

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.260 
two offhand but I only managed to make
about<00:02:05.840> 700<00:02:06.840> k<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> profit<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.270> 1.5

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
about 700 k and a profit then a 1.5

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.460 
about 700 k and a profit then a 1.5
million<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.200> about<00:02:10.700> slightly<00:02:11.700> under

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
million so about slightly under

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
million so about slightly under
point<00:02:13.740> seven<00:02:14.130> million<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:14.820> four<00:02:15.030> items

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
point seven million for all four items

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.660 
point seven million for all four items
which<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.660> still<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.140> bad<00:02:16.350> for<00:02:16.590> about<00:02:17.160> 45

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
which is still not that bad for about 45

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.310 
which is still not that bad for about 45
minutes<00:02:17.910> work<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.960> was<00:02:19.050> actually<00:02:19.140> pretty

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
minutes work so that was actually pretty

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.740 
minutes work so that was actually pretty
decent<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> by<00:02:20.790> half<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.120> from<00:02:21.270> my<00:02:21.390> episode

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
decent so by half way from my episode

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.120 
decent so by half way from my episode
after<00:02:21.960> buying<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.500> selling<00:02:22.530> my<00:02:22.770> decision

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
after buying and selling my decision

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.070 
after buying and selling my decision
crossbows<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:24.060> moved<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.420> into<00:02:24.600> my<00:02:24.720> drug

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
crossbows I then moved on into my drug

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.780 
crossbows I then moved on into my drug
wars<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> knew<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.100> drug<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:26.580> pretty

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
wars now I knew that drug was pretty

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.630 
wars now I knew that drug was pretty
good<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:28.650> keeping<00:02:29.070> an<00:02:29.280> eye<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
good because I was keeping an eye on the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.860 
good because I was keeping an eye on the
matters<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.120> people<00:02:30.450> buying<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.840> selling

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
matters that people buying and selling

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.260 
matters that people buying and selling
them<00:02:31.080> quite<00:02:31.410> fast<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> did<00:02:32.730> expect<00:02:32.880> them<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
them quite fast so I did expect them to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.520 
them quite fast so I did expect them to
take<00:02:33.390> about<00:02:33.540> 10<00:02:33.750> minutes<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.050> buying<00:02:34.230> than<00:02:34.380> 10

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
take about 10 minutes of buying than 10

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.080 
take about 10 minutes of buying than 10
minutes<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.800> sale<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.610> they<00:02:35.700> didn't<00:02:35.970> take

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
minutes of sale and if they didn't take

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
minutes of sale and if they didn't take
that<00:02:36.120> long<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.720> knew<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> my<00:02:37.260> prices<00:02:37.740> were<00:02:37.860> out

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that long I knew that my prices were out

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
that long I knew that my prices were out
so<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:38.790> did<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:39.090> take<00:02:39.360> me<00:02:39.510> about<00:02:39.630> five<00:02:39.870> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
so he did actually take me about five to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.870 
so he did actually take me about five to
ten<00:02:40.200> minutes<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.590> buy<00:02:40.740> them<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.760> took

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
ten minutes to buy them and then it took

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.850 
ten minutes to buy them and then it took
me<00:02:42.060> another<00:02:42.210> 10<00:02:42.540> minutes<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:42.930> sale<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.410> was

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
me another 10 minutes or sale but I was

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670 
me another 10 minutes or sale but I was
really<00:02:44.100> happy<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.230> only<00:02:46.230> had<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> drop<00:02:46.620> my

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
really happy that I only had to drop my

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
really happy that I only had to drop my
place<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> little<00:02:47.430> bit<00:02:47.550> i<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:48.180> looking<00:02:48.390> at

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
place a little bit i was looking at

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.050 
place a little bit i was looking at
about<00:02:48.690> 600<00:02:49.050> 700<00:02:49.770> k<00:02:49.830> profit<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.280> first<00:02:50.490> but

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
about 600 700 k profit at first but

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.270 
about 600 700 k profit at first but
because<00:02:51.660> people<00:02:52.380> were<00:02:52.500> updating<00:02:53.010> them<00:02:53.130> quite

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
because people were updating them quite

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800 
because people were updating them quite
often<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.640> their<00:02:53.730> friendship<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.570> tend

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
often in their friendship and they tend

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.300 
often in their friendship and they tend
to<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> little<00:02:55.140> bit<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.709> hundred<00:02:56.100> k

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
to be a little bit like a hundred k

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220

really<00:04:36.600> worth<00:04:36.780> joining<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.260> furniture

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
really worth joining that furniture

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.080 
really worth joining that furniture
today<00:04:37.740> because<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.370> margins<00:04:38.699> were<00:04:38.820> really

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
today because the margins were really

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.909 
today because the margins were really
good<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:40.229> best<00:04:40.440> thing<00:04:40.590> about<00:04:40.680> that

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
good and the best thing about that

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.219 
good and the best thing about that
French<00:04:41.160> said<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:42.030> they<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.330> some

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
French said is that they have some

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.320 
French said is that they have some
decent<00:04:43.830> people<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.699> actually<00:04:44.850> flip<00:04:45.180> in

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
decent people that actually flip in

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.060 
decent people that actually flip in
there<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:46.020> actually<00:04:46.139> always<00:04:46.560> look<00:04:46.860> for<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
there that actually always look for the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.189 
there that actually always look for the
best<00:04:47.190> margin<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:47.850> there<00:04:48.030> isn't<00:04:48.270> people<00:04:48.570> over

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
best margin so there isn't people over

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.350 
best margin so there isn't people over
cutting<00:04:49.560> undercutting<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.790> usually<00:04:50.970> all

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
cutting undercutting you usually all

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.360 
cutting undercutting you usually all
managed<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.199> get<00:04:52.290> around<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.560> same<00:04:52.740> profit<00:04:53.160> so

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
managed to get around the same profit so

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.920 
managed to get around the same profit so
that's<00:04:53.550> actually<00:04:53.790> pretty<00:04:53.880> decent<00:04:54.090> also<00:04:54.690> of

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
that's actually pretty decent also of

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.439 
that's actually pretty decent also of
course<00:04:55.590> though<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.860> did<00:04:56.130> have<00:04:56.160> my<00:04:56.340> fellow<00:04:56.970> items

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
course though I did have my fellow items

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.050 
course though I did have my fellow items
where<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.750> accidentally<00:04:58.620> sold<00:04:58.889> to<00:04:59.250> cheap<00:04:59.490> where

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
where I accidentally sold to cheap where

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.730 
where I accidentally sold to cheap where
for<00:05:00.330> example<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.780> Banda's<00:05:01.110> clubs<00:05:01.350> here<00:05:01.530> I

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
for example the Banda's clubs here I

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.340 
for example the Banda's clubs here I
sold<00:05:02.010> for<00:05:02.190> just<00:05:02.220> 41<00:05:02.699> k<00:05:02.970> profit<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.570> usually

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
sold for just 41 k profit and usually

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.050 
sold for just 41 k profit and usually
I'd<00:05:04.500> expect<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:05.039> lot<00:05:05.310> more<00:05:05.370> than<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.729> about

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
I'd expect a lot more than that about

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.159 
I'd expect a lot more than that about
150<00:05:06.600> k<00:05:06.930> but<00:05:07.500> sadly<00:05:08.360> mistakes<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:09.570> happen<00:05:09.600> where

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
150 k but sadly mistakes do happen where

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.750 
150 k but sadly mistakes do happen where
you<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:11.010> know<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.220> price<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.430> an<00:05:11.669> item

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
you think you know the price of an item

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.890 
you think you know the price of an item
and<00:05:12.120> then<00:05:12.180> you're<00:05:12.300> going<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.510> sell<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.720> and

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and then you're going to sell it and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.170 
and then you're going to sell it and
just<00:05:13.020> instantly<00:05:13.770> sales<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:14.310> then<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:15.000> make<00:05:15.150> a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
just instantly sales and then you make a

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.580 
just instantly sales and then you make a
lot<00:05:15.419> less<00:05:15.630> profit<00:05:15.960> than<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.199> normally<00:05:16.350> it

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
lot less profit than you normally it

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.070 
lot less profit than you normally it
expected<00:05:17.130> but<00:05:17.880> i<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.630> don't<00:05:18.990> really

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
expected but i just don't really

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.779 
expected but i just don't really
understand<00:05:19.620> why<00:05:19.830> for<00:05:20.100> some<00:05:20.220> reason<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.639> the

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
understand why for some reason like the

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.400 
understand why for some reason like the
bandos<00:05:21.090> helmet<00:05:21.419> hit<00:05:21.510> for<00:05:21.660> example<00:05:22.050> there<00:05:22.260> is

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
bandos helmet hit for example there is

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.490 
bandos helmet hit for example there is
selling<00:05:23.220> fifty<00:05:24.030> percent<00:05:24.419> above<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.320> guide

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
selling fifty percent above the guide

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.040 
selling fifty percent above the guide
price<00:05:25.880> there<00:05:26.880> well<00:05:27.389> as<00:05:27.479> far<00:05:27.690> as<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.840> could<00:05:27.900> see

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
price there well as far as I could see

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.409 
price there well as far as I could see
there<00:05:28.440> was<00:05:28.470> no<00:05:28.710> real<00:05:28.949> update<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:30.030> raise<00:05:30.240> the

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
there was no real update to raise the

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.339 
there was no real update to raise the
price<00:05:30.600> by<00:05:30.630> fifty<00:05:31.229> percent<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:33.020> think<00:05:34.020> that's

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
price by fifty percent so I think that's

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.140 
price by fifty percent so I think that's
why<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:35.099> were<00:05:35.190> able<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.460> get<00:05:35.610> good<00:05:35.760> profits

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
why you were able to get good profits

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.730 
why you were able to get good profits
today<00:05:36.210> because<00:05:36.570> prices<00:05:36.840> just<00:05:37.229> all<00:05:37.440> over<00:05:37.470> the

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
today because prices just all over the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.790 
today because prices just all over the
place<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.300> finally<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.539> was<00:05:40.050> getting<00:05:40.289> up<00:05:40.410> to

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
place and finally I was getting up to

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.950 
place and finally I was getting up to
about<00:05:41.580> two<00:05:41.849> hours<00:05:41.970> worth<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.300> flipping<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:42.870> I

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
about two hours worth of flipping and I

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.570 
about two hours worth of flipping and I
was<00:05:43.169> going<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.380> do<00:05:43.500> an<00:05:43.620> overnight<00:05:44.010> flip<00:05:44.310> and

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
was going to do an overnight flip and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.070 
was going to do an overnight flip and
add<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.240> into<00:05:45.330> this<00:05:45.479> episode<00:05:45.870> of<00:05:45.900> the

Ascension<00:05:46.470> crossbow<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.460> I<00:05:47.490> decided<00:05:47.789> because

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
Ascension crossbow but I decided because

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.700 
Ascension crossbow but I decided because
they<00:05:48.120> were<00:05:48.210> dropping<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:49.050> would<00:05:49.289> be<00:05:49.410> best<00:05:49.590> to

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
they were dropping it would be best to

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.680 
they were dropping it would be best to
take<00:05:49.919> out<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.190> item<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.729> tried<00:05:51.539> out<00:05:51.570> some
