 user data occurs 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 automatically in your case will happen 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.680
 a mistake in writing that he cannot 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.120
 produce error code ate full 19 5 0 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.650

 hold it off after that again 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.600

 doing with the swing, press minutes 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.209
 turn off translate again he writes again 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.959
 the same error and this procedure will need 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.930
 to repeat 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:52.160

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.269
 the only bridge option is not so much 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.150
