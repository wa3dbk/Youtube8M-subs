works so you put it there push down and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.299 
works so you put it there push down and
it<00:00:44.429> takes<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.909> core<00:00:45.179> right<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
it takes the core right out so this is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.389
