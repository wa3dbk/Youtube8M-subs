00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello today we are not a set 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.099
 Therefore, I am a reviewer and this name 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.589
 read the same avengers just such 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.630
 here is a mulib narrow set wherever 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.460
 there is an inscription marvel avengers 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.400
 images of some of these 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.140
 guys everything is very expensive this set 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.630
 no exception quite expensive let's 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.180
 see if it is interesting and worth it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.910
 blessing produces company hasbro 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 so it will be good quality all 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.609
 but still too small and naborchik 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.739
 very interesting to me what are they 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.899
 imply here so small 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.089
 typesetter and here is the price 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.819
 is it really justified and or is it 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:50.079
 just for fans who are just that 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:53.050
 you bought something so we see what 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.620
 inside inside as usual instruction sleep 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.399
 instructions for warning further such 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.120
 two parts and here's an iron man 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.620
 all this we remove let's start with here 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.700
 This character is what I take out 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.410
 behind the altron robot with curves 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.910
 pistols okay that will get all better 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.940
 let's take a closer look 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.980
 his hands are not taken 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.290
 fall off it's optional because 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.530
 you can collect some big man 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.870
 a huge enemy like this 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.760
 near as you see from such 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.380
 translucent plastic with some kind of 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.190
 holes like this you take off your hand 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.170
 see easy and simple and so cool 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.680
 painted you will see even the eyes of another 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.070
 silver colors right here and this one 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.520
 transparent plastic is such 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 how would get practical cyber legs 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.800
 legs strange and what to do with them 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 nothing we have to half 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.750
 these are here the enemy and we are his here and so 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.990
 set it looks like it looks at all 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.020
 funny and bring a gun to look like 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.080
 more fun his blaster or what it is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.410
 this thing when I watched the avengers but 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 I'm not so straight straight straight there such 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.700
 an attentive viewer wouldn't care 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.610
 there was more action and there was some 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 little one didn't remember such a bun there 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.520
 work of this but an iron man and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.290
 everyone remembered the iron man a 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.020
 looks despite being very small 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 he looks pretty funny too 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.000
 here a hole in the back can be something 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.430
 it is possible to attach a very daga clumsy 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.040
 mobility but as usual principle y 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.530
 a small toy was probably difficult 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.100
 would make cool mobility whether 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.360
 would grow even more expensive 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.840
 hands here it is the hand in his fist and 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.640
 Here is such an iron man 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.560
 turned out a small set let's show 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.050
 closer iron man at the beginning and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.940
 then I will say in about a set for a person 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.630
 you will be my friend here's the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.550
 question then look ka 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.030
 let's try it on the table just 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.920
 put guys do not look at the costs 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.690
 this person falls 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.500
 well let's do it will be 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.180
 hold his rival 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.610
 like this the enemy will show you show you 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.080
 closer iron man well here 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.160
 dyed dyed see everything well 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.290
 all the details all the elements here are gold 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.130
 Seneca and even some elements in the back are not 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.840
 stained 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.950
 this is normal and practical details 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.410
 very nice little mugs so but 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.810
 yet the joke of this set is that 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.910
 tass well pasted over all the truth will 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.760
 unstick or not so that children wo n't drag 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.020
 from toy stores here to the store 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.120
 and so stick up with such things spoils 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.120
 packaging that someone could be this is important 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.420
 why can you collect something like that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.900
 unimaginable huge 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.280
 don't top over here to land our villain from 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.579
 different different parts 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.400
 we collect there many different sets 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.980
 different kits different parts of these 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.620
 of this torso and 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.890
 different characters are also like that 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.960
 decide whether it is worth it or not 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.660
 sold in children's stores in many 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.000
 children's world for example or others and here 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.330
 so that looks funny cool in 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.390
 principle but incomprehensible for playing games 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.180
 I think it will come down well for the collection 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:51.160
 also maybe why here 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.720

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.640
 if i do 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.840
 and belebey broken unbroken luck lucky well 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.430
 here is salt and it turns out 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.380
 man to furnish if he were such 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.660
 and she always had this on her back 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:13.000

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.670
