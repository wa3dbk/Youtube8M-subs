 Welcome over 1000 ps fans 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 here at the motorbike fair in dortmund 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.400
 I am now at the booth of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.139
 board the two wheel show respectively 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 toursieg stand with danijel peric hello 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.779
 You are a fast-paced marketing expert 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 For the sake of the two holding shop exactly 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 So I drive in the gsx-r challenge 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.490

 boards criminal second job marketing 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 internal things there , I can do that too 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 not because a child must get 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 or his wife though 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.870
 maybe sometimes there are little ones 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.649
 hearts as would fit in us 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 I wish you exactly three good luck 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.280
 but we are concerned with something else 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 another baby namely around this gsx r 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.730
 what kind of vehicle and where we are 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.219

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.149

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.190

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.290
 cooperation with fis one with the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.549
 modellbau fis man on his legs 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.600
 and that's why this is called 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 team viessmann brothers racing team 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 You are also in action or procedure 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.810
 in the background in the field I drive 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
 not myself I am in action and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.549
 take care of me a little bit yes 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.270
 marketing strategic directions and 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.229
 that is my job there but im 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.970
 active use come 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 You just told me your heart 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 beats for suzuki now have a few 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 other traders properly upgraded evil 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.689
 yamaha 1 and co 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.729
 with incredible electronics and there is 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 actually nothing in it there 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.479
 We've been saying that for a long time 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 why is it still such a good one? 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.990
 vehicle in racing yes klaus works 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 I like to visit already 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.829
 years together and that's why he has 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.939
 also in this context for the gsx 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.550
 r1000 decided 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.490
 Here it is to say that it is 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.470
 around a normal 1000 so 1000 gsx r 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.610
 but that is but with heart blood 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.440
 has been built 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.790
 Of course, klaus also uses it 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.260
 always the same partner as 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.250
 one stops also wonderful knows no one so 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.750
 pvp vmr osl and all the others 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.480
 Retailers always one 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.210
 play role and has been on the engine 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.750
 of course, the baby did a lot 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.510
 got so neat with some butter 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.820
 stuffed accordingly is there on one 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.070
 really fine tuning of dialogic 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.900
 So micro systems with power commander 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.150
 and all with one 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.740
 Prepared engine and I can one 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.950
 promise and indeed I believe that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.200
 ding the typical strong bmws or he 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.960
 so that will not be a long way off then 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.360
 There's a lot of bums behind, I think 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.780
 I still like to see some colorful ones 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.040
 buttons she stands right what it is 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.850
 what I suspect he is it is that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 system so from the yoshimura harness and 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.100
 everything that belongs to it and how far now 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.200
 the whole thing is that you can do it all 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.700
 Insert replica traction control 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.650
 you could still see that will be 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.390
 you still have to test because yes 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.920
 by default there are in this 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.260
 engines no traction control so 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.270
 not yet but now we have to look 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.340
 how far this system has matured 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.350
 So as I said you can clearly 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 became recognizable a bit yes fine 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.450
 it is noticed when it first starts first 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.090
 first use is the training 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.020
 of course now in front of hockenheim and 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.390
 then of course the 1000 kilometers 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.640
 bockenheim the highlight par excellence 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 where you still want to try yes as 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.560
 I wish to claim there too I wish 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.930
 you much success especially the klaus 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.880
 Of course, thank the team too 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.880
 thanks a lot and nice stay
