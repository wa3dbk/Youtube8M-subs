himself and I'm thinking that this might
be<00:00:56.489> quietly<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.270> year<00:00:57.750> where<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.899> finally<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.649> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
biggest factor you first have to look at

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
biggest factor you first have to look at
is<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> distance<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.820> can-can<00:01:03.480> American

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
against it even though the horse looks
so<00:01:52.170> dominant<00:01:52.740> last<00:01:53.159> time<00:01:53.399> anyone<00:01:53.790> Kentucky

Derby<00:01:54.810> before<00:01:55.560> taking<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> prequel<00:01:56.399> state

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Derby before taking the prequel state

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
Derby before taking the prequel state
yeah<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.299> mean<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> thing<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.200> he<00:01:58.380> didn't

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
yeah I mean the thing is that he didn't

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.100 
yeah I mean the thing is that he didn't
have<00:01:58.770> ideal<00:01:59.399> situations<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> Derby<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
have ideal situations for the Derby and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.359 
have ideal situations for the Derby and
the<00:02:01.200> Preakness<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.799> he<00:02:01.890> had<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.340> bad

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the Preakness right he had kind of a bad

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.639 
the Preakness right he had kind of a bad
draw<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.360> Derby<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.079> had<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> then

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
draw for the Derby that he had the then

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.260 
draw for the Derby that he had the then
he<00:02:04.740> had<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> rail<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> mud<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
he had the rail with the mud in the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
he had the rail with the mud in the
Preakness<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.590> kind<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.890> does<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
Preakness and so it kind of does that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
Preakness and so it kind of does that
not<00:02:08.610> speak<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> fact<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.509> might<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
not speak to the fact that he might be a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.600 
not speak to the fact that he might be a
gutsy<00:02:10.200> horse<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> pull<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.280> whatever

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
gutsy horse that can pull out whatever

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
gutsy horse that can pull out whatever
needs<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> pull<00:02:12.239> out<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> win<00:02:12.629> races<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:13.110> think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
needs to pull out to win races I think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
needs to pull out to win races I think
he

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
he

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.910 
he
gutsy<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.970> think<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.660> already<00:02:15.920> argument

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
gutsy but I think they already argument

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.460 
gutsy but I think they already argument
we<00:02:17.100> made<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.400> he<00:02:17.750> didn't<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> overcome

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
we made that he didn't have to overcome

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
we made that he didn't have to overcome
that<00:02:19.650> much<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.010> yeah<00:02:20.190> he<00:02:20.400> had<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> wide<00:02:20.880> post<00:02:21.330> out

there's no harmed acknowledging that and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
then at the same time think well it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.430 
then at the same time think well it
doesn't<00:03:23.940> necessarily<00:03:24.000> mean<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.690> he's<00:03:25.260> going

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440

similar circumstance California chrome

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.910 
similar circumstance California chrome
was<00:03:32.940> much<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.420> best<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.080> Derby<00:03:34.530> he

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
was much the best in the Derby he

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.370 
was much the best in the Derby he
dominated<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.820> Preakness<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.480> he<00:03:36.990> was

dominated the Preakness and he was

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.070 
dominated the Preakness and he was

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
unable to win the Belmont I think that a

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.140 
unable to win the Belmont I think that a
American<00:03:40.800> Pharoah<00:03:41.010> maybe<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.520> little<00:03:41.760> bit<00:03:41.970> more

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
American Pharoah maybe a little bit more

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.970 
American Pharoah maybe a little bit more

really than California chrome but I
still<00:03:46.890> don't<00:03:47.040> think<00:03:47.160> he's<00:03:47.400> gonna<00:03:47.550> win<00:03:47.850> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120

caught your eye well the positive thing
is<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.750> think<00:03:58.020> he<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.380> mean<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.250> things

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
is I think he I mean you know things

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.100 
is I think he I mean you know things
energy<00:03:59.940> should<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.120> relatively<00:04:00.660> fresh

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
energy should be relatively fresh

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.110 
energy should be relatively fresh
because<00:04:01.440> he<00:04:01.740> I<00:04:01.950> don't<00:04:02.550> think<00:04:02.670> he<00:04:02.730> had<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.940> work

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
because he I don't think he had to work

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.880 
because he I don't think he had to work
that<00:04:03.390> hard<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.959> other<00:04:04.170> one<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.500> his<00:04:04.620> races

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
that hard in other one of his races

that hard in other one of his races
relatively<00:04:05.820> speaking<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:07.709> know<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:07.890> his

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
relatively speaking you know I his

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
relatively speaking you know I his
talent<00:04:08.790> level<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.180> fine<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.420> think<00:04:09.780> he's<00:04:09.870> going

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
talent level is fine I think he's going

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.780 
talent level is fine I think he's going
to<00:04:10.080> come<00:04:10.200> into<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.470> race<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.890> good<00:04:11.070> shape<00:04:11.100> but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
to come into the race in good shape but

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.729 
to come into the race in good shape but
the<00:04:11.850> negatives<00:04:12.390> are<00:04:12.600> he's<00:04:13.230> gonna<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.500> running

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the negatives are he's gonna be running

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.890 
the negatives are he's gonna be running
into<00:04:14.010> two<00:04:14.250> horses<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.940> think<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.300> horses<00:04:15.750> that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
into two horses I think that horses that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.900 
into two horses I think that horses that
ran<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.620> better<00:04:16.799> races<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> Kentucky
