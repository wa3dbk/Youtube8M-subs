00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 today gets to a new video and 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.880
 Although on new protex video and indeed goes 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.590
 put it on and around in game settings today 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.240
 asked yes what fox which 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.480
 sensitivity do you care which 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.270
 brightness and the stars and hold me 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.630
 the times with you were consistent 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.489
 directly to 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.570
 it was rose occupancy standard I have 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.330
 Never changed the controller allocation 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.340
 tactic game already in 2004 simple 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.520
 simple reason that you just directly 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.660
 drop scots can just do a lot of things 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.810
 much easier to the next point of view 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.430
 reversal I have no situation 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.430
 I was also deactivated that there 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.869
 disturbs if you only when you shoot 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.549
 just bothers with the next point 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.619
 and that's the point where the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.530
 Most people think that's wrong 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.060
 I also do my colleagues and too 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.460
 speech 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.590
 those on cd always gamble on somehow 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 everybody pulls and rcb something from 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.729
 war god some 36 what I know 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.280
 and there is the error because the most 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 I have to give links or the amateurs 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.490
 do this and that is the mistake 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.049
 because if you're really good ethno 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.659
 LÃ¶tzsch then comes 99 percent of 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.220
 no opponent falls behind 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.540
 and there you will be and you were too 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.090
 you are more interested in a competitive one 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.380
 have strong aiming and do you have one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.360
 stronger Emming if you is to go and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.840
 I would recommend to three to five too 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.729
 do not play higher and I lower 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.590
 then this simply recommends aiming 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.660
 have long range 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.230
 officer so much better goals 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.709
 If I am here now, it was 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.180
 wannabe mainland klitschko stays 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.180
 do you want because you want one because 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 which is now one blows so 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.750
 that is not completely forgotten has the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.299
 points make most people wrong 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.830
 think oh sensitivity equal yes me 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.810
 give them turner and nobody can 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:40.470
 kill me 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:42.540
 but first of all point and that here 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.290
 bring too tolerant and vertical country 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.110
 I'm right in the middle 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.590
 that has a simple reason that we 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.110
 Rather , the minimap is in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.359
 the middle of that has the reason that me 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.340
 everything closer to that in the middle has that 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.910
 If I left, for example, on 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.650
 the radar notes then that much 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.930
 faster than if it's at the top left 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.299
 In addition, I can access the minimap 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.420
 look and still have in mine 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:20.180
 view what's happening in front of me 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.180
 now when I'm doing that at all 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.299
 you can already see my eye has one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.620
 much further away to the top left where you 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.030
 Now I have to look to the upper left 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.659
 that in the middle not so much in view 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.129
 if everything is centered so must 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.469
 I look at the minimap and I even know 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.739
 not really what happens in front of me 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:50.299
 that's why people in the middle with nice 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:51.189
 the fucking belongs to the next 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.480
 Point 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.549
 According to Steiger I have the very top 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.650
 unfortunately you can through many things 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.189
 to adjust 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.169
 have with ghost eg black ops honesty 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.819
 I go all the way up 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.730
 also better on the people of course 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.859
 looks at dark places 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.049
 and I also think that yes I think so 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.819
 that you can see the outlines of the ehc clips and 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.000
 even better you can see on high 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.650
 brightness plays but that is 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.620
 maybe only colorblind mode 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.479
 I only had mp3 enabled on mp3 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 you could see the names of the opponents 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.220
 naturally through walls so see 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.220
 little brook bmw that we are here now 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.650
 one was so hectic and me here 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.780
 already come from me but I am already 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.300
 because the name has seen the tag office 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:51.430
 now changed because of that drive band 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.430
 You no longer have to activate the mode 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.030
 then most people forgot or 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.030
 not note here once with 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.139
 play before settings in general here 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.809
 is definitely important she is on 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:19.020
 low plays because it gives you one 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:25.589
 schmied tear aiming i say so if 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:28.169
 I play on high then that is really 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.099
 the smallest movement when boarding though 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.240
 I go upstairs 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:35.819
 right to the top really smallest 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.819
 movement and not being so sudden 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.779
 may be with the other logistics is 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:51.889
 Definitely important to me here 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:58.819
 floss plays presets for four 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.819
 games presets venice plays 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.920
 he does not pull your thing that way 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.110
 really so if you go to the left 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.420
 then it really goes left in 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.600
 a straight line but in the on high 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.190
 there it goes so up - 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.740
 a little bit the stick after 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:23.540
 on the top left shift and even really 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.150
 just so that it was 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.190
 actually I hope you have that 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.300
 Video driven that was helpful though 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.840
 Maybe I was over 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.150
 a thumb tall 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.660
 and yes, until the next percent 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.660
 new key
