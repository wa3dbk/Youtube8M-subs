again<00:01:09.439> after<00:01:10.439> i<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> lenient<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> he

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
again after i do my lenient right and he

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.870 
again after i do my lenient right and he
takes<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> town<00:01:14.820> hall<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.880> I

here<00:04:05.150> no<00:04:06.150> not<00:04:06.540> really<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.880> doesn't

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
here no not really because that doesn't

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.460 
here no not really because that doesn't
even<00:04:09.150> make<00:04:09.390> sense<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:11.519> makes<00:04:11.820> no<00:04:12.180> sense

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
even make sense that it makes no sense

yeah<00:04:17.910> good<00:04:18.750> idea<00:04:19.669> but<00:04:20.669> moving<00:04:21.330> on<00:04:21.950> soon<00:04:22.950> I

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
yeah good idea but moving on soon I

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.680 
yeah good idea but moving on soon I
think<00:04:24.840> that's<00:04:25.140> it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
think that's it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.740 
think that's it
i<00:04:25.750> don't<00:04:26.560> know<00:04:26.620> how<00:04:26.830> many<00:04:26.890> i<00:04:27.160> did<00:04:27.460> they<00:04:28.450> will<00:04:28.660> do

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
i don't know how many i did they will do

to<00:04:44.970> like<00:04:45.970> kind<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.540> like<00:04:46.600> lunians<00:04:47.200> like<00:04:47.890> get

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
to like kind of like lunians like get

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.710 
to like kind of like lunians like get
all<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:49.530> all<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:51.520> defenses<00:04:52.480> on<00:04:52.630> the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
all of the all of the defenses on the

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.350 
all of the all of the defenses on the
side<00:04:52.930> like<00:04:53.200> taking<00:04:53.560> out<00:04:54.060> except<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.120> didn't<00:04:55.300> do

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
side like taking out except I didn't do

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.270 
side like taking out except I didn't do
this<00:04:55.390> very<00:04:55.630> well<00:04:55.750> but<00:04:56.170> here's<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.890> heroes

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
this very well but here's the heroes

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.680 
this very well but here's the heroes
like<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:57.580> those<00:04:57.760> heroes<00:04:58.090> weren't<00:04:58.330> there<00:04:58.480> I

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
like if those heroes weren't there I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.480 
like if those heroes weren't there I
think<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.080> could<00:04:59.140> have<00:04:59.350> done<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.530> but<00:04:59.920> lower

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
think I could have done this but lower

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.620 
think I could have done this but lower
40<00:05:00.880> heroes<00:05:01.180> are<00:05:01.300> just<00:05:01.330> boss<00:05:01.780> so<00:05:02.590> they<00:05:03.040> tear<00:05:03.310> up

hogs Aloha for or I need to do that
maybe<00:05:41.560> try<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:41.890> again<00:05:42.130> later<00:05:42.520> what<00:05:43.240> kind<00:05:43.360> of

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
maybe try this again later what kind of

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.440 
maybe try this again later what kind of
little<00:05:43.630> for<00:05:43.810> hog<00:05:44.020> ease<00:05:44.230> and<00:05:45.090> every<00:05:46.090> better

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
little for hog ease and every better

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.170 
little for hog ease and every better
healing<00:05:46.720> spells<00:05:47.050> too<00:05:47.230> but<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> plan<00:05:48.070> was<00:05:48.280> to

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
healing spells too but the plan was to

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.840 
healing spells too but the plan was to
just<00:05:49.210> go<00:05:49.480> around<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.870> base<00:05:50.080> is<00:05:50.350> my<00:05:51.100> other<00:05:51.370> plan

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
just go around the base is my other plan

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.790 
just go around the base is my other plan
and<00:05:52.120> might<00:05:52.360> get<00:05:52.630> out<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.930> fences<00:05:53.320> like<00:05:53.530> five

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
and might get out the fences like five

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.640 
and might get out the fences like five
hogs<00:05:54.070> at<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.250> time<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.840> then<00:05:55.900> come<00:05:56.260> around<00:05:56.470> with

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
hogs at a time and then come around with

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.409 
hogs at a time and then come around with
archers<00:05:57.250> or<00:05:57.430> something<00:05:57.790> and<00:05:57.970> get<00:05:58.150> the

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
archers or something and get the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.150 
archers or something and get the
percentage<00:05:58.960> kind<00:05:59.260> of<00:05:59.320> like<00:05:59.470> losing<00:05:59.710> millions

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
percentage kind of like losing millions

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.940 
percentage kind of like losing millions
but<00:06:00.610> with<00:06:00.760> hogs<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.270> archers<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:01.810> think<00:06:02.650> you

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
but with hogs and archers I think you

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.820 
but with hogs and archers I think you
know<00:06:03.010> it's<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.910> try<00:06:04.540> okay<00:06:05.169> I've<00:06:05.500> never<00:06:05.680> seen

all either and that's probably what you

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.400 
all either and that's probably what you
should<00:06:28.090> use<00:06:28.240> hogs<00:06:28.480> for<00:06:28.750> actually<00:06:29.140> it's<00:06:29.260> what<00:06:29.380> I

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
should use hogs for actually it's what I

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.950 
should use hogs for actually it's what I
should<00:06:29.560> have<00:06:29.590> done<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.950> should<00:06:30.160> have<00:06:30.280> just<00:06:30.310> like

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
should have done I should have just like

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.480 
should have done I should have just like
percentage<00:06:31.960> around<00:06:32.290> or<00:06:32.919> tried<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.340> do<00:06:33.460> that

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
percentage around or tried to do that

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.070 
percentage around or tried to do that
instead<00:06:34.419> I<00:06:34.450> don't<00:06:34.660> know<00:06:34.720> what<00:06:34.840> I<00:06:34.870> was<00:06:35.020> thinking

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080
