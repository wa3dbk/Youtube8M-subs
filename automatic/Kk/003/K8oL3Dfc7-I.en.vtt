00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.360
 tax evasion 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.220
 the money that is equivalent to the product 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.439
 gross domestic area of ​​the USA and Japan in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.779
 whole countries as intended 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.090
 Switzerland or the Cayman Islands that have 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.980

 help from private banks the report 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.449

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.800
 they took advantage of the fiscal loopholes 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.930

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.960
 moriche this speculation of the elites 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.920
 will be reflected in the taxes that 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.930
 must pay the taxpayers 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.210
 currents 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.300
 the consequences are enormously serious 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.870
 because that volume of money should 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 produce should have generated something more 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.290

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.619
 fraud covered by the inaction of 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.649
 political power but this is a great 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.660
 tax fraud what generates is the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.009
 destruction of public services 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.170
 who offer their benefits to the class 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:35.120

 because there is a huge immense amount 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.610
 of deposits that have to do with 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 criminal activities in the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.530
