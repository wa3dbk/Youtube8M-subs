competition some competitions do give
away<00:00:39.360> things<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.379> them

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
away things and that's just one of them

away things and that's just one of them
it's<00:00:40.710> something<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.430> probably

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it's something like this would probably

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's something like this would probably
be<00:00:41.760> too<00:00:41.940> small<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
be too small if you can see the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.889 
be too small if you can see the
difference<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.510> pretty<00:00:45.840> much

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
difference in them but pretty much

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
difference in them but pretty much
