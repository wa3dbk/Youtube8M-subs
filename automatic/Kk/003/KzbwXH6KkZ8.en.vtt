 tissues the cause is 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.570
 autologous that means we get the

 cells of the patient himself commonly 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.160

 vouchers that can be treated today 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.049
 diseases are diverse

 to hardware all rheumatic masses 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.670
 extraordinarily good 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.500
 however this specialist with 12 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.080
 years of experience in the field of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.210
 stem cells recognizes that the technique does not 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.160
 represents a definitive cure for 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 diseases but an improvement 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.870
 remarkable in health the reality we are 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.460
 watching the tip of the green des swim without 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.980
 But of course this is going to open 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.480
 doors roads ideas and many more things 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.740
 to exploit in terms of treatment 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.540

 and in this Mexico is the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.480
 front in the investigations which 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.770
 they are becoming the medicine of 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.870
 future we have the advantage that Mexico 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:17.310
 we can perform the treatment in the usa 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.310
 it can not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 this other specialist doctor in 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 neurobiology works at costa mesa 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.530
 california but recognizes that in mexico 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 the level of practice in that area is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.120
 elevated however recommended to take 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.370
 precautions are things that you have to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 investigate well what they are

 doing the doctors that are doing 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.630
 the groups with whom you are working

 these are the things that oneself that is 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.540
 plan to do something like that a treatment if 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.180
 have to find out 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.790
 However, the current challenge is to discover 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.099
 more benefits and prolong the life of the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.409
 human being although it does not look like 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.629
 the fountain of eternal youth many 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.519
 they say that he approaches her for that reason the 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.519
 consider the great hope
