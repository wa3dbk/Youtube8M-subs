back of the hock and around the back of
the<00:01:47.530> hamstring<00:01:47.709> and<00:01:48.159> I'll<00:01:48.280> pull<00:01:48.459> it<00:01:48.490> up

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the hamstring and I'll pull it up

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.819 
the hamstring and I'll pull it up
through<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.299> attach<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.810> zipper<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.469> the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.970 

and<00:02:06.050> we<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:06.230> simply<00:02:06.380> go<00:02:06.650> around<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.920> other

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
and we just simply go around the other

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.260 
and we just simply go around the other
side<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.370> horse<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.670> do<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.850> same<00:02:08.030> thing

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
side of the horse and do the same thing

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.280

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
hamstring the more we go out together

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.940
