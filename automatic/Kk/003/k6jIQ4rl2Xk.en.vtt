00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
now the reason I brought up this other

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.649 
now the reason I brought up this other
root<00:03:30.989> note<00:03:31.200> before<00:03:32.120> cuz<00:03:33.120> there's<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> first

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
root note before cuz there's the first

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.830 
root note before cuz there's the first
part<00:03:33.959> right<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:35.269> but<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.450> had<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.569> root

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
part right here but if you had the root

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.259 
part right here but if you had the root
note<00:03:39.860> because<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.489> sounds<00:03:42.030> kind<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
note because this also sounds kind of

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.839 
note because this also sounds kind of
interesting<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.049> sometimes<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.159> in<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
interesting and sometimes in the in the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.490 
interesting and sometimes in the in the
live<00:03:45.090> versions<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.629> hard<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.019> really<00:03:46.170> hear

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
live versions it's hard to really hear

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800 
live versions it's hard to really hear
the<00:03:46.650> exact<00:03:46.920> tone<00:03:47.159> but<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.180> could<00:03:48.480> put<00:03:48.659> your

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
the exact tone but you could put your

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.830 
the exact tone but you could put your
first<00:03:49.019> finger<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:51.269> note<00:03:51.480> which<00:03:51.690> is

in parallel yeah so you're going to stay
in<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:20.590> original<00:05:20.980> preset<00:05:21.610> for<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.850> main

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
in that original preset for the main

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.920 
in that original preset for the main
course<00:05:22.030> riff

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.970 

and<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.020> course<00:05:31.080> here's<00:05:31.500> what<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.680> sounds<00:05:31.949> like

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
and of course here's what it sounds like

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.730 
and of course here's what it sounds like
the<00:05:32.190> other<00:05:32.340> way

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.130 

very<00:05:40.740> subtle<00:05:40.980> difference<00:05:41.520> but<00:05:41.730> again<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.300> like

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
very subtle difference but again I like

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:52.850 
very subtle difference but again I like
it<00:05:43.320> this<00:05:43.440> way<00:05:43.620> again<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:51.690> I'm<00:05:52.080> doing<00:05:52.350> all<00:05:52.620> down

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
it this way again and I'm doing all down

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.850 
it this way again and I'm doing all down
strokes<00:05:53.040> there<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:54.570> now<00:05:55.200> we've<00:05:55.440> done<00:05:55.680> the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
strokes there so now we've done the

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.520 
strokes there so now we've done the
transition
