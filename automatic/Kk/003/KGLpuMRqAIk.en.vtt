00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.129
 sow 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.219
 m 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.660
 losc to his father 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.529
 and it's hamza mme welcome from this 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.480
 tutorial lesson to learn the famous 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.810
 pink floyd song we wish you were 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.939
 here 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.140
 and there we do in the classic 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.030
 but it's still a must 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.129
 for the guitar and I will propose 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.270
 to learn everything nicely the first 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.850
 thing is that you can go on my 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.230
 blog download the score so this is 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.180
 just the lyrics with the chords 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.460
 marked on it and that you will be able to use 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.920
 to follow the progress of the agreement 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 so we'll start by deconstructing the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.730
 rhythm with the right hand on an agreement 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.360
 of alone so if you want with the hand 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.729
 right it makes it plays on the 1 3 m and 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 so that's a measure so if I 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:07.350
 do it slowly, it's 1 and 2 and 3 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.350
 and 4 and 2 3 etc 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350
 and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.780
 who are you 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 white is ok I hope you do not follow 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.270
 until now sometimes you will see that he supports 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.270
 once that also scratches the time 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.600
 number 4 so that's it for the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600
 pace 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.820
 ok then the chords they go 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.870
 appear here are you probably 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.940
 on your little card 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.760
 so what does it propose to you to do these two 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.560
 measures of single in introduction then 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.270
 to make the first agreements without 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.690
 to sing but so that you can 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.370
 to follow 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.380
 and when you'll be good to play like that 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.660
 you will practice singing with around the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.800
 fire or shower 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.250
 ok we start with both measures 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 the introduction of soil agree 3 4 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 1 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.620
 we do it again once you noticed that 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.120
 I played it round little back 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.769
 differently but I apologize for not 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.030
 expressly makes old reflexes to 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.819
 eradicate from my head 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.680
 in fact once two measurements of soil do 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:39.459
 the minor and only 1 2 3 4 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.459
 only 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.610
 ok we made the start of the song the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.900
 end of the song is almost all time 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.670
 the same thing you just have to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.860
 what agreement and what words to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.130
 pretty much and then you'll learn how to 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.200
 singing it starts as a god of 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.730
 incredible psychedelic is going on 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.750
 in the head 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.780
 there is just one more specialty 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.120
 I can you carried on agreement 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.650
 hey that you can play with a base 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.950
 of fans diez that is to say instead of 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.610
 drop like that by playing tk 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.190
 last rope 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.810
 you go with your thumb pressed on your 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.210
 Strawberry the second tap of Tape 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.210
 first string that gives this note there 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.450
 which is a fan base diez and then 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.129
 with the tuna meat thumbs you go 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.750
 come up against your second rope or 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.610
 stifled your second body ie 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.310
 that you are going to make a break of F sharp 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 goals and this one and make the ring again 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.629
 badly and that that makes you feel pretty 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.879
 nice that sounds pretty pink floyd ok 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.109
