Sony has a demo at GDC 2014 of eye
tracking<00:00:11.910> technology<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.170> we're<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
tracking technology and we're about to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.970 
tracking technology and we're about to
calibrate<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> right<00:00:14.280> now<00:00:14.429> let's<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.089> ahead

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
calibrate it right now let's go ahead

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.349 
calibrate it right now let's go ahead
about<00:00:16.980> 60<00:00:17.490> centimeters<00:00:17.910> away<00:00:18.060> from<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
two dots and this sensor bar in front of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
two dots and this sensor bar in front of
me<00:00:22.590> knows<00:00:22.859> where<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.220> eyes<00:00:23.400> are<00:00:23.430> where<00:00:24.060> I'm

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
me knows where my eyes are where I'm

me knows where my eyes are where I'm
looking<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.750> its<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.320> gaze<00:00:25.529> tracking<00:00:25.859> system

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
looking at its a gaze tracking system

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
looking at its a gaze tracking system
and<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:27.150> you'll<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.599> moment<00:00:27.720> we'll<00:00:28.019> jump

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just gonna look for the top of the Space

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.090 
just gonna look for the top of the Space
Needle<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.570> it's<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.350> stops<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.920> soon

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
Needle and it's there it stops as soon

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
Needle and it's there it stops as soon
as<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.460> soon<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:44.940> there<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:46.050> knows

as as soon as I get there it knows

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
as as soon as I get there it knows
that's<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> stops

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
controller in front of me I just look at

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.450 
controller in front of me I just look at
something<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.960> goes<00:01:04.110> thing<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.250> I'm

something and it goes thing so now I'm
playing<00:01:05.780> an<00:01:06.780> actual<00:01:07.260> part<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.920> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
playing an actual part of the game I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
playing an actual part of the game I'm
just<00:01:08.130> running<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.030> environment<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
just running around this environment I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
just running around this environment I
can<00:01:10.260> throw<00:01:10.530> fireballs<00:01:11.090> previously<00:01:12.090> I'd<00:01:12.210> have

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
can throw fireballs previously I'd have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330 
can throw fireballs previously I'd have
to<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:13.200> analog<00:01:13.590> stick<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to use this right analog stick to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.539 
to use this right analog stick to
carefully<00:01:14.970> aim<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.549> maybe

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
carefully aim where I want to go maybe

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
carefully aim where I want to go maybe
even<00:01:17.850> I'd<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> stop<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.630> tracks<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
even I'd have to stop in my tracks if I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
even I'd have to stop in my tracks if I
wanted<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> able<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> accurately<00:01:20.580> aim<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
wanted to be able to accurately aim a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
wanted to be able to accurately aim a
fireball<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.930> fireballs<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.860> wherever<00:01:23.159> I'm

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
fireball now fireballs go wherever I'm

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.690 
fireball now fireballs go wherever I'm
looking<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.430> combat<00:01:26.430> scenario

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
looking now I'm in a combat scenario

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.289 
looking now I'm in a combat scenario
I've<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.860> some<00:01:28.860> guards<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:30.210> your

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
I've got some some guards here for your

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
I've got some some guards here for your
baby<00:01:30.450> patrolling<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:30.990> submachine<00:01:31.350> guns

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
baby patrolling with submachine guns

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
baby patrolling with submachine guns
normally<00:01:32.549> I'd<00:01:32.640> probably<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> stop<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
normally I'd probably have to stop and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
normally I'd probably have to stop and
or<00:01:34.229> maybe<00:01:34.350> enter<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> bullet<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.400> mode

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
or maybe enter like a bullet time mode

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
or maybe enter like a bullet time mode
and<00:01:36.030> shoot<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.350> just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and shoot at them but here I can just

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
and shoot at them but here I can just
dance<00:01:37.860> around<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.320> looking<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.799> these

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
dance around so just looking at these

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969 
dance around so just looking at these
folks<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.270> run<00:01:42.450> towards<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.770> run<00:01:43.890> away

from<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.149> keep<00:01:45.299> tapping<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:46.439> shooting

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
from them to keep tapping just shooting

from them to keep tapping just shooting
wherever<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.689> however<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.049> wherever

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I think I want to hit something out

comes<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.350> fireball<00:01:53.090> works<00:01:54.090> particularly<00:01:54.479> well

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
comes a fireball works particularly well

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420 
comes a fireball works particularly well
when<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.049> running<00:01:55.170> away<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.770> target<00:01:55.950> too

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
when I'm running away from a target too

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
when I'm running away from a target too
which<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> something<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.479> completely

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
which is something that's completely

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.499 
which is something that's completely
counterintuitive<00:01:58.770> normally<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.210> something

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
counterintuitive normally but something

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.429 
counterintuitive normally but something
that<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.659> guess<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> superhero<00:02:01.350> would

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that I guess the superhero would

that I guess the superhero would
probably<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.829> able<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> do

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
probably be able to do
