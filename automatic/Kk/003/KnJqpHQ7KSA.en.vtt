 just makes you constantly something 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.440

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.040
 there is so much that nowhere to plant your ass 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 will be and you know why there is so much 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.570
 think so important to build a bunch of garbage 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.900
 the name that you hear for the first time here 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.660
 boathouse says something an hour that's all 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.620

 OPANA all upset at once but hold on 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.359
 pocket wider there is still a lot to plump

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.769
 settled it's time to let the mountains 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.609
 do this pirate business will 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.640
 rob if someone thinks that it there could be 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.640
 waiting for epic tactical battles then let 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.700
 the second time she will shut her ass mitten 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.430
 2 you will be given here a classic sent 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.070
 somewhere someone gave those to someone 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.100
 or themselves grabbed and you only reports 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.690
 come supposedly so much so much 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.480
 ingloriously died trying to plunder 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.549
 million and you on the drum you this 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.550
 Battle and not seen and not on your hands 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.489
 the death of a soldier is a scoundrel random so 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.530
 decided to bury your warriors at all when 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.959
 you open the map to the world 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.030
 familiar picture to everyone a different 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.879
 islets of others like you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.409
 dickheads that loot nowhere to go well 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.900
 these are the ones that are upset 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.810
 and those that burn never belonged 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.970
 people are poorer who came here 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.650
 looked realized and piled want 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.770
 say that they were not only poorer 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.870
 well , and remember, and you ask me what 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.419
 this game is different from others why 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.580
 all crabs from their browser strings i 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.159
 I want to send here yes because this 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.080
 the game is at least traced normally even 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.580
 woman in the beginning beats training 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.620
 interesting things are not text a 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.659
 voice because despite 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.610
 the multiplicity of the building they perform 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.919
 its unique role these crabs though 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.110
 learn the historical name for what 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.840
 what was applied yes because here 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.240
 adequate system invention improvements 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.760
 only you and only you decide which army 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.860
 you need or even bolt to score on 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.680
 war and do trade politics yes 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.510
 there is even politics here and I am not saying that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.960
 this is a cool game as already noted 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.080
 gash and forget but it is much better than hundreds 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.470
 she is like as they say from two evils and 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.500
 if and only if you like such 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.550
 building then pay attention to others 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.760
 go past the forest and don't get into it 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.310
 swamp 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.180
 all brother 2 island built in battle 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.520
 We grabbed all about losing Valim where else 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.680
 you can be more interesting there soon 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.310
 see you fuck knows where me 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.310
 will bring
