on<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> new<00:01:52.170> palm<00:01:52.950> leak<00:01:53.509> well<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
on this new palm leak well I think it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.060 
on this new palm leak well I think it
was<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> those<00:01:55.200> things<00:01:55.380> were<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> CES

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
was one of those things were at the CES

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
was one of those things were at the CES
launch<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:57.030> were<00:01:57.210> said<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:57.840> were

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
launch they were said that they were

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
launch they were said that they were
hoping<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> webos<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
hoping the webos was going to be a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
hoping the webos was going to be a
platform<00:02:00.090> rather<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.770> single

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
platform rather than just a single

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.399 
platform rather than just a single
device<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> iPhone<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.780> think

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
device very much like the iPhone I think

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.139 
device very much like the iPhone I think
it's<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.770> aiming<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> younger<00:02:05.759> youth

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's probably aiming at a younger youth

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.180 
it's probably aiming at a younger youth
market<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.899> already<00:02:07.140> saw<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> moles<00:02:07.829> show

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
market you already saw the moles show

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.230 
market you already saw the moles show
for<00:02:08.459> example<00:02:09.800> waxing<00:02:10.800> lyrically<00:02:11.340> about<00:02:11.340> how

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
for example waxing lyrically about how

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000 
for example waxing lyrically about how
you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.780> palm<00:02:13.020> pre<00:02:13.380> was<00:02:13.710> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> be

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you know the palm pre was going to be

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.370 
you know the palm pre was going to be
the<00:02:14.190> thing<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.880> kids<00:02:15.150> earlier<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.200> week

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the thing for the kids earlier this week

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.960 
the thing for the kids earlier this week
and<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.860> probably<00:02:17.100> following<00:02:17.820> those

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and this is probably following those

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.150 
and this is probably following those
central<00:02:18.480> lines<00:02:18.690> more<00:02:18.960> probably<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> palm<00:02:19.650> pre

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
central lines more probably a palm pre

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.610 
central lines more probably a palm pre
probably<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.120> treo<00:02:21.420> pro<00:02:21.510> sort<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> lines

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
probably the treo pro sort of lines

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
probably the treo pro sort of lines
worse<00:02:22.890> well<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.790> don't<00:02:23.910> necessarily<00:02:24.390> like

manufacturer yeah which is a completely

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.830 
manufacturer yeah which is a completely
another<00:04:40.400> story<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.120> mean<00:04:41.300> there's<00:04:41.449> lots<00:04:41.630> of

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
another story but I mean there's lots of

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.629 
another story but I mean there's lots of
them<00:04:42.350> around<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.919> think<00:04:43.130> why<00:04:43.280> they're<00:04:43.490> so

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
them around I think why they're so

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.120 
them around I think why they're so
successful<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.300> although<00:04:45.110> most<00:04:45.560> mobile

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
successful is that although most mobile

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.460 
successful is that although most mobile
phones<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.820> do<00:04:47.030> video<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.199> seems<00:04:48.380> that

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
phones can do video and it seems that

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.230 
phones can do video and it seems that
even<00:04:48.590> if<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.100> specs<00:04:49.460> are<00:04:49.580> right<00:04:49.729> with<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.910> palm

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
even if the specs are right with a palm

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.260 
even if the specs are right with a palm
yeaah<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.350> they<00:04:51.470> can<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.740> can<00:04:51.889> do<00:04:52.010> h.264<00:04:52.970> as<00:04:53.120> well

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
yeaah so they can I can do h.264 as well

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.719 
yeaah so they can I can do h.264 as well
but<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.110> think<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.740> makes<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.250> easier

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
but it's I think it just makes it easier

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.000 
but it's I think it just makes it easier
you<00:04:55.880> know<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.060> ability<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.570> sort<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:57.010> unplug

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
you know the ability to sort of unplug

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.770 
you know the ability to sort of unplug
something<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.639> know<00:04:58.729> take<00:04:59.090> some<00:04:59.270> video<00:04:59.389> just

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
something you know take some video just

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.080 
something you know take some video just
plug<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.050> straight<00:05:00.139> in<00:05:00.440> by<00:05:00.560> USB<00:05:00.919> or<00:05:01.250> via<00:05:01.460> HDMI

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
plug it straight in by USB or via HDMI

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.390 
plug it straight in by USB or via HDMI
as<00:05:02.720> we're<00:05:02.900> starting<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.229> see<00:05:03.289> already<00:05:03.800> just

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
as we're starting to see already just

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.490 
as we're starting to see already just
seems<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.729> make<00:05:04.820> more<00:05:04.880> sense<00:05:05.380> what's<00:05:06.380> your

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
seems to make more sense what's your

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.050 
seems to make more sense what's your
take<00:05:06.710> Brian<00:05:06.949> um<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.430> know<00:05:07.520> this<00:05:07.669> is<00:05:07.699> kind<00:05:08.030> of

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
take Brian um you know this is kind of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.000 
take Brian um you know this is kind of
an<00:05:08.180> upgrade<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.930> previous<00:05:09.320> flip<00:05:09.620> cameras

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
an upgrade to the previous flip cameras

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.860 
an upgrade to the previous flip cameras
do<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.610> think<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:10.940> this<00:05:11.240> has<00:05:11.449> a<00:05:11.479> little<00:05:11.690> bit

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
do you think that this has a little bit

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.210 
do you think that this has a little bit
higher<00:05:12.020> price<00:05:12.350> tag<00:05:12.620> than<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.889> other<00:05:13.010> ones

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
higher price tag than the other ones

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.710 
higher price tag than the other ones
have<00:05:13.370> had<00:05:13.490> in<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.639> past<00:05:13.729> do<00:05:14.419> you<00:05:14.479> think<00:05:14.600> that

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
have had in the past do you think that

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.090 
have had in the past do you think that
higher<00:05:14.930> price<00:05:15.229> tag<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.500> maybe<00:05:15.770> something<00:05:16.010> that

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
higher price tag is maybe something that

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.200 
higher price tag is maybe something that
turns<00:05:16.250> people<00:05:16.340> off<00:05:16.639> or<00:05:16.850> do<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:16.970> think<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.180> is

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
turns people off or do you think this is

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.580 
turns people off or do you think this is
still<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:18.020> know<00:05:18.110> one<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> best

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
still you know one of the best

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.040 
still you know one of the best
camcorders<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.250> could<00:05:19.400> pick<00:05:19.580> up<00:05:19.610> well<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:20.600> mean

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
camcorders you could pick up well I mean

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.050 
camcorders you could pick up well I mean
it's<00:05:21.199> interesting<00:05:21.380> because<00:05:21.740> that's<00:05:22.070> kind<00:05:23.000> of

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
it's interesting because that's kind of

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600 
it's interesting because that's kind of
half<00:05:23.419> true<00:05:23.720> it's<00:05:24.410> it's<00:05:24.740> got<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> higher<00:05:25.370> price

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
half true it's it's got a higher price

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.760 
half true it's it's got a higher price
tag<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.240> it's<00:05:26.479> got<00:05:26.630> HD<00:05:27.050> which<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.560> original

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
tag and it's got HD which the original

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.279 
tag and it's got HD which the original
flip<00:05:28.220> ultra<00:05:28.460> didn't<00:05:28.639> have<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.300> subsequently

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
flip ultra didn't have but subsequently

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.260 
flip ultra didn't have but subsequently
well<00:05:30.830> between<00:05:31.099> those<00:05:31.490> two<00:05:31.610> releases<00:05:32.030> they

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
well between those two releases they

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.300 
well between those two releases they
came<00:05:32.450> out<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.960> flip<00:05:33.200> meadow<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.130> flip

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
came out the flip meadow and the flip

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.250 
came out the flip meadow and the flip
mino<00:05:34.490> HD<00:05:34.520> which<00:05:35.060> was<00:05:35.180> their<00:05:35.360> first<00:05:35.599> HD

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
mino HD which was their first HD

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.100 
mino HD which was their first HD
camcorder<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.639> flip<00:05:38.180> mino<00:05:38.360> HD<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.690> think

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
camcorder the a flip mino HD I think

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.210 
camcorder the a flip mino HD I think
costs<00:05:39.530> about<00:05:39.820> 229<00:05:40.820> street<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:41.690> one's<00:05:41.930> 199<00:05:42.710> so

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
costs about 229 street this one's 199 so

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.560 
costs about 229 street this one's 199 so
it's<00:05:43.310> about<00:05:43.400> thirty<00:05:43.639> dollars<00:05:43.940> less<00:05:44.150> it's<00:05:44.389> also

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
it's about thirty dollars less it's also

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.159 
it's about thirty dollars less it's also
got<00:05:44.840> less<00:05:45.260> features<00:05:45.500> it's<00:05:45.889> about<00:05:46.370> as<00:05:47.169> simple

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
got less features it's about as simple

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.500 
got less features it's about as simple
as<00:05:48.380> an<00:05:48.800> HD<00:05:49.190> camcorder<00:05:49.430> possibly<00:05:50.180> could<00:05:50.360> be

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
as an HD camcorder possibly could be

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.290 
as an HD camcorder possibly could be
because<00:05:50.690> you<00:05:50.900> can't<00:05:51.139> even<00:05:51.260> shoot<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:51.680> VGA<00:05:52.010> mode

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
because you can't even shoot in VGA mode

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300 
because you can't even shoot in VGA mode
if<00:05:53.300> you're<00:05:53.930> interested<00:05:54.320> in<00:05:54.410> HD<00:05:54.740> video<00:05:54.979> it's
