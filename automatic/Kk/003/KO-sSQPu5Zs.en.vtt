decision was to appeal to the Jojo fans

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.870 
decision was to appeal to the Jojo fans
demonstrating<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.980> finale<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.730> arc

which would then lead new fans to begin

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.220 
which would then lead new fans to begin
reading<00:05:01.370> Jojo<00:05:01.910> either<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:02.540> beginning<00:05:02.930> or

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
reading Jojo either for the beginning or

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.620 
reading Jojo either for the beginning or
