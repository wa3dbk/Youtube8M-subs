00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.460 
the audio so instead of using a boom mic
or<00:03:52.200> any<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.560> those<00:03:52.680> conventions<00:03:53.280> he<00:03:53.700> actually

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
or any of those conventions he actually

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.130 
or any of those conventions he actually
used<00:03:55.470> these<00:03:55.860> dictation<00:03:56.730> pens<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.360> might

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
used these dictation pens that might

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.930 
used these dictation pens that might
seem<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.740> corporate<00:03:59.130> world<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.640> he

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
seem like the corporate world and he

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.690 
seem like the corporate world and he
would<00:04:00.060> actually<00:04:00.180> put<00:04:00.540> them<00:04:00.660> into<00:04:00.810> actors

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
would actually put them into actors

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.340 
would actually put them into actors
pockets<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.910> leave<00:04:03.420> them<00:04:03.570> recording<00:04:04.110> for

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
pockets and leave them recording for

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.680 
pockets and leave them recording for
eight<00:04:04.530> hours<00:04:04.709> at<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> time<00:04:05.420> they<00:04:06.420> would<00:04:06.540> be

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
eight hours at a time they would be

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.699 
eight hours at a time they would be
wired<00:04:06.959> through<00:04:07.380> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
wired through that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.890 
wired through that
so<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.040> actual<00:04:08.310> assistant<00:04:08.880> editor<00:04:09.270> it<00:04:09.660> took

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900

the legal battle for this movie is a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.540 
the legal battle for this movie is a
really<00:04:50.850> fascinating<00:04:51.150> thing<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.780> follow<00:04:52.550> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
really fascinating thing to follow the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.000 
really fascinating thing to follow the
Disney<00:04:54.419> hasn't<00:04:54.720> really<00:04:55.050> made<00:04:55.200> much<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.770> fuss
