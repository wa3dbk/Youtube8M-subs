00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
show you how to forward your ports for

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.919 
show you how to forward your ports for
Minecraft<00:00:05.700> like<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.180> said<00:00:06.240> another<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
Minecraft like I said another video and

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.839 
Minecraft like I said another video and
what<00:00:09.929> you're<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.530> need<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:10.980> first<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
what you're going to need to do first is

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.359 
what you're going to need to do first is
um<00:00:12.410> check<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.710> port<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.490> made<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:15.120> your

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
um check what port you made for your

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.450 
um check what port you made for your
minecraft<00:00:17.369> server<00:00:19.010> usually<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.160> would<00:00:20.250> put

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
minecraft server usually you would put

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
minecraft server usually you would put
it<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:20.670> 2<00:00:20.850> 55<00:00:21.330> 65<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> from<00:00:25.199> once<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.859> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it as 2 55 65 so from once you know that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.089 
it as 2 55 65 so from once you know that
then<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.849> web<00:00:27.420> browser<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> you

then you go to your web browser and you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.270 
then you go to your web browser and you
type<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:30.800> router's<00:00:31.800> IP<00:00:32.130> address<00:00:34.280> Lea

you're going to want to do if your

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.050 
you're going to want to do if your
application<00:01:20.899> type<00:01:21.899> in<00:01:22.079> Minecraft<00:01:23.060> whatever

application type in Minecraft whatever
you<00:01:24.179> want<00:01:24.209> it<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.679> then<00:01:25.679> start<00:01:26.750> starting

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you want it to be then start starting

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.249 
you want it to be then start starting
port<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.469> at<00:01:28.619> 2<00:01:28.920> 55<00:01:29.789> 65<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.780> whatever

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
port you want it at 2 55 65 or whatever

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.969 
port you want it at 2 55 65 or whatever
port<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.219> assigned<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:33.179> server<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
port you assigned your server to and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.020 
port you assigned your server to and
then<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.459> n<00:01:35.700> @<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.209> 55<00:01:36.810> 65<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.679> you<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
then make n @ to 55 65 also you want the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
then make n @ to 55 65 also you want the
protocol<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> both<00:01:40.849> tcp<00:01:41.849> and<00:01:42.209> UDP<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.840> I'm

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
protocol to be both tcp and UDP and I'm

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
protocol to be both tcp and UDP and I'm
usually<00:01:44.099> on<00:01:44.310> Netgear<00:01:44.789> routers<00:01:45.179> you<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.929> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
usually on Netgear routers you have to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.190 
usually on Netgear routers you have to
do<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> separately<00:01:46.500> there's<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.459> both<00:01:47.640> option

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
do it separately there's no both option

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
do it separately there's no both option
so<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> need<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.259> 55<00:01:52.920> 65<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.640> both<00:01:53.759> tcp

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so you need to do to 55 65 for both tcp

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
so you need to do to 55 65 for both tcp
and<00:01:54.420> UDP<00:01:54.629> and<00:01:55.140> any<00:01:55.409> other<00:01:55.560> router<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.039> here

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and UDP and any other router but here

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.309 
and UDP and any other router but here
you<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.489> ripple<00:01:56.849> and<00:01:57.179> for<00:01:57.989> your<00:01:58.079> IP<00:01:58.289> address

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
you just ripple and for your IP address

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.069 
you just ripple and for your IP address
you<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.039> put<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.879> IP<00:02:00.000> address<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.629> what

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you just put the IP address of what

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.440 
you just put the IP address of what
computer<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> servers<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
computer the servers on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.960 
computer the servers on
and<00:02:03.570> hit<00:02:03.960> enable<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.039> save<00:02:05.430> settings

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.560 

and<00:02:08.890> things<00:02:09.890> are<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.369> successful<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.330> that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and things are so successful and that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.780 
and things are so successful and that
should<00:02:12.170> be<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:12.980> your<00:02:13.070> port<00:02:13.310> forwarding

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
should be it for your port forwarding

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.340 
should be it for your port forwarding
for<00:02:14.690> Minecraft

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.920 

and<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:18.550> will<00:02:18.790> allow<00:02:19.060> all<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.360> your<00:02:19.510> friends

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and that will allow all of your friends

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.740 
and that will allow all of your friends
to<00:02:19.990> join<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:21.100> because<00:02:21.850> they<00:02:22.120> type<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.420> your<00:02:22.540> IP

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
to join in because they type in your IP

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.210 
to join in because they type in your IP
address<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.350> type<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:23.830> port

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
address and then type in that port

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.840 
address and then type in that port
number<00:02:24.520> after<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.940> colon<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.580> will<00:02:27.730> do

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
number after the colon and it will do

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970 
number after the colon and it will do
that<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.810> while<00:02:28.960> we're<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.500> want<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> show
