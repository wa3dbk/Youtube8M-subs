00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.750
 English tell that 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.390
 a system is pretty cool it works 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.860
 therefore luggage on the luggage rack too 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.690
 do not transport that normally 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.260
 for the transport brings here suitable 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.640
 is 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.730
 Just take his example 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.280
 backpack and hang on here 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.920
 and the nice thing is that we are not the ones 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.080
 Spokes do not come in the chain 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.790
 but that in front of the hang emergency system 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.460
 here it is held that is one 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.590
 spacer and if you make the way 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.620
 it depends fairly close to the front derailleur 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.170
 300 messes up the backpack if they 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.989
 but fold down, they have a safe 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.559
 distance and can do that sensibly 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.850
 transport this is ikea bag because 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.970
 a pretty big bag and 70 liters 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 content cost in the internet 1 euro 50 and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.080
 is of course essential 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.700
 more powerful than the normal place 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
 bag I 'll show you that again 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.610
 a bicycle is attached which is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.780
 just such a small piece of wood such a 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 small wooden pole and I have this 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.890
 old handles that I just short 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.899
 that's your turn and I'm done 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.590
 would show you first briefly how 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.070
 with this hang emergency system too 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 We can do that too 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.829
 Christians had had transported the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.420
 everything already tried that works 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.039
 Well 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.070
 I just take a small harness 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.689
 makes the joins these lateral 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.990
 should the trend of beverage boxes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:57.500
 each other and put this on the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.509
 rack and the halo system as 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.329
 spacer moves just that the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.070
 beverage crates a little bit apart from the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.170
 so that I have with the verses 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.119
 I can not handle the crates 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.630
 So in a relatively small bike too 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.010
 I transport these drinks boxes 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.050
 think my effect that's me 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.100
 can enter into the pedals here to 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.690
 box to touch 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.850
 Of course, this also applies to everyone else 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.830
 things that you can transport with it 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.720
 for example, some types a bit 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490
 You can easily grow taller 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.480
 drive without his heels 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.819
 to touch the cargo to transport this 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.000
 Panel and I want to show it this way 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.269
 now dismantled looks sun builds the Sun 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.269
 tuned 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'm so tuned 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.200
 the thing with the rubber band so I have 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.180
 me this rubber wall that should stop 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.550
 this whole hang out system bit 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.560
 stabilize and fasten and that 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.170
 I pull now behind the luggage rack 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.209
 the rod and for here purely 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.690
 so now so schÃ¶nfeld does not rattle 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.760
 great and i drive and yes if i do 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.590
 wants to put off 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.830
 as a spacer would like to have effect 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.810
 then I have it so it is quite solid 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.269
 here's it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.310
 everything is super and good now 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.760
 the second thing that has to do is just 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.019
 this double is a little smaller 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.819
 wooden rod fixing the bags 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.780
 the veddel I here again by so 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.780
 that's also true
