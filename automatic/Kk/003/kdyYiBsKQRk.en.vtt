00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.840 
what's going to cover the tape this
a<00:02:04.440> little<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.040> too<00:02:05.190> thick<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
a little bit too thick so we're going to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.980 
a little bit too thick so we're going to
just<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.240> bit<00:02:09.479> thinner<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
just go a little bit thinner here and of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.330 
just go a little bit thinner here and of
course<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.319> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.709> make<00:02:16.860> sure<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
course you want to just make sure that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.100 
course you want to just make sure that
the<00:02:17.940> section<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.900> same

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the section that you have is the same

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.800 
the section that you have is the same
width<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.650> your<00:02:23.160> tape<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:23.850> shorten

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
width as your tape so we can shorten

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.090 
width as your tape so we can shorten
this<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.110> little<00:02:25.230> bit<00:02:25.440> doesn't<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
this a little bit doesn't know if you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.199 
this a little bit doesn't know if you
have<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.370> bit<00:02:26.490> too<00:02:26.580> much<00:02:26.670> rack<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.030> it'll

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
have a little bit too much rack so it'll

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.630 
have a little bit too much rack so it'll
just<00:02:27.240> obviously<00:02:27.890> fall<00:02:28.890> down<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> won't<00:02:29.370> stick

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
just obviously fall down and won't stick

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.620 
just obviously fall down and won't stick
to<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> tape<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.950> I've<00:02:31.950> got<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> section<00:02:32.580> here

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
to the tape so I've got a section here

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
section that we moved out of the way is

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
there and I mean the weft is completely

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.140 
there and I mean the weft is completely
invisible<00:05:35.000> once<00:05:35.389> the<00:05:35.539> hair<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.780> down<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:37.150> it's

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
invisible once the hair is down and it's

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.879 
invisible once the hair is down and it's
as<00:05:38.300> simple<00:05:38.450> as<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.289> mean<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.800> know

as simple as that so I mean you know

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.560 
as simple as that so I mean you know
when<00:05:40.039> you<00:05:40.160> buy<00:05:40.280> your<00:05:40.460> set<00:05:40.729> you're<00:05:41.510> obviously

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
whatnot instead of tape in hair

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.600 
whatnot instead of tape in hair
extensions<00:05:53.590> come<00:05:54.590> with<00:05:54.710> enough<00:05:55.010> sometimes

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
extensions come with enough sometimes

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.000 
extensions come with enough sometimes
even<00:05:55.789> too<00:05:56.240> much<00:05:56.419> hair<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.080> know<00:05:57.410> like<00:05:57.560> you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
even too much hair you know like you

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.990 
even too much hair you know like you
know<00:05:58.039> because<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.400> want<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.580> obviously<00:05:58.729> make

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
know because we want to obviously make

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.520 
know because we want to obviously make
sure<00:05:59.150> that<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.510> have<00:05:59.720> enough<00:05:59.750> to<00:06:00.139> do<00:06:00.229> a<00:06:00.260> full

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
sure that you have enough to do a full

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.710 
sure that you have enough to do a full
head<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:01.250> full<00:06:01.430> application<00:06:01.520> takes<00:06:02.030> maybe<00:06:02.389> 30

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
head the full application takes maybe 30

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.360 
head the full application takes maybe 30
minutes<00:06:02.960> depending<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:03.919> know<00:06:03.950> how<00:06:04.130> thick

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
minutes depending on you know how thick

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.159 
minutes depending on you know how thick
your<00:06:04.490> hair<00:06:04.669> is<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:04.970> what<00:06:05.090> not<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:05.450> if<00:06:05.690> you

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
your hair is and what not and if you

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.180 
your hair is and what not and if you
have<00:06:06.320> someone<00:06:06.560> there<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.800> help<00:06:06.830> you<00:06:07.039> or<00:06:07.160> not

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
have someone there to help you or not

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.890 
have someone there to help you or not
but<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.490> mean<00:06:07.669> it's<00:06:07.789> as<00:06:07.910> simple<00:06:08.030> as<00:06:08.300> that<00:06:08.360> and

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
but I mean it's as simple as that and

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.469 
but I mean it's as simple as that and
they<00:06:09.139> can<00:06:09.289> last<00:06:09.470> up<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:10.870> eight<00:06:11.870> weeks<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:13.479> they

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
they can last up to eight weeks and they

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.110 
they can last up to eight weeks and they
can<00:06:14.660> be<00:06:14.690> reused<00:06:15.260> which<00:06:15.470> is<00:06:15.620> great<00:06:15.830> because

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
can be reused which is great because

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.110 
can be reused which is great because
what<00:06:17.120> you<00:06:17.210> would<00:06:17.360> do<00:06:17.539> is<00:06:17.750> there's<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:19.120> remover

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
what you would do is there's a remover

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.240 
what you would do is there's a remover
that<00:06:20.300> you<00:06:21.080> would<00:06:21.169> just<00:06:21.260> rub<00:06:21.500> on<00:06:21.650> and<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.070> would

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
that you would just rub on and it would

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.550 
that you would just rub on and it would
break<00:06:22.760> up<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.060> glue<00:06:23.270> from<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:24.050> tape<00:06:24.260> and

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
break up the glue from the tape and

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.440 
break up the glue from the tape and
they'll<00:06:25.340> just<00:06:25.370> come<00:06:25.610> right<00:06:25.789> out<00:06:25.849> and<00:06:26.000> you<00:06:26.419> can

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
they'll just come right out and you can

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.820 
they'll just come right out and you can
apply

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
apply

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.120 
apply
new<00:06:27.010> tape<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.580> left<00:06:27.820> and<00:06:28.680> reuse<00:06:29.680> them<00:06:29.920> so<00:06:30.100> I

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
new tape to the left and reuse them so I

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.800 
new tape to the left and reuse them so I
mean<00:06:30.310> in<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.490> long<00:06:30.640> run<00:06:30.700> they're<00:06:31.270> a<00:06:31.540> lot

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
mean in the long run they're a lot

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.400 
mean in the long run they're a lot
cheaper<00:06:31.870> than<00:06:33.420> you<00:06:34.420> know<00:06:34.540> the<00:06:34.630> ones<00:06:34.810> that<00:06:35.020> are

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
cheaper than you know the ones that are
