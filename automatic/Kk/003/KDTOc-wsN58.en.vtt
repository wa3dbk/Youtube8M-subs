00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hello everyone in this video show how 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
 do on port opening cover 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.210
 trunk volkswagen passat b5 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.070
 now you see the result my cry 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 weekly works on I will show 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 I'll tell you what it is all about before 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 do something with your car 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.269
 I teach the mat part of collecting the necessary 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 information reading the forums and learn about how 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.710
 the same problem was solved by others on the fifth 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 complex loops installed 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 their advantage is that they are not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 occupy seats in the trunk as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.149
 for example is such a hinge design and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 the disadvantage is that it 's hard to do 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.910
 automatic need for this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 use hydraulic piston 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.399
 as on the BMW 7 series naturally 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.010
 reinvent the wheel and didn't just 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.520
 used such a solution is no longer a slave 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.370
 audi 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 comfort loops unlike ordinary 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.129
 there is still an extra spring and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 lever 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
 which creates an initial impulse 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 thigh to boot lid 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.860
 opened and then the trunk lid 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.299
 open the gas piston 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 naturally audi engineers have done so 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 to loop this audi a4 did not fit under 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.320
 lag facade even if you saw off traction 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.070
 on which this spring is attached 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 very lever 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.540
 and try right steal years five years 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 volkswagen she also does not fit her need 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
 redo 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 as it is shown in the following 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 photographs learn more about 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.390
 how to do this you can go to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 link under video 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.659
 but find the same hinge on disassembly from 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.150
 audi a4 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.850
 later it is difficult to sock after washing 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.650
 I personally could not therefore decided to go by 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 no other way to make these loops 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 independently again on the internet there 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.600
 a huge number of options solution 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 this problem 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 from very simple to fairly sophisticated 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 I tried to do the same as now 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.970
 you see in the photo but when 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.369
 folding the gas piston rests against 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.650
 spring so this would seem 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.410
 ingeniously simple method does not fit a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.750
 this is a working version of us external 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.149
 It looks very collective, so I do not 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 would repeat the reference to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.920
 source number 2 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 This is a variant of the well-known German 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.390
 passat + d and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.390
 reference to source number 3 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 and this is his higher quality and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500
 professional implementation 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.180
 which could be ordered on the forum 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.180
 site landing stayed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.500
 armed with this knowledge I started 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.050
 to fence your garden first made 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.930
 lever interpreted opinions he bent 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.489
 immediately then steel thickness of metal 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 was too small too 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.930
 enjoyed carving from thicker 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.930
 material but then abandoned am 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.959
 option number four is stationary 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.790
 mount the first option number five is 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.310
 stationary spring mount 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.150
 the final version then made a lever 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.750
 complex shape 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.920
 Once 50 rubles tried on customized pruned but 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.069
 finally got it right 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.349
 the result further drilled on the workbench 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.519
 hole with a diameter of 6 millimeters 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:40.049
 in the middle of the rivet fastening levers 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.910
 assembled for regular fit and fitting 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.720
 drilled a hole and inserted wolves for 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.720
 lever stop 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.440
 cut off the native mount gas 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.020
 piston 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.819
 to replace it with a longer in 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.560
 as a donor used old 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.380
 hinges and used lower mount 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.120
 gas piston 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.310
 This is necessary so that the piston does not rest on 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.959
 our new lever then this mount 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.060
 need to be welded 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.860
 because it is him who covers the whole 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.320
 load and sooner or later he can 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.450
 just fall off painted black 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.209
 best fixed mount 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.070
 spring weld or cut it 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.350
 thread because when the loop 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.890
 folds gas on stop retracts in 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.260
 the nut 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.950
 I had to whittle them down so as not to 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.440
 grass piston set lever 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.280
 everything is well smeared and used 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.960
 nylon washers to reduce friction 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.020
 cut off a piece of plastic dowel 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.370
 to put springs on top of it so 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.770
 as at that time I did not have 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.320
 original spring from audi 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.970
 I had to use a spring from 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.360
 VAZ 2109 brakes this spring has 24 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.470
 wire coil and thickness of 3 millimeters 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.720
 total length of that 10 millimeters 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.780
 the original spring also has a thickness 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.170
 wire 3 not in meters and length 110 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.210
 millimeters but 12 turns 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.660
 so I happened to work extra 12 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.360
 turns 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.970
 so that the spring was tougher otherwise not 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.910
 enough effort that's what I have 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.160
 It turned out important moment upper 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.230
 Mounting gas piston need 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.330
 be sure to change to lengthened so 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.770
 so that the gas piston is installed 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.530
 rod down 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.530
 otherwise the gas piston will not live you 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.930
 long springs from Lada enough exactly 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.660
 several openings then they stopped 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:42.000
 work after which I had to buy 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.610
 new springs from audi and set them on 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.090
 car with original springs from 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.040
 audi 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.530
 the boot lid opens at any 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.320
 temperature divinely street minus 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.910
 still need to replace the gas stop but more 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.910
 powerful as pictured 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.130
 Thank you all if you video has been to you 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.990
