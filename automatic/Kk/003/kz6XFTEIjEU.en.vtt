00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
of concept as such it has a few issues

for infinity after the job is done so
I'll<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.180> trying<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.720> solve<00:00:19.050> those<00:00:19.410> issues<00:00:19.710> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the future but this is what I have for

00:00:22.199 --> 00:02:02.460 
the future but this is what I have for
now<00:00:22.230> let's<00:00:23.100> launch<00:00:23.550> it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.920 

the<00:02:03.040> height<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.790> distance<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.540> easily

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
the height and the distance can easily

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.140 
the height and the distance can easily
be<00:02:05.080> changed<00:02:05.320> by<00:02:05.680> modifying<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.520> delays<00:02:06.850> at

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
be changed by modifying the delays at

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.810 
be changed by modifying the delays at
the<00:02:07.330> launch<00:02:07.540> pad<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.080> that's<00:02:09.070> what<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.460> Fink's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
the launch pad and that's what it Fink's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.640 
the launch pad and that's what it Fink's
