00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
science in itself right now the way our

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.699 
science in itself right now the way our
brain<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.150> physiologically<00:02:54.989> wired<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.530> that

brain is physiologically wired is that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.009 
brain is physiologically wired is that
our<00:02:55.829> neurons<00:02:56.280> make<00:02:56.670> new<00:02:57.180> connections<00:02:57.750> with

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
our neurons make new connections with

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.119 
our neurons make new connections with
each<00:02:58.700> inflow<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.930> information<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.829> almost

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
each inflow of information it's almost

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.729 
each inflow of information it's almost
similar<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.209> muscle<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:03.870> which<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.470> takes

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
similar to a muscle in which it takes

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.880 
similar to a muscle in which it takes
time<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.670> muscle<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.470> hypertrophy<00:03:07.470> or<00:03:07.620> grow

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
time for a muscle to hypertrophy or grow

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.369 
time for a muscle to hypertrophy or grow
therefore<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> way<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.090> stimulate<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.780> brain

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
therefore the way we stimulate a brain

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.009 
therefore the way we stimulate a brain
and<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.069> let<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.459> store<00:03:12.450> important

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
and then let it store important

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.680 
and then let it store important
information<00:03:13.560> such<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:14.400> NCLEX<00:03:14.970> information

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and content is through a balance of time

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.879 
and content is through a balance of time
and<00:03:19.519> repetition<00:03:21.049> now<00:03:22.049> let's<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> third

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
and repetition now let's go to the third

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.449 
and repetition now let's go to the third

preparing<00:04:44.010> for<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> NCLEX<00:04:44.430> exam<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:45.110> believe

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
preparing for the NCLEX exam I believe

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.460 
preparing for the NCLEX exam I believe
that<00:04:46.320> practice<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.430> indeed<00:04:48.120> essential<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.050> is

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
that practice is indeed essential and is

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.440 
that practice is indeed essential and is
a<00:04:49.500> requirement<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.250> as<00:04:50.910> we<00:04:51.090> all<00:04:51.240> know

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
a requirement and as we all know

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.170 
a requirement and as we all know
repetition<00:04:52.350> is<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.800> foundation<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.700> practice

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
repetition is the foundation of practice

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.530 
repetition is the foundation of practice
right<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:55.380> basically<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:56.040> means<00:04:56.540> NCLEX

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
right so basically this means NCLEX

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.380 
right so basically this means NCLEX
practice<00:04:58.169> questions<00:04:58.940> more<00:04:59.940> practice

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
practice questions more practice

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.690 
practice questions more practice
questions<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.050> more<00:05:01.590> NCLEX<00:05:02.190> practice

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
questions and more NCLEX practice

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.320 
questions and more NCLEX practice
questions

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
questions

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.659 
questions
this<00:05:03.900> strategy<00:05:04.440> basically<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.250> does<00:05:05.430> is

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
this strategy basically what it does is

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.409 
this strategy basically what it does is
it<00:05:06.090> enables<00:05:06.600> us<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.080> get<00:05:07.730> familiarized<00:05:08.730> with

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
it enables us to get familiarized with

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.110 
it enables us to get familiarized with
the<00:05:09.660> multiple<00:05:10.620> choice<00:05:10.980> question<00:05:11.580> structure

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
the multiple choice question structure

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.620 
the multiple choice question structure
right<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.110> at<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.650> same<00:05:13.800> time<00:05:14.070> retain<00:05:14.630> info

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
right and at the same time retain info

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.420 
right and at the same time retain info
and<00:05:15.980> content<00:05:16.980> as<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.400> move<00:05:18.030> along<00:05:18.320> now<00:05:19.320> also<00:05:20.280> we

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and content as we move along now also we

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.820 
and content as we move along now also we
need<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.760> careful<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.720> we<00:05:22.530> make<00:05:22.800> sure

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
need to be careful that we make sure

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.250 
need to be careful that we make sure
that<00:05:23.160> we<00:05:23.280> don't<00:05:23.460> let<00:05:24.150> ourselves<00:05:24.419> burn<00:05:25.080> out

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
that we don't let ourselves burn out

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.920 
that we don't let ourselves burn out
right<00:05:25.770> because<00:05:25.950> when<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.970> reach<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.419> level<00:05:27.690> of

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
right because when you reach a level of

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.530 
right because when you reach a level of
burnout<00:05:28.500> everything<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.130> we<00:05:29.310> do<00:05:30.120> becomes

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
burnout everything that we do becomes

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.990 
burnout everything that we do becomes
almost<00:05:30.930> counterproductive<00:05:31.790> whether<00:05:32.790> it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
almost counterproductive whether it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.350 
almost counterproductive whether it
seems<00:05:33.210> like<00:05:33.450> we<00:05:33.720> have<00:05:33.750> studied<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:35.150> spend<00:05:36.150> so

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
seems like we have studied and spend so

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.880 
seems like we have studied and spend so
much<00:05:36.540> plenty<00:05:37.020> of<00:05:37.110> time<00:05:37.700> memorizing<00:05:38.700> and

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
much plenty of time memorizing and

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.500 
much plenty of time memorizing and
looking<00:05:40.890> at<00:05:40.950> notes<00:05:41.160> in<00:05:41.340> reality<00:05:41.880> we<00:05:42.060> really

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
looking at notes in reality we really

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.380 
looking at notes in reality we really
are<00:05:42.750> not<00:05:43.200> achieving<00:05:43.710> anything<00:05:44.090> since<00:05:45.090> nothing

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
are not achieving anything since nothing

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.630 
are not achieving anything since nothing
is<00:05:45.570> being<00:05:45.930> retained<00:05:46.320> within<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.250> brain<00:05:47.460> and

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
is being retained within the brain and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.500 
is being retained within the brain and
on<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.720> note<00:05:49.160> lastly<00:05:50.160> the<00:05:50.880> last<00:05:50.910> factor

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
on that note lastly the last factor

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.290 
on that note lastly the last factor
which<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.050> believe<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.710> also<00:05:53.160> very<00:05:53.520> very<00:05:53.970> very

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
which I believe is also very very very

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.080 
which I believe is also very very very
essential<00:05:54.600> and<00:05:54.810> important<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:56.090> relaxation

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
essential and important is relaxation

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.140 
essential and important is relaxation
now<00:05:57.930> one<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.039> worst<00:05:59.250> things<00:05:59.640> that<00:05:59.789> you<00:06:00.030> can

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
now one of the worst things that you can

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.210 
now one of the worst things that you can
do<00:06:00.510> for<00:06:00.690> yourself<00:06:01.080> both<00:06:01.380> for<00:06:01.620> the<00:06:01.710> mind<00:06:01.979> and

do for yourself both for the mind and
the<00:06:02.940> body<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.539> placing<00:06:04.410> both<00:06:04.890> in<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.400> constant

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.980 
the body is placing both in a constant
level<00:06:06.300> of<00:06:06.479> stress<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:08.390> first<00:06:09.390> you're

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
level of stress and first you're

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.480 
level of stress and first you're
suppressing<00:06:10.560> your<00:06:10.590> immune<00:06:10.919> system<00:06:11.310> and

suppressing your immune system and

and infections and we all know that's
not<00:06:16.650> good

brain and our body what really helps is

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.839 
brain and our body what really helps is
breathing<00:06:37.470> exercises<00:06:37.919> I<00:06:38.190> think<00:06:38.400> breathing

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
breathing exercises I think breathing

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.640 
breathing exercises I think breathing
exercises<00:06:39.539> should

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
exercises should

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.030

be a daily mindful routine now when you

taking the NCLEX exam try doing five
deep<00:06:54.330> breaths<00:06:54.690> and<00:06:54.960> just<00:06:55.199> kind<00:06:55.530> of<00:06:55.590> place<00:06:56.009> your
