00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
leap off and make this incredible jump I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
leap off and make this incredible jump I
can<00:02:33.130> only<00:02:33.280> imagine

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
can only imagine

can only imagine
that's<00:02:34.420> what<00:02:34.630> Spider<00:02:34.990> Man<00:02:35.260> feels<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.190> his

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
that's what Spider Man feels like in his

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.850 
that's what Spider Man feels like in his
day-to-day<00:02:37.000> life<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.570> mean<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.380> was<00:02:38.560> set

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
day-to-day life I mean if this was set

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.770 
day-to-day life I mean if this was set
in<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.100> city<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.880> would<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.180> better<00:02:40.390> than<00:02:40.540> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
in a city it would be better than the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.050 
in a city it would be better than the
Spider<00:02:40.990> Man<00:02:41.260> videogames<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.250> because<00:02:42.880> it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
Spider Man videogames it because it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.270 
Spider Man videogames it because it's
that<00:02:43.350> first-person<00:02:44.350> perspective<00:02:44.800> because<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
that first-person perspective because it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.690 
that first-person perspective because it
conveys<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.390> sense<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.870> speed<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.250> well<00:02:48.460> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
conveys the sense of speed so well and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.270 
conveys the sense of speed so well and
conveys<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.300> sense<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.690> momentum<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.770> you're

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
conveys the sense of momentum and you're

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.070 
conveys the sense of momentum and you're
dealing<00:02:51.640> with<00:02:51.670> really<00:02:52.060> fun<00:02:52.300> physics<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
dealing with really fun physics and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.350 
dealing with really fun physics and
really<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> challenge<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.940> game<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
really the challenge of the game is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.970 
really the challenge of the game is
figuring<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:55.840> how<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.080> can<00:02:56.320> lash<00:02:56.560> yourself

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
figuring out how you can lash yourself

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.340 
figuring out how you can lash yourself
to<00:02:57.160> Iraq<00:02:57.480> propel<00:02:58.480> yourself<00:02:58.600> toward<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.260> but

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
to Iraq propel yourself toward it but

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.740 
to Iraq propel yourself toward it but
let<00:02:59.620> go<00:02:59.830> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> lash<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.090> right<00:03:01.240> second

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
let go of the lash just the right second

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.930 
let go of the lash just the right second
so<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.110> don't<00:03:02.260> run<00:03:02.890> into<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.220> rock<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.670> stop

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
so you don't run into the rock and stop

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.790 
so you don't run into the rock and stop
your<00:03:04.150> momentum<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.050> cascade<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.590> to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
your momentum but you can cascade on to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.380 
your momentum but you can cascade on to
the<00:03:05.890> next<00:03:06.130> thing<00:03:06.340> that's<00:03:06.550> just<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.090> reach

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the next thing that's just out of reach

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.420 
the next thing that's just out of reach
and<00:03:07.630> you'll<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.290> lash<00:03:08.560> onto<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.190> then

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and you'll just lash onto it and then

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.670 
and you'll just lash onto it and then
keep<00:03:10.060> moving<00:03:10.900> through<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.260> level<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
keep moving through the level and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.860 
keep moving through the level and
swinging<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.120> spider-man<00:03:13.570> does

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
swinging like that like spider-man does

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.900 
swinging like that like spider-man does
and<00:03:14.080> then<00:03:14.500> there's<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.740> you<00:03:15.580> know<00:03:15.610> there's<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
and then there's a you know there's a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.580 
and then there's a you know there's a
tiny<00:03:16.210> little<00:03:16.450> thing<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.810> need<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:16.960> land<00:03:17.230> on<00:03:17.410> so

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
tiny little thing you need to land on so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.500 
tiny little thing you need to land on so
you<00:03:17.650> shoot<00:03:18.040> your<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.790> tether<00:03:19.060> down<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.360> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
you shoot your your tether down to that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.350 
you shoot your your tether down to that
and<00:03:19.660> suck<00:03:19.959> yourself<00:03:20.110> toward<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.860> oh<00:03:21.010> my<00:03:21.910> god

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and suck yourself toward it oh my god

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.080 
and suck yourself toward it oh my god
it's<00:03:22.570> exhilarating<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.739> then<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.790> top<00:03:25.030> of

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
it's exhilarating and then on top of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.330 
it's exhilarating and then on top of
that<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.750> world<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:26.410> beautiful<00:03:26.770> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
that the world is beautiful and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.479 
that the world is beautiful and
interesting<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.239> lush<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.870> has<00:03:29.770> incredible

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
interesting and lush and has incredible
