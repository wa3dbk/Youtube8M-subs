so<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.409> very

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so here is you know I'm doing it very

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
so here is you know I'm doing it very
quickly<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> faster<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.939> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
quickly this is a faster way and it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
quickly this is a faster way and it's
it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> faster<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> simulation

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's a faster way than in the simulation

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's a faster way than in the simulation
but<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.490> necessarily<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.090> fast<00:01:42.509> way<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
but it's not necessarily a fast way but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.359 
but it's not necessarily a fast way but
I<00:01:43.320> mean<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.729> 50<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.689> about

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
two minutes maybe which is not bad so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550
