going back to this rice powder I love
this<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:38.369> even<00:01:38.700> tried<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this I've even tried just to go to a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.609 
this I've even tried just to go to a
pressed<00:01:39.659> powder<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> thought<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
pressed powder so I thought maybe that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
pressed powder so I thought maybe that
would<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.860> nice<00:01:41.159> change<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> pace<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.210> would

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
would be nice change of pace and I would

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
would be nice change of pace and I would
like<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> better<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> covergirl

then there is a little puff in here
it<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.269> looks<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.260> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> get

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it just looks like this I'm going to get

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.180 
it just looks like this I'm going to get
all<00:02:24.830> over<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.190> place<00:02:25.370> right<00:02:25.549> now<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.049> um

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
all over the place right now and um

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.589 
all over the place right now and um
there<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> little<00:02:28.670> bit<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.940> sifter<00:02:29.390> in

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
there is a little bit of a sifter in

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.960 
there is a little bit of a sifter in
here<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.500> guys<00:02:30.709> can<00:02:30.920> see<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.819> can

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
here you guys can see that and you can

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.610 
here you guys can see that and you can
see<00:02:32.150> that's<00:02:32.330> where<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.660> powder<00:02:32.840> comes<00:02:33.200> out

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
see that's where the powder comes out

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.380 
see that's where the powder comes out
and<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.430> normally<00:02:34.549> what<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:34.879> do<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.090> because<00:02:35.330> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
and so normally what I do is because I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.610 
and so normally what I do is because I
don't<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.720> use<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.959> little<00:02:36.049> puff<00:02:36.349> I'll

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
don't like to use that little puff I'll

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.229 
don't like to use that little puff I'll
just<00:02:36.830> dump<00:02:37.069> some<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.400> out<00:02:37.549> into<00:02:37.790> my<00:02:37.970> lid

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
just dump some of this out into my lid

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.699 
just dump some of this out into my lid
and<00:02:38.510> then<00:02:38.569> just<00:02:38.930> use<00:02:39.019> my<00:02:39.140> kabuki<00:02:39.500> brush<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and then just use my kabuki brush and

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.830 
and then just use my kabuki brush and
put<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.069> all<00:02:40.250> over<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.610> face<00:02:40.640> um<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.510> heard

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
put it all over my face um I have heard

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.020 
put it all over my face um I have heard
about<00:02:41.989> people<00:02:42.230> using<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> primer<00:02:43.849> for

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
about people using it as a primer for

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.640 
about people using it as a primer for
their<00:02:44.390> mineral<00:02:44.750> makeup<00:02:45.079> because<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.530> does

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
their mineral makeup because it does

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.140 
their mineral makeup because it does
help<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:45.950> absorb<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> oil<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.849> so<00:02:46.970> your

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
help to absorb the oil and so your

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.330 
help to absorb the oil and so your
makeup<00:02:47.420> won't<00:02:47.750> get<00:02:47.870> as<00:02:47.989> oily<00:02:48.349> as<00:02:48.380> fast<00:02:48.739> but<00:02:49.310> I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
makeup won't get as oily as fast but I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.470 
makeup won't get as oily as fast but I
personally<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.180> use<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.360> as<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
personally just like to use it as a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.509 
personally just like to use it as a
setting<00:02:50.750> powder<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.230> put<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.560> over<00:02:52.190> my

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
setting powder and I put it on over my

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.130 
setting powder and I put it on over my
foundation<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.239> think<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.720> works<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.110> best

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
foundation I think that works the best

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.860 
foundation I think that works the best
and<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.190> super<00:02:55.549> super<00:02:56.000> light<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.450> airy<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
and it is super super light and airy the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.539 
and it is super super light and airy the
one<00:02:57.019> downside<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.099> is<00:02:58.220> messy

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
one downside of this is that it is messy

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.400 
one downside of this is that it is messy
so<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.209> wouldn't<00:02:59.450> recommend<00:02:59.569> carrying<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.319> in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
so I wouldn't recommend carrying it in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.869 
so I wouldn't recommend carrying it in
your<00:03:00.500> everyday<00:03:00.739> makeup<00:03:01.010> bag<00:03:01.250> having<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.760> at

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
your everyday makeup bag having it at

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.420 
your everyday makeup bag having it at
home<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.510> your<00:03:02.930> makeup<00:03:03.319> vanity<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.099> great

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
home in your makeup vanity is a great

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.670 
home in your makeup vanity is a great
idea<00:03:04.549> but<00:03:05.209> taking<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.629> places<00:03:05.989> is<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.379> so<00:03:06.590> good

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
idea but taking it places is not so good

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.309 
idea but taking it places is not so good
because<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.129> so<00:03:07.700> messy<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.780> lid<00:03:09.140> does

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
because it is so messy and this lid does

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.229 
because it is so messy and this lid does
not<00:03:09.470> screw<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.849> very<00:03:11.150> very

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
not screw on and so it is very very

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.319 
not screw on and so it is very very
likely<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.349> leak<00:03:12.560> out<00:03:12.799> but<00:03:13.639> besides<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.060> one

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
likely to leak out but besides that one

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.910 
likely to leak out but besides that one
thing<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:14.750> good<00:03:15.019> for<00:03:15.139> your<00:03:15.260> skin<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.859> not

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
thing it is good for your skin it's not

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.430 
thing it is good for your skin it's not
cakey<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:16.549> really<00:03:16.880> great<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.269> summer

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
cakey it's really great for the summer

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.150 
cakey it's really great for the summer
maybe<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.889> put<00:03:19.010> some

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
maybe if you want to put some

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.800 
maybe if you want to put some
moisturizer<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.970> put<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.269> on<00:03:20.420> over<00:03:20.660> it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
moisturizer on and put this on over it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.479 
moisturizer on and put this on over it
that<00:03:21.049> would<00:03:21.200> be<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.350> super<00:03:21.799> great<00:03:21.980> way<00:03:22.160> just<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
that would be a super great way just to

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.500 
that would be a super great way just to
do<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.700> somewhere<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.120> don't<00:03:23.180> want<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.420> wear

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
do it somewhere you don't want to wear

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.729 
do it somewhere you don't want to wear
that<00:03:23.630> much<00:03:23.840> makeup<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.349> you<00:03:24.440> don't<00:03:24.560> want<00:03:24.680> to

that much makeup and you don't want to
feel<00:03:24.859> cakey<00:03:25.069> that<00:03:25.730> would<00:03:25.849> be<00:03:25.910> absolutely
