00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello how about friends of android if 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.810
 we continue here with the installation of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.410
 Android 4.4 in its stable version for 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.000
 any pc or laptop I have 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.179
 installed the operating system that has 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.120
 since we are going to share it and we are going to 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.860
 select him 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.380
 the operating system that we want 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.930
 start from when we started the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 computer from a group menu or a menu 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 of boot that we get and will go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.430
 directly to the installation and the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 preparation of the bios to install the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.150
 Android 4.4 iso downloaded but I have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 thought first about taking control 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.800
 Total installation of android and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 for this we are going to create a partition in 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 our hard drive where we want 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.309
 install android well those who have a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 Linux operating system installed in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 your netbook or laptop or pc and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.580
 You will know how to do this so I am going to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.310
 explain for windows users 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.310
 we're going to start and here we're going to put 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
 disk 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.240
 we go here to the option where he puts 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 create and format disk partitions 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 hard 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.230
 and a little screen opens up like this 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.210
 as you see here we have the partition of 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.760
 100 megabytes that is the cause of the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.870
 windows system and here where is it accurate 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.990
 given the whole system 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.820
 on the hard drive that you see is 297 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 gigas 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.560
 let's apply on top of it and let's 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.400
 make a volume reduction let's 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.400
 reduce the volume 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.890
 for in the reduced volume that is to say 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.610
 to create a new partition where we go 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.830
 to install android 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.680
 this depending on each one of the hard disk 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.170
 you have and the capacity you have 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:13.610
 you are going to be able to give it one size or another with 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.820
 16 GB is more than enough 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.700
 you can also install it in 8 gigas or 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.090
 give you more everything depends on the use that you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.090
 you want to give your android installed 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.780
 in the pc I advise you if you can 16gb 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.970
 since it would be like bone memory like 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.450
 if the memory that has any 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.850
 Android phone or tablet with that already 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.090
 it would be more than enough to be able 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.560
 use android 4.4 the latest version 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.450
 in our pc 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.239
 we are waiting for 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 to tell us the space that we are going to 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.690
 be able to reduce 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.950
 to be able to create the partition where 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.560
 from the android installer that we have 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.800
 created before the usb boat able bone the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.110
 usb bootable with android image 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.460
 tell him that we are going to install him in this 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.640
 specially created partition 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.710
 here we get the new screen where 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 we get the first option that is the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.980
 total size before reduction the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.120
 space available for reduction 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.819
 one hundred 133 thousand nine hundred ninety and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.310
 we are going to select here 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.440
 size of the space you want to reduce 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.670
 in megas 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.670
 we are going to select 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.480
 17,000 megs 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.830
 that would be approximately 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.390
 about 16 gb 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.390
 we are going to reduce it 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.230
 we wait for the process 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.020
 it's over and here we will have another one 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.070
 more partition that will be the one we're going to 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:21.970
 use to install our version 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.970
 of android compatible with all pc 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:29.160
 portable desktop 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.160
 netbooks et cetera etcetera 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.120
 we wait patiently for him to finish 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.120
 reduce the volume 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.379
 good not to say that it keeps recording 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.199
 well let's go to the unallocated space that 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.250
 would be 16 or 60 gigs we will give it again 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.250
 to the right button 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.229
 no simple volume 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.729
 next next action to the behind 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.960
 the unit is the next one that has 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.960
 free we leave it in e 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.970
 and the file system to format it 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.440
 we are going to give fat32 that we will do better 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.250
 for the installation of our android and 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.250
 we finish 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.060
 already put us right here we could already 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.610
 leave the installer or the listing 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.230
 of the partitioning tool of 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.080
 discs 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.870
 and we already see here how we have the new 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.700
 volume created that if we go here 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.680
 equipment we can buy that we have 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.870
 our ce disk and our new volume 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.900
 with 16.5 gigabytes that is where we are going to 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.759
 install this latest version of android 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.370
 good for screen recording 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:01.630
 because we're going to start installing it in the 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.150
 netbook the netbook as I have 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.880
 installed on the netbook I had told you 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.190
 before I have linux I think I remember but 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.440
 I have not used it for a long time 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.630
 what 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.750
 I reinstalled windows to do 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.460
 any tutorial or that changed a 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.740
 little history and we will install it 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.050
 on a computer that previously has 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.810
 installed windows 7 which we are not going to 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.790
 erase but we 're going to share 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.520
 we are going to install android in this new 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.730
 partition created and the android itself goes 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.430
 to create a boot system for a 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.400
 once we start the computer select 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:43.020
 with which the operating system we are going to 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.830
 start working or with android or with 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.650
 windows or linux him 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.130
 well see you in the next step 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.130
 friends
