well the hell bringer does too but if

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.930 
well the hell bringer does too but if
you<00:00:07.740> look<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.040> their<00:00:08.160> color<00:00:08.340> more<00:00:08.550> next<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
you look at their color more next to the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.000 
you look at their color more next to the
hell<00:00:09.030> bringer<00:00:09.360> it's<00:00:09.809> squatter<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.469> slower<00:00:10.740> but

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
hell bringer it's squatter it slower but

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.190 
hell bringer it's squatter it slower but
that's<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.849> I'm<00:00:11.910> saying<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.269> there<00:00:13.170> are

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
that's what I'm saying is there are

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.990 
that's what I'm saying is there are
measurable<00:00:13.889> things<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.429> could<00:00:14.880> be

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
measurable things that could be

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
measurable things that could be
different<00:00:15.210> ie<00:00:16.430> sensors<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.650> structure<00:00:19.650> are

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
different ie sensors and structure are

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
different ie sensors and structure are
more<00:00:20.189> mobility<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.119> mean<00:00:21.810> there's<00:00:21.960> multiple

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
more mobility I mean there's multiple

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.029 
more mobility I mean there's multiple
things<00:00:22.590> module<00:00:23.189> slots<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:25.039> there's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
things module slots like there's

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.570 
things module slots like there's
multiple<00:00:26.820> non<00:00:27.090> combat<00:00:27.990> oriented<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.740> even<00:00:29.490> if

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
multiple non combat oriented if even if

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.800 
multiple non combat oriented if even if
you<00:00:29.670> look<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> armor<00:00:30.269> instructor<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you look at the armor instructor and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
you look at the armor instructor and
firepower<00:00:31.199> there's<00:00:31.859> other<00:00:32.009> stuff<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.340> can

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
firepower there's other stuff that can

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.380 
firepower there's other stuff that can
be<00:00:32.880> buffed<00:00:33.530> or<00:00:34.530> changed<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.130> altered<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.700> you

be buffed or changed or altered or you
know<00:00:36.510> varied<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> make<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.890> different<00:00:38.219> than

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
know varied to make one different than

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.049 
know varied to make one different than
the<00:00:38.399> other<00:00:38.550> where<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.910> yeah<00:00:41.910> that's
