twelve<00:00:37.230> year<00:00:37.500> old<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> guys<00:00:38.280> said<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
twelve year old so you guys said that I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
twelve year old so you guys said that I
was<00:00:39.030> maybe<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.360> little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.600> too<00:00:39.870> rough<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
was maybe a little bit too rough on it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.270 
was maybe a little bit too rough on it
so<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.160> thought<00:00:42.149> maybe<00:00:42.360> I'd<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:43.219> revisit<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
