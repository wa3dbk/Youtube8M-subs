00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 There are more than 40 million motor vehicles in Germany alone on the roads 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.589
 In 2007, there were three comma 1 5 million new registrations 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.460
 In order to meet such a high demand, modern vehicle manufacturing must be in place 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.619
 essentially leave two things 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 automate many processes and produce high volumes on a daily basis 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.499
 For example, the audi-werk in Ingolstadt leaves average every day 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.360
 2400 vehicles 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.760
 because it astonishes already if you know this FRW of the threefold 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.080
 and assures this in modern car manufacturing 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.640
 workbenches 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.110
 In the audi-werk Neckarsulm, among other things, the super sports car Audi r8 is being built 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.860
 unlike the grand coalition with its automated processes and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.330
 high-precision robots 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.780
 until the r8 manufacturing a manufactory 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.590
 the top-of-the-range Audi r8 decided largely by hand 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.539
 we have a very high manual vertical integration 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.579
 To get into production, the hot scene in the choir as well as Warren Beatty of 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.660
 25% automation and in the assembly 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.150
 Percent, let's talk about one 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.640
 100% production 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.650
 but if it is hard to imagine 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.200
 Dec the preform of the build- the partnership 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 at the workbenches successively frame parts are made of individual carriers 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.700
 from all parts finally the base chassis of the super sports car 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.470
 but the human factor always likes to be a potential source of error 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.380
 Here is part of the solution is precision in the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.150
 Manufacture of the Audi r8 capitalized because we have despite the shortage 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.649
 vertical integration 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.389
 a very very close quality control circuits race the employees are 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.910
 very very very qualified 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.980
 when we started we have a very very 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.900
 qualified core force 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.680
 then used that he was part of the staff already at 1 2 at 806 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.730
 were used 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.159
 with very high expertise also very high waves 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.169
 I also saw craftsmanship, such as Ursula Heinen 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.139
 Welding 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.909
 For these employees initially have a good speed with qualified as 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.610
 they have there 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.089
 the body they pushed the vehicle 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:24.079
 the much-cited manual work is also in the quality control of the 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.039
 Body construction noticeable 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.499
 Feel employees with a particularly sensitive sense of touch 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.639
 If necessary, unevenness of the bodywork and scorche them 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.900
 So the dimensional stability of the body body in the areas big 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.539
 it arrives down to two tenths of a millimeter ago 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.949
 in addition to necessary body in a laser scanner office over 200 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.339
 New students scanned to perfect dimensions 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.919
 And yet, here in the production of the Audi r8, you do not get involved with the 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.609
 reached satisfied 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.319
 we go far beyond what is normally 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.149
 from a welder repeatedly waits with the head of this two-year-old 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.309
 Examining a Swiss because every employee qualified everyone 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.769
 Six months again 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.040
 after completion, the body is painted and goes 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.049
 then in the assembly 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.349
 Here it looks for the first time after a car if something else 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.589
 incomprehensible 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:22.769
 the disassembly of the now fittings interior linings engine and transmission 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.359
 just everything that belongs to an Audi a8 included 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.809
 Here, the assembly is divided into 14 steps from 35 minutes 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:35.519
 This is also a special feature in the vehicle that is the main difference around 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 Here in the small series is the fastest time 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.669
 Compared to this very short cycle times of mass production 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.189
 compared to the remaining 30%, it may even hold us 90 seconds 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.119
 the second 1 06 from the receipt of these 35 minutes 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.949
 He then brings an employee up to having 50 60 different assembly parts 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.889
 Of course, paired with accordingly thanks not paid to the vehicle 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.230
 so ahead 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.430
 until the complexity of the Serb had to work incapable for longer 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.019
 is surrendered 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.919
 you can imagine then calls must remember two minutes or must 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.949
 I 35 minutes on the job 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.650
 with great demands on the staff and every handle needs 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.479
 must sit with every vehicle 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:30.870
 to disturb 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.940
 and so it looks like when he has gone through the assembly 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.319
 but still the Audi r8 is not so far in the showroom 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.330
 after completion of the vehicle, the brand new Audi r8 will be an elaborate one 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.199
 Subjected to quality control 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.969
 the uniformity of the paint or the gap dimensions of tenths of a millimeter 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.610
 exact dimensions of individual parts to each other are checked as well as 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.090
 many more details 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.889
 it's like this if we're 100 percent, "he said 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.120
 Road continued 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.199
 to undergo in the content of the work in the household of the work that is it 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.830
 Focus on the vehicle again 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.310
 possibly storms question what crisis the technical picture of the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.749
 Entrepreneur KaiserstraÃŸe enlarge 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.650
 therefore, speak again 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.990
 As they say 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.830
 extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.849
 The Audi R8 crafted a vehicle that in a time of automation 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:26.720
 is built
