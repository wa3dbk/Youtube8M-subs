00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.490 
completely that's why young things can
do<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.360> well<00:01:48.540> against<00:01:48.810> those<00:01:48.960> matchups<00:01:49.200> there

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
do so well against those matchups there

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.889 
do so well against those matchups there
just<00:01:49.710> make<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> beef<00:01:50.460> tapa<00:01:50.909> mardis<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
just make the beef tapa mardis it's just

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780 
just make the beef tapa mardis it's just
painful<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.439> watch<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> fact<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
painful to watch I like the fact that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
painful to watch I like the fact that
this<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.090> got<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.420> Goyo<00:01:54.990> effects<00:01:55.409> built

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
this has got a little Goyo effects built

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
this has got a little Goyo effects built
into<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.689> kind

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
into it and I say little because it kind

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
into it and I say little because it kind
of<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> haves<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.520> attack

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
of is because it haves the attack

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
of is because it haves the attack
however<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.750> doesn't<00:02:01.020> mean<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.500> can

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
however it doesn't mean that you can

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.590 
however it doesn't mean that you can
summon<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.520> attack<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.329> go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
summon it an attack with it because go

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
summon it an attack with it because go
your<00:02:03.780> special<00:02:04.049> someone's<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.409> defense<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
your special someone's in defense and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590 
your special someone's in defense and
this<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.640> special<00:02:05.850> summon<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.450> its

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this you just special summon but its

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
this you just special summon but its
attack<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.079> half<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> interesting

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
attack is half and then the interesting

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
attack is half and then the interesting
thing<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.729> well<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.539> only<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
thing as well is that not only do you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.900 
thing as well is that not only do you
get<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.800> monster<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> get

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
get the monster but you get

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.150 
get the monster but you get
extra<00:02:12.210> 300<00:02:12.750> attack<00:02:12.840> from<00:02:13.350> each<00:02:13.620> monster<00:02:14.070> you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
extra 300 attack from each monster you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.000 
extra 300 attack from each monster you
control<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.030> even<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> goes<00:02:15.810> up<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> 3-1

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
control so even one it goes up to a 3-1

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.030 
control so even one it goes up to a 3-1
beta<00:02:17.340> which<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> huge<00:02:18.810> these<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.830> types

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
beta which is huge these are the types

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.970 
beta which is huge these are the types
of<00:02:20.190> cards<00:02:20.400> i<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.620> Fluffles<00:02:22.620> needs

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
of cards i think that Fluffles needs

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.850 
of cards i think that Fluffles needs
basically<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.760> fright<00:02:23.970> funny<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:24.860> they

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
basically and fright funny because they

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.460 
basically and fright funny because they
need<00:02:26.130> big<00:02:26.580> boss<00:02:26.910> monsters<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.930> things

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
need big boss monsters that do things

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.460 
need big boss monsters that do things
they<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.520> good<00:02:29.880> stuff<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.540> while<00:02:31.440> that

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
they just do good stuff and while that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
they just do good stuff and while that
this<00:02:32.160> card<00:02:32.460> might<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.940> considered<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
this card might be considered a little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.290 
this card might be considered a little
bit<00:02:33.900> dangerous<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.160> into<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.120> does

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
bit dangerous to go into because it does

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.240 
bit dangerous to go into because it does
require<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.900> many<00:02:36.990> resources<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.770> summon<00:02:38.130> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
require so many resources to summon it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.720 
require so many resources to summon it
it's<00:02:38.850> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.110> risk<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.310> need<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it's kind of a risk that you need to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
it's kind of a risk that you need to
take<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.210> these<00:02:42.360> types<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.810> decks<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
take with these types of decks and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.710 
take with these types of decks and
especially<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.580> Fluffles<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.240> fact<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
especially with Fluffles the fact that

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.610 
especially with Fluffles the fact that
they<00:02:46.500> are<00:02:47.010> very<00:02:47.120> underpowered<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.870> are<00:02:49.170> very

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
they are very underpowered they are very

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620 
they are very underpowered they are very
kind<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.370> under<00:02:50.640> supported<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:51.270> well<00:02:51.420> let's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
kind of under supported as well let's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.060 
kind of under supported as well let's
face<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.410> they<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.800> an

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
face it because that they have an

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.010 
face it because that they have an
incredible<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.060> any<00:02:54.450> stretch<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> the
