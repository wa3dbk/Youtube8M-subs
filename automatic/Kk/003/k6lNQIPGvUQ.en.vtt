00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.660
 dfb cup semi-final women's 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.440
 first she rescued Frankfurt second in the Bundesliga against the table screen SC 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.049
 Bad Neuenahr 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.559
 the Frankfurt national captain Birgit Prinz with a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.920
 Thigh injury not included 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 but the FFC also has Kerstin Garefrekes with 22 goals again tip 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.400
 and pure Conny Pohlers 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 just seven minutes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.969
 Since the seven-time Cup winner is already with 1 2 0 in the lead 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.860
 in the Bundesliga Conny Pohlers meets on average every 38 minutes already here 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.090
 after 7 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.580
 and under the eyes of national coach Silvia Neid among the 1000 100 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.100
 Spectators continued to put pressure on Frankfurt 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.580
 just seven minutes later Jennifer Mauro Chauncey Kerstin 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.670
 Garefrekes 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.410
 Cross and in the middle a beautiful flight header by Sandra 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.320
 Smisek 2 both 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.690
 again the Frankfurt women have Bad Neuenahr already 4 to 1 and 8 to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.600
 outdated 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.760
 and that seemed to me to proceed immediately 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.230
 But the outsider from rhineland-palatinate was quite as easily wanted 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.810
 Do not do FFC 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.980
 28 a minute a ricochet from Sandra Smisek comes to Nicole Rolser 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.430
 this was completely relaxed by the gnawing apartheid 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 This week, the goalkeeper has the first contract in Frankfurt 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 extended 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.990
 and ffc coach Sven Kahlert Ante probably that in the second half again 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 should come to his keeper Ben 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.259
 shortly after the break Ariane Hingst loses the ball Frankfurt 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.430
 sorted badly 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.630
 and Lena Goeßling fails others' investments 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.080
 At this time, the connection hit by experts for 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.390
 this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.159
 in the middle of the small Bad Neuenahr storm-and-urge phase then 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.159
 Sandra Smisek with this pass on Kerstin Garefrekes 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.229
 Garefrekes to the first guard fries to the second 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.320
 and that already on 01 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.710
 in the repetition again to see the determined Nachsetzen the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.900
 Worn and carried 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.520
 the preliminary decision 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.179
 but Bad Neuenahr did not give up yet 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.279
 after just over an hour Nicole Rolser was a bit clumsy 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.119
 harassed by Saskia Bartusiak 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.129
 Referee Riem may have to give him a penalty kick and if she does 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.429
 In this situation, then she has to comply with the rules also the red box 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:23.409
 whip out 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.659
 unhappy for Saskia Bartusiak while peeing the finale she is 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.239
 strengthened 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.560
 the captain Lena Gößling then and Nadine Angerer 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.020
 placed flat shot 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.949
 only three to 1 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.919
 and SC coach Thomas Obliers shows at 2 we still need 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.680
 Bad Neuenahr thereafter against ten Frankfurt races but without compelling 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.789
 opportunities 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.069
 instead, again the FFC with Sven century free before Tina all year 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.449
 to parry 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.729
 Both wont to bid after this action but could go on 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:01.290
 Shortly thereafter Schloss FFC Frankfurt wins 3 to 1 and follows suit 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.629
 a sacrificial fight and Bad Neuenahr for the eleventh time in the finals of the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.289
 dfb-cup but for the first time in the independent women's finale in Cologne 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.269
 So that for the big goal to enter the final 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.450
 meanwhile last word as a spectator since this summer is as 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.599
 Team we are looking forward to it 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.489
 if it was still celebrating and eating today I believe the people 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.350
 With no quota the researchers use I watch every time you play the game 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.739
 Lower back Frankfurt from 8 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 the photo Kommers rich 2 0 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:36.729
 we also have two hundred percent milk or no smarts in the smart 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.749
 will stop right now 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.909
 the difference from percent SC 07 Bad Neuenahr to the top team 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.589
 female national coach Silvia Neid was still the official for Frankfurter 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.520
 the politicians to the cup final 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.450
 On March 26, the FFC in Cologne must face the eternal rival dead of the protests on 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.540
 the edge
