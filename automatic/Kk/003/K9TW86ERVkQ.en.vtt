 let's put down here can destroy 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.350
 blocks that's why I put this barrier 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.180
 here because if you do not destroy this 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.760
 and here is the sound 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.760

 blocks and burns the ground on impact 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.440
 the achievement of fire is this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.840

 I do not get it why 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.430
 Well, as you can see, there has been a fire 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.740
 and let's leave minecraft and its books in 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.960
 other side 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 it has released fire that helps us to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.909
 catch us the pillory armor of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.979
 Mayas and mocri things from 'cheers' 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.750
 they also need fire to capture yes 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.540
 and we're going to move on to the next type of 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.430
 work that is achievement of the caves put 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.209
 caves has a greater area of ​​damage and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.069
 tropea diamonds and diamonds so we 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.040
 let's go down here to the cave this 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.750
 I have here done 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.780
 Well, the achievement was good, but 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.719
 well let's put the achievement here and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.099
 let's see how it destroys every king is 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.950
 is destroying the blocks that are 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.109
 are falling down there we're all going to kill 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.909
 see if it destroys more as vice is 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.370
 destroying everything and we're going to kill him 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.310
 see if it does not spoil the diamond 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.200
 Well, no son of a bitch 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.030
 death and hunger death more than death 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 death 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.080
 you die it 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.150
 It's worth as you do not let go of your rancid 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.140
 restart 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.849
 very good there, the diamond has skipped us 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.120
 and now let's move on to the next guy 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.120
 d 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.810
 of the star 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.700
 that if I remember correctly is the ghost 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.690
 so let's go out here and we're going to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.239
 close this and we're going to go to that if it's 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.610
 the ghost there are two types the normal of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.130
 fire the normal exposes the normal or more 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.800
 difficulty and tropea gunpowder and that of 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.150
 fire exposes to come out difficult and European 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 repsol 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.950
 we take this and we take this one 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.620
 the first ghost is to kill 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.590
 ah okay is why 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.560
 this day to lose to lose 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.599
 very well is the same 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.760
 this is the first ghost and this is the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.560
 ghost of fire this one emits flares 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.640
 and it can be seen in the distance already so now 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.640
 you can escape with time 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:11.520
 and this European 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.850
 and gunpowder and this rest and nothing else like that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.670
 let's move on to the next 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.639
 logos night attack you stand out 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.650
 at night old and you provoke them by day 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.169
 I do not need is to put them honest 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.449
 there are different types and as you can see 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.949
 they behave like spiders spiders 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.600
 also by day they do not do anything to you but from 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.940
 night attack you are bipolar 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.220
 Werewolves there are several types of 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.010
 day werewolves are human and of 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.750
 night they become wolves there are four 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.090
 types and the best way to kill them is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.090
 using gold tools as if 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.220
 they were silver 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.699
 let's see if I get around here 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.320
 fire wolf man who is this already 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.400
 they all start to change and we are going to catch 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.729
 one branch one 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.529
 the golden sword 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.180
 I want to transform this because I 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.589
 It is interesting that you see the fire because 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.589
 the others are all the same 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.850
 let's kill him 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.669
 and as you can see they move quite easy and 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.300
 they spoil us gold apples and things 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.300
 so cool 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.080
 those are iron swords in apples 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.810
 of gold and things like that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.770
 and here you also see the name of the wolf 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.259
 of fire that is the coolest of all 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 let's see that it's just that 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.470
 I was very good about things 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.630
 let's move on to the next type of 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.240
 monster because this has already 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.860
 taught the rats and you attack a rat 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.080
 you will be attacked by all those who are close to 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.660
 european with the normal rats act 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.139
 as 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.870
 as the ears 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.400
 and then there are also the rats of 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.400
 neder that spoil fire 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.919
 and here we have the rats and attacked this 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.500
 all are coming and the rats are 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.650
 neder that European should stumble 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.120
 fire 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.630
 and here in fire or I had it we are going to 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.750
 see that you die pussy and here we have 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.900
 drugged the fire so now we're going to 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.509
 move on to the last one and I think being the most 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.840
 hard to beat 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:27.050
 forgive the golems at the beginning only 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.169
 they have three blocks of an honor the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.020
 block of humor in the head and copper 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.090
 which is like a device and then 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.460
 absorbs blocks and forms the body according to 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.810
 you hit is getting stronger now 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.780
 you will understand me 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.260
 I do not have around here 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.930
 and as you can see here has in his head the 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.650
 cole and honor the the now can be 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.750
 anyone 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.340
 As you can see, it's almost always emerald but 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.320
 it can also appear from other things 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.320
 diamond diamond host 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.000
 but a diamond to beat it is 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.040
 quite difficult we have to kill him 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.920
 hitting him and he is going to go 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.530
 removing the blocks 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:13.090
 and the difficulty increases for 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.090
 kill him as he goes 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.790
 receiving blows 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.639
 and the core also change color 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.400
 what awe 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.260
 As you can see, it has many particles and 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.820
 all this roll 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.820
 so this is the golem 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.640
 nothing more to say is very difficult to 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.630
 beat but it's worth it because you 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.690
 European smells 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.220
 so subscribe to comment the X 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.220
