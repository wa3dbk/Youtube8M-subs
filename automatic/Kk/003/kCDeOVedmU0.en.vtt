00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and my computer used to be able to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.240 
and my computer used to be able to
handle<00:00:38.670> any<00:00:38.820> game<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.420> any<00:00:39.540> quality<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
handle any game at any quality but I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
handle any game at any quality but I
don't<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.579> what's<00:00:41.760> gone<00:00:41.969> down<00:00:42.270> hill<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
don't know what's gone down hill with it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.319 
don't know what's gone down hill with it
but<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> computer<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
but there you are it's the computer and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.529 
but there you are it's the computer and
as<00:00:46.110> soon<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> turned<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.340> settings<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
as soon as I turned the settings down a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.389 
as soon as I turned the settings down a
bit<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:50.100> perfect<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.480> mouse<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.989> fine

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
bit it was perfect the mouse was fine

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
bit it was perfect the mouse was fine
the<00:00:53.399> reason<00:00:53.910> i<00:00:53.940> thought<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> mouse<00:00:54.629> at

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the reason i thought was the mouse at

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
the reason i thought was the mouse at
first<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.379> guess<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.680> video

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
first I guess was because like the video

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
first I guess was because like the video
was<00:00:59.550> unresponsive<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> moved<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
was unresponsive to where I moved the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
was unresponsive to where I moved the
mouse<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.699> seemed<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> mouse

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
mouse and it just seemed like the mouse

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.130 
mouse and it just seemed like the mouse
was<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> problem<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> wasn't<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:06.140> now

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
was the problem but it wasn't and now

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.609 
was the problem but it wasn't and now
since<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.659> since<00:01:09.659> I've<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> hag<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
since you know since I've got that hag a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.149 
since you know since I've got that hag a
video<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:13.040> skyrocketed<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
