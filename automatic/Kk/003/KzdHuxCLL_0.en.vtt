him to find out what he thought of the

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.210 
him to find out what he thought of the
game<00:00:36.580> from<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:37.390> beginning<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:38.080> was<00:00:38.260> surprised

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
game from the beginning I was surprised

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.510 
game from the beginning I was surprised
and<00:00:39.520> intrigued<00:00:39.970> by<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.870> route<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
and intrigued by the route that the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.850 
and intrigued by the route that the
developers<00:00:43.059> took<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:43.660> ultimately<00:00:44.650> i<00:00:44.769> think

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
developers took and ultimately i think

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.180 
developers took and ultimately i think
it<00:00:45.129> was<00:00:45.360> extremely<00:00:46.360> clever<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:47.769> use<00:00:47.800> the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
it was extremely clever to use the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.450 
it was extremely clever to use the
masher<00:00:48.670> as<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:50.159> architecture<00:00:51.159> for<00:00:51.339> the

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
masher as the architecture for the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.549 
masher as the architecture for the
entire<00:00:51.729> game<00:00:52.059> but<00:00:52.330> i<00:00:52.809> think<00:00:53.080> that<00:00:53.229> the<00:00:53.350> key

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
entire game but i think that the key

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.500 
entire game but i think that the key
point<00:00:53.860> is<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.489> lot<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.089> people<00:00:55.239> who<00:00:55.479> have

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
point is that a lot of people who have

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.719 
point is that a lot of people who have
always<00:00:55.780> imagined<00:00:56.409> teaching<00:00:56.979> and<00:00:57.250> wanted<00:00:57.610> to

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
from the obvious in the mainstream and

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.690 
from the obvious in the mainstream and
then<00:01:30.969> top<00:01:31.509> 40<00:01:31.930> side<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.320> things<00:01:32.670> obviously<00:01:33.670> I

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
then top 40 side of things obviously I

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.340 
then top 40 side of things obviously I
understand<00:01:34.270> why<00:01:34.450> those<00:01:34.630> things<00:01:34.899> are<00:01:35.049> in<00:01:35.170> there
