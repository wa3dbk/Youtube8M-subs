00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and we've got some new technologies that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
and we've got some new technologies that
we've<00:00:26.550> implemented<00:00:26.880> across<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> line<00:00:27.570> as

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
we've implemented across the line as

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.919 
we've implemented across the line as
well<00:00:28.580> starting<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.880> our<00:00:30.420> new<00:00:30.570> propeller

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
well starting with our new propeller

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.709 
well starting with our new propeller
tech<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.529> propeller<00:00:32.040> tech<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
tech a propeller tech is you can see it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.910 
tech a propeller tech is you can see it
here<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> top<00:00:34.500> sheet<00:00:34.739> these

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
here kind of in the top sheet these

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.069 
here kind of in the top sheet these
three<00:00:35.219> lines<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.329> represents<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
three lines here what that represents is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
three lines here what that represents is
actually<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.340> cuts<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.820> make<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
actually the the cuts we make in the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.729 
actually the the cuts we make in the
laminate<00:00:39.780> underneath<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.290> ski<00:00:40.530> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
underneath the top sheet here so that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.150 
underneath the top sheet here so that
allows<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> ski<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.440> great<00:00:43.649> torsional

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
allows the ski to get great torsional

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
allows the ski to get great torsional

faster<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.490> aggressive<00:01:26.909> lines<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
faster more aggressive lines and and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380 
faster more aggressive lines and and
again<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.470> use<00:01:28.680> our<00:01:29.189> our<00:01:29.310> 21<00:01:29.790> Racing<00:01:30.210> play
