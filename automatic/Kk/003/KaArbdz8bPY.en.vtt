00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.580
 well I think 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 the problem of art 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.559
 General 1 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.559
 problems that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.720
 I think the problem comes good 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.260
 she comes so I think that from the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.850
 80 years 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 first at the level of music we 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.640
 buy stopped there is a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 a wave of two songs that are 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.760
 arrived from the Arabs to realize 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.650
 these lands that has practically invaded 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.470
 all low cost countries by a general 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.920
 and who practically killed the song 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.710
 Moroccan 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.379
 first guy cannie need aluminum 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.379
 well worth the stay she stressed 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.019
 the brothers maigri and nÃ®mes where stalin 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.059
 1.10 to the Moroccan song and is limited 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.230
 to that because she did not 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.050
 renewed there has been no 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.780
 two camps 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.860
 how are we already saying two are under 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.700
 now since who has the new 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.200
 government 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.740
 I think there is a president 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 respectively bastia a bit more because 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 that with the new laws for example 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 productions the only action of the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.110
 television the same at level 6 of 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.899
 mans there are a lot of problems that's at 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.490
 say directors and producers 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.710
 have problems to realize their 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 girl because the law has changed we have 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.530
 said to have first money for 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 to be able to make their life and there the wheel 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.470
 she hangs 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.360
 we know that artists dancers people 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.500
 is what we say the directors 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.750
 we know we do not have real 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.289
 producers because there is a background 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.050
 debt 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.320
 this fountain has to be won either 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.119
 dedicated to these things that is to say and this 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.160
 title the decrees monteith wanted as soon 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.950
 that he rides relieves thomas the good shots 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.570
 but 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.789
 his house that incarnated to have a little 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.869
 of money started his son arrested are 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.179
 fine because he does not have what 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.819
 finish and annie her the two or the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.530
 last three years I find that I 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.060
 personally find that there is a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.700
 braking at the level of intelligence and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.150
 family ie before produced 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.420
 ten to twelve to twenty films even times 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.849
 thirty films a year between the snrt and 2m 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.629
 now we are entering into product 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.950
 difficult and in addition it's the movies 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.180
 are of poor quality because the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.950
 means are not the winning times 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.290
 first tranche only arrives after 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.440
 three weeks of filming so the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.150
 filming and 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.470
 so there are sticks in the wheels and 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do not know if it's wanted you there 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.310
 it's just a way of seeing the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.400
 culture 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.650
 good I hope your are free 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.989
 things as we give them a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.670
 fund of help one is the directors and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.319
 producers work either in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.970
 estonia and the problem solved 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.440
 if we do not want things to have changed 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.540
 she teaches me let's stop doing it on 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.890
 ends when we close the snrt india where 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.490
 we have so many chains through 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.230
 the world that now 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.100
 eric catinot greenhalgh and blake no man 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.470
 show I dream there if jean shouted radi said 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.330
 irina we see a lot of things 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.670
 bring back from abroad for example 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.280
 nature challenge the turkish series and series 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.600
 brazilian ferrat or the mexican that does not 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
 does not mean bad work 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.490
 but we must give chance to Morocco's 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.470
 added make donations work update and 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.110
 if we do not have the opportunity to work 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.300
 for can never evolved it's to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.800
 to say he predicted the Canadian wild 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.800
 or in barge these nomads 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.580
 my friendship for m certainly we can even 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.970
 to play in the wait 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.080
 chengdu china has new world cinema or 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.080
