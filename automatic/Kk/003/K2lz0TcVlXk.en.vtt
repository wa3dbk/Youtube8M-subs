00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.450
 how about friends my name is gerardo 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.850
 Ramírez welcome to class number 7 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.219
 of solfege in the last classes we saw 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.740
 how to understand the four- stroke note 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.230
 the two- time note and the note of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.789
 fourth this time we're going to 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.420
 teach how to read the notes of 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 sixteenths 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.190
 we here have four notes that 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.080
 are derived in the eighths means 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.690
 that we have to read four 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.650
 notes for each beat is very simple 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.090
 see, I'm going to take a very long time 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.579
 slow 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 ah 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.430
 and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.910
 father dad dad 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.950
 ok i 'm going to do it again so that it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.420
 account is read four notes for each 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.530
 time would be 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.530
 here I will take me 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.220
 how would this sound on the piano in a 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 guitar or any instrument 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.659
 i 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.659
 Y 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.550
 they noticed four notes per time 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.610
 now we have this other value here this 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.479
 it's an eighth note with the dot 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.340
 more that 16 this note of tango us 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.010
 we know that half time is worth more 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.980
 dot dot active forgiveness increases time and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.910
 half 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.570
 and this 16 water how does it sound like 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:55.390
 this is very easy, this is how they are 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.390
 country country country country country 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.070
 if you saw here, look closely as I put 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.290
 these marks these lines that indicate me 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.690
 how much time of metric value goes to 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.869
 last this note this note lasts three 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.850
 times here one two three and I was in 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:19.440
 in room 16 let's talk it would be for 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.440
 dad dad 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.239
 for ok is in another practically enters 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.239
 setback 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.710
 for how it would sound on the piano this 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.710
 metric exercise meters 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.470
 Now look closely because this is 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.550
 invested good the values ​​we 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.550
 we can play with them 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.749
 ways and look carefully how is the 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.659
 sixteenth first and then to the note 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.459
 of eighth with cultivation this is very easy 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.150
 to read this is easier because these 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:18.019
 two are read automatically in the first 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 time for pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.389
 pa pa because it is very easy to understand 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.099
 good any doubt that they have 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.800
 just come back in the video 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.470
 now we have here this type d 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.630
 of silences is the silence of 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.760
 we would have seen sixteenths we are going 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.450
 to do the exercise that we have here 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.850
 up these notes come in after the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.390
 ok loud time is the two silences 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.600
 represent silences of 16 ao or I will 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.340
 he wants to put them like that for what 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.060
 or is an easier way to power 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.430
 understand 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.040
 I could have put it alone 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.550
 simple 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.590
 8th 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.520
 but how did I put this additional line 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.740
 this and the dot is automatically 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.990
 it becomes a silence of 16 knows 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.840
 that this is a way of representing 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.060
 sap resistance but if they do not want 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.060
 make it easier to put the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.510
 eighths silence that is equivalent to 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.510
 two 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.740
 just what it supposes so that now as 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.230
 you read these two are read after the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.150
 strong weather well dad dad now 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.310
 notice here how the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.650
 silences and first there are the notes of 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:42.210
 silence means that it is centered 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.210
 in the strong weather at the moment dad dad 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.390
 ok this obviously this 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.390
 when entering those notes 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.690
 obviously the metric value is the most 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.970
 quick eye I'm not the eighth 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.630
 because if we read we opted for this same 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.220
 speed 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:08.040
 we are the slogan of breeding for pa 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.940
 pa pa pa unlike those notes 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.940
 father 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.230
 ok faster the value now if you are 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.590
 let's say them at a speed 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.520
 plus 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.520
 elevated 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.460
 obviously the result deserves 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.510
 the speed that those 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.670
 notes listen to the metronome 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.820
 and remember we have to read four 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.820
 notes in time for you 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.740
 how that speed is done 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.249
 okay 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.439
 I hope that this class number 7 has 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.539
 served to understand the notes of 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.559
 Sixteenth and prepare for the class 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:22.379
 8 because we come to prepare sheet music 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:26.659
 for key piano of funk treble clef 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.659
 and obviously all this measure 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.239
 just the beginning of what is just ugly like that 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.069
