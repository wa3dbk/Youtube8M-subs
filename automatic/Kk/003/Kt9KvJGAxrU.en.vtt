00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 here we put the cc because she gets 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 additional protection then 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:15.420
 there for him to get there is not so easy and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:17.580
 so joked shoots hello dear 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.300
 friends the very grail and bugagames channel and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.670
 we will talk about bills today 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 regular account billing video 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.449
 video about talk about this shield itself 9 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.290
 these are the two pretty bills 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.820
 when I like a lot of things 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 can do thanks to these bills like 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 to build a ground road and airfield 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 In principle, you can do anything 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.989
 with these accounts means the essence of the shields 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.050
 you can also be helped to keep yours 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 your weapon is in integrity because well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.489
 You understand this shield 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 breaks it does not immediately look at 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 protection before you see him he has an armor 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.729
 some kind of 9 dashi cubes look at you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:14.850
 9 will find the same armor with him 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:20.070
 here but he has more volume ie one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.240
 such a plate on she can a lot of things she 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 can replace the general law of me 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 a few cubes by the way it weighs 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.800
 more than cubes so sometimes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
 some 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.490
 make it easier they just make everything from 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 cubes this way is also an option why 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.050
 no cure and look much cooler 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 look at the same shield too 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.430
 cool thing on 3 and what I'm right 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.160
 happy so what can you do with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.540
 using these accounts can do in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:50.610
 principle, any craft, that's it 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.860
 type in the middle you have there some 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 something inside there and around you can 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.160
 protect your object so by the way 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 you can even make something like a tank 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.980
 with the development of immediately fly vt9 because 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.780
 shield and weighs a lot one shield is it basically 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.670
 see to leave one shield in ft seventh 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 you are therefore basically can 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 something we meet there a deal is unlikely 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.630
 something will turn out 2 what can be done 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 shield it can be put like this 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.950
 Makar here so that it gives and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.870
 protection gives me it seems that what 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.440
 in addition to protection you can get hell 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.960
 from this 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.319
 You can also put it here 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.530
 more pain understood more to planned 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.530
 that you can also put it to him 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 another account so inwards that gives in 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.180
 principle of dual protection you some on 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.130
 that is, here you can start building from 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.489
 two sides such a shield is basically a shield and 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.810
 powerful by themselves but small why 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:01.970
 it is good to make a small tank 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.300
 But from such accounts, in principle, all the same 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.550
 they are comfortable see this here and stand 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.550
 here each account give carefully 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.280
 look at the shield each account has 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.730
 Here is such a notch how to say this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.959
 Here is the cutout on which the number is written 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.640
 39 to such things you can use yourself 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.739
 for the benefit of pussy as if let's say we put 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.739
 cubes so 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:39.310
 for example, this shield is safely deployed 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:45.610
 let's do it now let's deploy it 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.720
 we will do the other side like this 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.080
 any additional turns out 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.900
 protection under our weapons, that is, we insert 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 cis 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.590
 further away here we put the CIS and 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.330
 she see how to get 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.980
 additional protection then 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.040
 there for him to get there is not so easy and 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.350
 so essentially he shoots 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.900
 that's why I recommend using for 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.450
 letalok is very useful to protect but very 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.860
 convenient but clean it up here 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.370
 something like this is done 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.780
 here you have a plane well, let's say very much 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.240
 many i have done so far aircraft from 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.720
 helium that is without wings 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.400
 Yes, and for them the principle is such a thing very 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.800
 often a second lift is a little craft 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
 there is if you take the bottom here 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.300
 pay attention as he is very very 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:45.550
 comfortable and beautifully rises in the craft 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:48.610
 set that is essentially possible to do 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 such a plane whose they are so easy 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.060
 gets off a little by the way it is not necessary 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.410
 spend and flail too give it too 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.320
 Candela is quick with you now 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.130
 build and protect the wings not 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.130
 I think wonderful 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.950
 Here we have such a result 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:05.320
 maneuverable in magical things ship here 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.380
 Well, in principle, fly like nothing strength 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.680
 there is enough match enough in the position he is not 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.130
 there is no perry gas goes strong 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.890
 shoots 2 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.480
 normally in 2 the plasma did not fit and 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.570
 how much he 107 I think that in principle 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:24.040
 demolished very easily here but the essence is 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.190
 the principle of how they can do something 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.840
 I think that you can clearly put him 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.270
 the wings are simpler like that 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.860
 shoots and this is good 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.210
 hastily horses on so friends showed 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:47.170
 what you are used to 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:48.970
 account dancing are looking for t49 I think that this is for you 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.500
 would be useful enough on him 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.000
 It is useful to be honest because I have 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.890
 very many players who do not understand 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.920
 why do we need shields la la la poplar better 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.600
 do so guys shields need shields gives 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.760
 AMK is a definite advantage on 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.410
 by others I donâ€™t think that I can do anything myself 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.110
 but many many will argue and think that I 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.000
 lot 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.310
 I see everything in the comments not myself 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.450
 Forestry but this is my opinion and opinion 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:14.210
 this is mine here and subscribe to this 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.310
 channel subscribe to 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.770
 Stream channel also now appeared 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.449
 separately for stream channel made here with 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.990
 you were the grail it was bugagames channel 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.699
 see you friday at see you live in 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.229
 friday but again there stream as well out 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.960
 series will try to release each 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:31.970
 the day is not very easy but I had to 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.560
 something to donate our friends to everyone 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.560
 thank you all while the grail was with you
