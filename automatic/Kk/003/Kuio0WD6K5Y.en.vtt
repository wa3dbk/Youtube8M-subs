big deal this quantum q flash t5 dr with
this<00:03:33.310> turbo<00:03:33.850> battery<00:03:34.330> will<00:03:34.990> go<00:03:35.140> all<00:03:35.350> day<00:03:35.770> long

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
this turbo battery will go all day long

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.940 
this turbo battery will go all day long
like<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.730> because<00:03:37.540> I've<00:03:37.930> chosen<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.530> get

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
like that and because I've chosen to get

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.850 
like that and because I've chosen to get
this<00:03:39.190> light<00:03:40.080> another<00:03:41.080> several<00:03:41.530> feet<00:03:41.830> away

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
this light another several feet away

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.770 
this light another several feet away
from<00:03:42.070> my<00:03:42.310> camera<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.820> move<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.240> just<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.540> couple

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
from my camera and move it just a couple

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.830 
from my camera and move it just a couple
of<00:03:43.960> feet<00:03:44.140> away<00:03:44.260> from<00:03:44.920> my<00:03:45.070> subject<00:03:45.610> I've

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
of feet away from my subject I've

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.020 
of feet away from my subject I've
allowed<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.140> use<00:03:47.410> less<00:03:47.860> power<00:03:48.130> which<00:03:48.790> means

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
allowed it to use less power which means

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.210 
allowed it to use less power which means
the<00:03:49.210> battery<00:03:49.600> will<00:03:49.780> last<00:03:49.810> longer<00:03:50.440> all<00:03:50.770> day

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the battery will last longer all day

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.160 
the battery will last longer all day
long<00:03:51.400> typically<00:03:51.880> I'll<00:03:52.090> shoot<00:03:52.330> 300<00:03:52.840> kids<00:03:52.990> on<00:03:53.140> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
long typically I'll shoot 300 kids on a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.710 
long typically I'll shoot 300 kids on a
day<00:03:53.350> like<00:03:53.380> today<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:54.490> will<00:03:54.670> recycle<00:03:55.120> faster

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
day like today it will recycle faster

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.590 
day like today it will recycle faster
and<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.560> because<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.460> is<00:03:57.580> used<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.030> manual<00:03:58.570> mode

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
and in because it is used in manual mode

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.630 
and in because it is used in manual mode
it's<00:03:59.290> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.680> give<00:03:59.830> me<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> consistent

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
it's going to give me a consistent

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.240 
it's going to give me a consistent
aperture<00:04:01.150> output<00:04:01.660> every<00:04:02.020> single<00:04:02.320> time<00:04:02.530> have

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
aperture output every single time have

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.940 
aperture output every single time have
my<00:04:03.430> kids<00:04:03.730> hit<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.060> mark<00:04:04.300> now<00:04:04.960> if<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.560> need<00:04:05.770> to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
my kids hit the mark now if I need to

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.890 
my kids hit the mark now if I need to
move<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.370> closer<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.820> can<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.660> need<00:04:07.840> to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
move this closer I can if I need to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.690 
move this closer I can if I need to
change<00:04:08.050> my<00:04:08.170> composition<00:04:08.860> watch<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.430> I'm<00:04:09.550> not

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
change my composition watch this I'm not

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.400 
change my composition watch this I'm not
going<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.910> change<00:04:10.330> anything<00:04:10.510> stand<00:04:11.110> up<00:04:11.230> for

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
going to change anything stand up for

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.409 
going to change anything stand up for
Mikell<00:04:11.680> take<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:12.340> batting<00:04:12.790> position<00:04:12.910> like<00:04:13.300> them

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.230 

so<00:04:19.419> we're<00:04:19.509> going<00:04:19.569> to<00:04:19.720> max<00:04:20.699> will<00:04:21.699> clear<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.060> once

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
so we're going to max will clear it once

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:39.390 
so we're going to max will clear it once
to<00:04:22.449> clear<00:04:22.780> them

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.040 

okay<00:04:40.060> i'm<00:04:40.210> going<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.389> get<00:04:40.479> just<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.720> little<00:04:40.750> bit

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
around f7 the funny thing is we've been

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360 
around f7 the funny thing is we've been
chasing<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.449> sun<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.990> shadow<00:04:50.380> all<00:04:50.710> day

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
chasing the sun and the shadow all day

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.300 
chasing the sun and the shadow all day
long<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.990> lights<00:04:53.199> changed<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.160> many

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
long and so the lights changed so many

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.580 
long and so the lights changed so many
times

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.959 

excuse<00:05:03.310> me<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.030> walk<00:05:04.210> right<00:05:04.420> in<00:05:04.540> front<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.780> you

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
so we've had to increase the pack from

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.350 
so we've had to increase the pack from
where<00:05:20.619> we<00:05:20.739> were<00:05:20.769> earlier<00:05:21.099> in<00:05:21.339> the<00:05:21.519> day<00:05:21.699> we<00:05:22.179> had

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
where we were earlier in the day we had

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.899 
where we were earlier in the day we had
him<00:05:22.479> dialed<00:05:22.809> way<00:05:22.959> down<00:05:23.229> and<00:05:23.529> and<00:05:24.189> now<00:05:24.639> i'm

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
him dialed way down and and now i'm

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.139 
him dialed way down and and now i'm
probably<00:05:25.569> up<00:05:25.959> on<00:05:26.139> the<00:05:26.289> 500<00:05:27.009> watt<00:05:27.459> second<00:05:27.939> end

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:28.149 
probably up on the 500 watt second end

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:29.909 
probably up on the 500 watt second end
of<00:05:28.360> these<00:05:28.569> packs<00:05:28.989> that's<00:05:29.319> two<00:05:29.559> of<00:05:29.679> them<00:05:29.799> were

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
of these packs that's two of them were

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.289 
of these packs that's two of them were
using<00:05:30.189> two<00:05:30.339> packs<00:05:30.639> so<00:05:32.039> that's<00:05:33.039> why<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.639> big<00:05:34.089> boy

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:34.299 
using two packs so that's why a big boy

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.609 
using two packs so that's why a big boy
light<00:05:34.569> makes<00:05:34.989> all<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.259> difference<00:05:35.409> in<00:05:35.589> the

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
light makes all the difference in the

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.839 
light makes all the difference in the
world<00:05:35.769> so<00:05:36.099> I'm<00:05:36.249> going<00:05:36.399> to<00:05:36.429> adjust<00:05:36.699> my<00:05:36.879> camera

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
world so I'm going to adjust my camera

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.679 
world so I'm going to adjust my camera
to<00:05:39.849> my<00:05:39.969> meter<00:05:40.179> reading<00:05:40.889> and<00:05:42.509> we're<00:05:43.509> going<00:05:43.629> to
