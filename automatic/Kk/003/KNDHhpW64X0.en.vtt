00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 it goes up and down it goes up and down it goes up and down 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:14.880
 it's all that goes up an hour so goes down 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 also work the electric windows of the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 your car an item that combines comfort and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.270
 security in one touch 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 but attention this facility has also 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 their costs and, as with any other 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.170
 another component of the car needs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.179
 maintenance looks good to start 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.579
 there are two types of machines 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.100
 the most common steel and 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 gear teeth with iron teeth 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 both as well as 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.399
 any part of the car suffer from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 with the accumulation of dust and dirt what 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 over time makes movement difficult 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 of rising glass descent furthermore 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.379
 natural wear of the weather either early or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 later it appears in the case of the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 gear she ends up breaking her teeth 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 or game and thus getting well treated 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 already in the case of the cable machine it goes 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 shifting the steel wire to the breaking point 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 and the breaking of glass 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.799
 now the big question is how to predict 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.799
 What's happening 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.140
 when the manual mechanism is easy after all 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.160
 just look at the effort to turn the crank 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160
 as increases 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.650
 already when the electric system people 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.290
 you can observe when one of the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.990
 faster than the other or if 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.090
 listening to clicks or noises means 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 It's time to visit a son. 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.990
 I want car costs about 100 reais 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.780
 already the price of a new machine or a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.150
 kit gears can reach 600 reais 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.430
 to not spend as much besides being 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.810
 Watch out for what they warn of the glass note 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 there any more tips 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.280
 first if you have children do not let 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.619
 they play with the switches that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 decreases the life of the button and also 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.940
 Second spet cheer you want to open the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.890
 glass pushes the button the glass has already gone down and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.600
 you keep pushing the button 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 this can overwhelm the entire system 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.040
 besides affecting other components of the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.660
 and then prepare your pocket because the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.880
 repair can go expensive 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.489
 The third tip is to do the lubrication 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.989
 of the channels with silicone can also 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.910
 avoid a bigger problem 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.700
 after all, when they are dry or 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.190
 dirty they begin to understand the expert 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 since the book's launch is to have a 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.209
 car with the electric glass is undoubtedly 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.459
 one more convenience so be sure to 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 make the butter preventive ice time 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:44.790
 look for a small specialized is the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.790
 close to the football angle
