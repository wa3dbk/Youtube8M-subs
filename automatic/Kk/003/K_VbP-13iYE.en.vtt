normally<00:00:20.070> I'd<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.460> using<00:00:20.970> camstudio<00:00:21.810> which<00:00:22.590> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
normally I'd be using camstudio which is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.210 
normally I'd be using camstudio which is
it<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.160> lot<00:00:23.730> better<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.590> for<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:25.800> reason

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
doesn't seem to lock onto the camera

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.070 
doesn't seem to lock onto the camera
like<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> mouse<00:00:29.699> okay<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:30.900> we

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
like this to the mouse okay first we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
like this to the mouse okay first we
need<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> add<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> plane<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.880> delete

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
need to add a plane make first delete

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.950 
need to add a plane make first delete
this<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> camera<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.940> selecting<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> right

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this the camera I selecting it right

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.860 
this the camera I selecting it right
click<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.800> delete<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.210> /<00:00:39.510> space

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
click and then just delete now / space

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.610 
click and then just delete now / space
add<00:00:40.370> mesh<00:00:41.370> plane<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.960> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> size<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
add mesh plane but they need to size it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
add mesh plane but they need to size it
up<00:00:43.739> by<00:00:44.070> pressing<00:00:44.610> s<00:00:46.340> click<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.910> cube<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
up by pressing s click on the cube and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
up by pressing s click on the cube and
now<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> move<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.649> side<00:00:49.730> also

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
now we have to move it to one side also

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
now we have to move it to one side also
on<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> third<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.739> here

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
on a third now what we have to do here

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
on a third now what we have to do here
it's<00:00:53.309> give<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> dynamics<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> stuff<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's give a dynamics and stuff like that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's give a dynamics and stuff like that
to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> f4<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.020> pacman

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to do this you going to f4 or pacman

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.670 
to do this you going to f4 or pacman
figure<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.399> i<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> call<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> actor<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
figure as i like to call it actor then I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.030 
figure as i like to call it actor then I
mix<00:01:01.980> boundary<00:01:03.080> here<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.409> rigid<00:01:04.799> body

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
mix boundary here do you have rigid body

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
mix boundary here do you have rigid body
if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.270> which<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> probably

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
if you want you know which it probably

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.770 
if you want you know which it probably
turned<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.729> falls<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.420> turns

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
turned on so if it falls off it turns

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.890 
turned on so if it falls off it turns
around<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.630> that's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
around in that if not then no that's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
around in that if not then no that's
mine<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.490> using<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.000> sort<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
2-1 in over to torial now we need to add

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
2-1 in over to torial now we need to add
like<00:01:18.780> four<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> these<00:01:19.880> for<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.890> these

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
like four of these for these for these

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
like four of these for these for these
things<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> first<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.439> you've<00:01:25.560> gone

10-10 now if you piss p which is plane

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.020 
10-10 now if you piss p which is plane
mode<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.840> could<00:02:30.050> actually<00:02:30.200> move<00:02:30.670> your<00:02:31.670> cube

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
mode you could actually move your cube

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.320 
mode you could actually move your cube
around<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.130> that's<00:02:34.280> not<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:34.640> we're<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:34.910> to
