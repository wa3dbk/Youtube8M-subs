00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
fusion rifles alone as primaries because

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.869 
fusion rifles alone as primaries because
there's<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:52.739> much<00:02:52.859> ammo<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> map<00:02:53.579> alone

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
a little bit different about it some

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.129 
a little bit different about it some
people<00:03:05.760> may<00:03:05.970> feel<00:03:06.120> different<00:03:06.480> let<00:03:06.959> me<00:03:07.019> know

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139

rate<00:03:14.639> is<00:03:14.760> ridiculous<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.450> some<00:03:15.659> of<00:03:15.780> them<00:03:15.900> just

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
rate is ridiculous on some of them just

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.869 
rate is ridiculous on some of them just
like<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.769> ones<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.010> mentioned<00:03:17.040> before<00:03:17.340> calming

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.800 
thinking that the biggest issue with
these<00:04:17.459> things<00:04:17.669> because<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.269> already<00:04:18.389> has<00:04:18.659> the

these things because it already has the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.529 
these things because it already has the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
magazine reload over the shotguns is one

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.969 
magazine reload over the shotguns is one
the<00:04:21.630> smart<00:04:21.870> things<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.169> do<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.440> probably<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.860> be

the smart things to do it probably to be

as a shotgun in shotgun

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.720 
as a shotgun in shotgun
range<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.620> maybe<00:04:28.830> not<00:04:29.010> shoot<00:04:29.220> as<00:04:29.340> fast<00:04:29.370> as

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.550 
range but maybe not shoot as fast as
shotguns<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.260> nerf<00:04:31.410> the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
shotguns you really have to nerf the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.050 
shotguns you really have to nerf the
range<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:31.890> my<00:04:31.980> opinion<00:04:32.280> something<00:04:32.400> like<00:04:32.880> that

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
range in my opinion something like that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.580 
range in my opinion something like that
or<00:04:33.150> add<00:04:33.270> more<00:04:33.480> scattered<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.170> so<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.290> can't

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
or add more scattered to it so you can't

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.920 
or add more scattered to it so you can't
precisely<00:04:35.250> land<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.180> all<00:04:36.360> three<00:04:36.540> shots

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
precisely land you know all three shots

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.220 
precisely land you know all three shots
in<00:04:37.200> one<00:04:37.260> guy<00:04:37.620> like<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.010> quick<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.230> that's

it right it's got its flaws with the
reload<00:05:07.320> time<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.740> low<00:05:07.860> magazine<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.460> mean

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
reload time and the low magazine I mean

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.790 
reload time and the low magazine I mean
again<00:05:09.480> most<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.750> these<00:05:09.870> guns<00:05:10.140> for<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> game<00:05:10.650> that

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
again most of these guns for a game that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.240 
again most of these guns for a game that
has<00:05:10.980> pretty<00:05:11.910> awesome<00:05:12.300> balance<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.140> I'm<00:05:14.100> not

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
has pretty awesome balance and I'm not

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.380 
has pretty awesome balance and I'm not
one<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.370> those<00:05:14.490> guys<00:05:14.640> thinks<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:14.970> regime<00:05:15.240> is

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
one of those guys thinks the regime is

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.000 
one of those guys thinks the regime is
extremely<00:05:15.810> overpowered<00:05:16.470> either<00:05:16.650> i<00:05:16.770> mean<00:05:16.980> i

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
extremely overpowered either i mean i

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.380 
extremely overpowered either i mean i
can<00:05:17.220> find<00:05:17.370> myself<00:05:17.520> being<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.090> success

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
can find myself being just a success

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.120 
can find myself being just a success
with<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.630> shadow<00:05:18.840> price<00:05:19.170> and<00:05:19.470> other<00:05:19.770> things

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
with the shadow price and other things

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.790 
with the shadow price and other things
so<00:05:20.450> honestly<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.660> way<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.810> feel<00:05:22.110> about<00:05:22.170> this<00:05:22.590> is

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
so honestly the way I feel about this is

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.770 
so honestly the way I feel about this is
they<00:05:23.280> do<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.460> great<00:05:23.670> job<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:24.030> balancing<00:05:24.240> lots<00:05:24.660> of

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
they do a great job of balancing lots of

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.350 
they do a great job of balancing lots of
other<00:05:24.900> things<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:26.010> why<00:05:26.730> this<00:05:26.790> hasn't<00:05:27.180> been

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
other things so why this hasn't been

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.150 
other things so why this hasn't been
priority<00:05:27.870> one<00:05:28.020> for<00:05:28.260> a<00:05:28.290> long<00:05:28.470> time<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.860> beyond

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
priority one for a long time is beyond

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.860 
priority one for a long time is beyond

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
this but people would rather concern

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.630 
this but people would rather concern
themselves<00:05:57.419> with<00:05:57.720> like<00:05:58.500> miniscule<00:05:58.950> bugs<00:05:59.430> in

completely decimates and can get just to
worse<00:06:03.480> and<00:06:03.630> that's<00:06:03.810> exactly<00:06:03.960> what<00:06:04.260> happened

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
worse and that's exactly what happened
