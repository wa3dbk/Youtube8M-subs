in the world to bleach the hair or sit
around<00:00:25.359> for<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.599> couple<00:00:25.689> hours<00:00:26.140> but<00:00:26.439> you<00:00:27.039> know<00:00:27.160> I

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
around for a couple hours but you know I

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.759 
around for a couple hours but you know I
pre<00:00:27.580> bleach<00:00:27.849> this<00:00:28.060> quite<00:00:28.449> some<00:00:28.630> time<00:00:28.810> ago<00:00:28.960> and

pre bleach this quite some time ago and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.499 
pre bleach this quite some time ago and
this<00:00:29.890> is<00:00:30.039> kind<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.340> closest<00:00:30.699> look<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.330> can

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
this is kind of the closest look I can

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.680 
this is kind of the closest look I can
get<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.810> this<00:00:31.900> now<00:00:32.170> what<00:00:33.130> we've<00:00:33.970> done<00:00:34.000> here<00:00:34.480> is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
get to this now what we've done here is

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.350 
get to this now what we've done here is
basically<00:00:35.050> used<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.710> I'd<00:00:36.040> say<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.250> one<00:00:36.640> guard<00:00:37.060> and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
basically used a I'd say a one guard and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.390 
basically used a I'd say a one guard and
went<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.050> way<00:00:38.230> up<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.620> through<00:00:38.950> the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
went all the way up in through the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.880 
went all the way up in through the
corners<00:00:39.850> here<00:00:40.330> all<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.290> way<00:00:41.380> down<00:00:41.560> into<00:00:41.740> the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
corners here all the way down into the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.260 
corners here all the way down into the
back<00:00:42.070> now<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.280> know<00:00:42.400> he's<00:00:42.580> got<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.970> little<00:00:43.150> bit

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
back now I know he's got it a little bit

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.810 
back now I know he's got it a little bit
longer<00:00:43.510> down<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.110> back<00:00:44.320> here<00:00:44.680> but<00:00:45.520> this<00:00:45.610> is

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
longer down to the back here but this is

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.070 
longer down to the back here but this is
the<00:00:45.940> best<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.270> could<00:00:46.330> have<00:00:46.540> done<00:00:46.690> because<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:46.930> had

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
the best I could have done because I had

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.010 
the best I could have done because I had
this<00:00:47.200> mannequin<00:00:47.680> which<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.250> had<00:00:48.340> pre-cut

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this mannequin which I had pre-cut

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.950 
this mannequin which I had pre-cut
previously<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.640> comes<00:00:51.880> down<00:00:51.970> probably<00:00:52.840> to

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
previously so it comes down probably to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.140 
previously so it comes down probably to
about<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.560> but<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.370> goes<00:00:54.460> all<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.730> way<00:00:54.850> up<00:00:55.030> as

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
about here but it goes all the way up as

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.220 
about here but it goes all the way up as
you<00:00:55.240> can<00:00:55.360> see<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.600> corner<00:00:55.870> -<00:00:55.990> you're<00:00:56.110> all

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
you can see the corner - you're all

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.380 
you can see the corner - you're all
tapered<00:00:56.590> off<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:56.860> buzzed<00:00:57.070> off<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.850> top<00:00:58.150> is

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
tapered off and buzzed off the top is

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.770 
tapered off and buzzed off the top is
brought<00:00:58.840> up<00:00:59.080> I'd<00:00:59.260> say<00:00:59.650> probably<00:00:59.980> about<00:01:00.780> 2

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
brought up I'd say probably about 2

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.130 
brought up I'd say probably about 2
maybe<00:01:02.260> 2<00:01:02.590> inches<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.340> top<00:01:03.370> here<00:01:03.960> inch<00:01:04.960> and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
maybe 2 inches on the top here inch and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.470 
maybe 2 inches on the top here inch and
a<00:01:05.170> half<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.379> 2<00:01:05.590> inches<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> then<00:01:06.190> this<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.640> left

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
a half to 2 inches and then this is left

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.060 
a half to 2 inches and then this is left
obviously<00:01:07.990> longer<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.530> where<00:01:08.710> it's<00:01:08.830> probably

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
obviously longer to where it's probably

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.000 
obviously longer to where it's probably
right<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.910> tip<00:01:10.150> of<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:11.170> eyebrow<00:01:11.590> or<00:01:11.860> it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
right to the tip of the eyebrow or it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
right to the tip of the eyebrow or it
could<00:01:12.160> be<00:01:12.250> even<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.490> little<00:01:12.610> bit<00:01:12.760> longer<00:01:13.060> okay

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
could be even a little bit longer okay

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800 
could be even a little bit longer okay
or<00:01:14.650> I've<00:01:15.220> seen<00:01:15.520> him<00:01:15.670> where<00:01:15.910> he's<00:01:16.270> got<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> kind

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
or I've seen him where he's got it kind

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.590 
or I've seen him where he's got it kind
of<00:01:16.900> worn<00:01:17.140> all<00:01:17.350> back<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.310> spiked<00:01:18.670> up<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:19.390> this

all right
and<00:01:20.530> that's<00:01:20.710> basically<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.340> use<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> page

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
and that's basically you can use a page

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.820 
and that's basically you can use a page
you<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.060> use<00:01:22.210> hair<00:01:22.450> spray<00:01:22.480> I<00:01:22.930> just<00:01:23.560> kind<00:01:23.770> of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you can use hair spray I just kind of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.290 
you can use hair spray I just kind of
work<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.190> whole<00:01:24.340> thing<00:01:24.550> up<00:01:24.670> like<00:01:24.760> this<00:01:25.030> and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
work the whole thing up like this and

have it kind of spiked up and and that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.720 
have it kind of spiked up and and that
will<00:01:28.480> I'll<00:01:29.140> create<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.530> look<00:01:29.830> similar<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.520> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
way around this way okay so for the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.310 
way around this way okay so for the
color<00:01:37.270> if<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:37.690> want<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.900> bleach<00:01:38.110> your<00:01:38.140> hair
