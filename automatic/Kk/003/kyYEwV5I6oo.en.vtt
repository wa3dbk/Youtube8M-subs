 pillar is a geological zone within the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 has a controlled temperature for 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.800
 able to keep several species of reptiles 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.000
 and amphibians some trotes that have index 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.460
 are different conditions in total are 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.369
 60 species 130 animals on various radios 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.190
 aquariums each with the conditions I 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.399
 I feel so to have the well being inside 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.000
 of this Friday in infrastructure that is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.000
 clear 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.180
 the logical judge participating in 160 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.200
 production programs for species 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 threatened 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 these programs are aimed at 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.540
 maintain and is the genetic bank of each 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 of species for themselves in case of teaching 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.400
 As it has been done before, we can 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.260
 reintroduce to a species that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.180
 disappears from its natural habitat 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.180
 we can have it here let's imagine a 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.650
 male gorilla on impulse having refused 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.680
 several times with the female gorilla begins to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.070
 see a very large presentation in this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 trunk in do cerrito attention that marriage 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.259
 it was a male we will imagine from Holland 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 always keep our hurt and even 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:58.650
 even from the north the opposite 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.300
 animals being by many exist 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.009
 south central loan 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.660
 everyone has to gain from the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.420
 compositions become more real 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.640
 the world in this 125 years has effectively had 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.739
 a great transformation coming animals 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.410
 ambulance nowadays there are already some 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.440
 does not exist in its natural habitat 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.330
 others already have a complete stent is that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.970
 few that no longer exist in their habitat 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:28.920
 natural but the logical judge still 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.560
 maintains in us through organizations the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 country in world we have been programs of 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.959
 reintroduction of these parts into their habitat 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 Natural 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.690
 the judge today that it was a short video to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 that keep that holy flame animals 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.350
 source of the future 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.410
 generations know how animals 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.019
 lived to know more fought for life 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.700
 and how is yours because that gives us 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.299
 teachings and therefore languages ​​but the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.299
 own nature 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.290
 the tata 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.430
 I will be a beautiful story I think 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.500
 what fashion 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.290
 he lives in the heart here of us all 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.349
 we who work directly with him and we 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.109
 garden staff as a whole 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.870
 nazaré gave to the coast in the north 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.630
 beach of Nazare and was collected by a 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.150
 another member of the shelter calls 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.919
 Portuguese society of wildlife and 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.040
 where he was in the first three months 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.260
 only he grew up and grew from 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.960
 left head on the shaft came 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.240
 here and from there we started to 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.860
 taking care of a lot of work but one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.710
 rewarding work 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.450
 we often sleep almost at his 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.490
 side sometimes not sleep such it was 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.990
 there that nerves 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.389
 to happen anything we're not 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.410
 there to help because they needed the 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.690
 our help 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.330
 but fortunately this has not happened 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.740
 we had a lot of scares for a long time. 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.630
 time was fed by probe 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.320
 almost every four hours and 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.350
 night and we got because we have 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.070
 now it's a super super-audible animal 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.250
 happy 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.250
 jacob comes and now we are of joy 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.610
 mainly recover animals 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.670
 Cetaceans that shed I have many 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.820
 years of this and I can count on a hand 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.030
 the one we managed to save Nazare 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.440
 I can say it's a miracle 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.730
 so much that his name should not be Nazare 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.730
 to do a miracle 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:56.850
 my relationship with more sand is more than 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.630
 a father of a son of god who gives him 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.630
 it's the same to me 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.490
 We do not believe that this animals within 10 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.860
 20 and 50 50 before are different 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.840
 of the zeal of the jungle 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.090
 I believe they have the same friendship and 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.760
 was limited to my struggle for life 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.250
 the same craving of production they keep 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.340
 all these positions because only then 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.410
 we respect the idea that genetics 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.030
 one of the species we have to 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.210
 to teach people that these 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.970
 animals are ag represent the others 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.520
 that are out there and that if the human being 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.200
 not change your attitude towards certain 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.360
 things or do not contribute indirectly 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.190
 professing these populations the other 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.040
 animals will end up finishing this 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.140
 single living book we can have on 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.000
 animals when we walk on the skol 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.260
 books we only see the photographs in the 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.460
 movies we see the images here we listen 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.460
 the nature that is live
