goes<00:03:35.200> off<00:03:35.440> every<00:03:35.739> single<00:03:36.069> 56<00:03:37.060> seconds<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:38.079> it's

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
goes off every single 56 seconds so it's

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.449 
goes off every single 56 seconds so it's
kind<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.530> start<00:03:38.769> pissing<00:03:39.099> people<00:03:39.340> off

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
hold the diverter the power on button

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.540 
hold the diverter the power on button
and<00:05:04.750> what<00:05:05.750> would<00:05:05.870> happen<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.710> headphones

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
and what would happen the headphones

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.920

run but when the blue light stays stable
as<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:13.100> means<00:05:13.310> it's<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.490> pairing<00:05:13.820> mode
