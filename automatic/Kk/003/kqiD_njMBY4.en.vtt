00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
over depending on what you want they've

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.920 
over depending on what you want they've
gone<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:13.099> reason<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.519> got<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.930> and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
gone to and the reason it's got that and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.770 
gone to and the reason it's got that and
it<00:02:15.019> doesn't<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.330> bj<00:02:17.330> air<00:02:17.540> purrs

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it doesn't just have the bj air purrs

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.960 
it doesn't just have the bj air purrs
because<00:02:18.170> some<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> games<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.010> get<00:02:19.790> with

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
because some of the games you get with

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.550 
because some of the games you get with
the<00:02:20.120> Dreamcast<00:02:20.660> didn't<00:02:21.110> support<00:02:22.300> PGA<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.560> so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the Dreamcast didn't support PGA and so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.509 
the Dreamcast didn't support PGA and so
it's<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.830> take<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> look<00:02:25.160> at<00:02:25.250> these<00:02:25.310> games

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
it's just take a look at these games

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's just take a look at these games
here<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.830> here<00:02:28.040> I've<00:02:28.130> got<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.310> copy<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
here and so here I've got a copy of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.300 
here and so here I've got a copy of
cannon<00:02:31.010> spike<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.780> good<00:02:32.930> Kim<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:34.010> turn<00:02:34.220> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
cannon spike was a good Kim we turn it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.070 
cannon spike was a good Kim we turn it
over<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.360> back<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.750> Dreamcast

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
over and on the back of the Dreamcast

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.509 
over and on the back of the Dreamcast
games<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.440> tells<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.769> what<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.040> compatible

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
games it tells you what is compatible

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.900 
games it tells you what is compatible
with<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.030> tell<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.569> compatible<00:02:38.810> with

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
with so tell you it's compatible with

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.360 
with so tell you it's compatible with
visual<00:02:40.910> memory<00:02:41.180> human<00:02:41.450> unit<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.560> rumble

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
visual memory human unit and the rumble

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.430 
visual memory human unit and the rumble
Pak<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.850> but<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.870> doesn't<00:02:45.200> say<00:02:45.319> anything

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
Pak and but it doesn't say anything

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.420 
Pak and but it doesn't say anything
about<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.739> VGA<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.600> game<00:02:48.160> isn't<00:02:49.160> VGA

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
about a VGA so this game isn't VGA

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.729 
about a VGA so this game isn't VGA
compatible<00:02:50.049> there<00:02:51.049> is<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.200> way<00:02:51.380> around<00:02:51.440> that

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
compatible there is a way around that

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.490 
compatible there is a way around that
you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.069> either<00:02:52.220> use<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.239> VJ<00:02:53.569> box<00:02:53.900> here<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
you can either use the VJ box here and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.100 
you can either use the VJ box here and
just<00:02:54.860> switch<00:02:55.069> on<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.549> have<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.299> connected<00:02:57.049> to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
just switch on to have it connected to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.809 
just switch on to have it connected to
your<00:02:57.200> TV<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.310> come

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
your TV and then you can have it come

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.520 
your TV and then you can have it come
through<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.209> TV<00:02:59.750> on<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.140> normal<00:03:01.390> composite

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
through the TV on the normal composite

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360 
through the TV on the normal composite
output<00:03:03.530> bar<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:06.079> can<00:03:06.350> do<00:03:06.680> I've<00:03:06.890> done<00:03:07.160> here

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370

and this way you can with all the
Dreamcast<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.600> don't<00:03:11.780> need<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.109> have<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> match

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

then<00:03:46.580> you've<00:03:46.730> got<00:03:46.910> game<00:03:47.090> like<00:03:47.330> bears<00:03:48.290> here<00:03:50.500> let

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
then you've got game like bears here let

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.040 
then you've got game like bears here let
you<00:03:51.650> turn<00:03:51.800> them<00:03:51.950> over<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.420> if<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.540> can<00:03:53.720> see<00:03:53.900> it

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
you turn them over and if you can see it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.080 
you turn them over and if you can see it
but<00:03:55.450> here<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.540> can<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.900> it's<00:03:57.019> got<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.170> v<00:03:57.349> vga

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
but here you can see it's got a v vga

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.850 
but here you can see it's got a v vga
compatible<00:03:59.090> logo<00:03:59.390> and<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.590> one<00:04:00.769> will

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
compatible logo and so this one will

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.210 
compatible logo and so this one will
work

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
work

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.920 
work
listen<00:04:01.519> or<00:04:01.610> work<00:04:01.730> fine<00:04:01.940> with<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.269> your<00:04:02.599> VGA

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
listen or work fine with you your VGA

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
via if you got like again that doesn't

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.369 
via if you got like again that doesn't
support<00:05:27.830> em<00:05:29.749> Vijay<00:05:30.749> and<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.080> can't<00:05:31.259> be

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
support em Vijay and it can't be

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.469 
support em Vijay and it can't be
modified<00:05:31.529> to<00:05:32.099> support<00:05:32.309> that<00:05:32.699> through

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
modified to support that through

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.739 
modified to support that through
software<00:05:34.939> then<00:05:35.939> obviously<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.389> can<00:05:36.569> switch

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:36.749 
software then obviously you can switch

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.480 
software then obviously you can switch
it<00:05:36.870> over<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.439> just<00:05:37.889> play<00:05:38.069> it<00:05:38.189> through<00:05:38.309> your

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
it over and just play it through your

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.939 
it over and just play it through your
normal<00:05:38.809> compass<00:05:39.809> a<00:05:39.900> video<00:05:40.139> there<00:05:40.349> or<00:05:40.559> s-video

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
normal compass a video there or s-video

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.230 
normal compass a video there or s-video
and<00:05:42.740> some<00:05:43.740> games<00:05:43.979> I<00:05:44.129> think<00:05:44.189> this<00:05:44.520> one<00:05:44.759> one<00:05:45.120> or

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
and some games I think this one one or

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.719 
and some games I think this one one or
two<00:05:45.389> of<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.870> early<00:05:46.439> ones<00:05:47.039> titles<00:05:47.550> don't

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
two of the early ones titles don't

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.510 
two of the early ones titles don't
support<00:05:48.150> VGA<00:05:48.539> at<00:05:49.229> all<00:05:49.499> you<00:05:49.740> can't<00:05:49.949> even<00:05:50.069> modify

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
support VGA at all you can't even modify

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.170 
support VGA at all you can't even modify
them<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:50.729> support<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.559> think<00:05:52.559> it<00:05:52.860> was<00:05:53.009> a<00:05:53.180> Hydra

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
them to support I think it was a Hydra

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.420 
them to support I think it was a Hydra
Thunder<00:05:54.539> game<00:05:55.319> like<00:05:55.499> that<00:05:55.529> that<00:05:56.249> doesn't

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
Thunder game like that that doesn't

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.179 
Thunder game like that that doesn't
support<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:56.999> and<00:05:57.599> so<00:05:58.139> either<00:05:58.740> way<00:05:59.039> you're

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
support that and so either way you're

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.200 
support that and so either way you're
gonna<00:05:59.370> be<00:05:59.490> forced<00:05:59.789> he's<00:05:59.999> the<00:06:01.789> the<00:06:02.789> old<00:06:02.909> scope

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
gonna be forced he's the the old scope

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.879 
gonna be forced he's the the old scope
comes<00:06:03.659> a<00:06:03.900> but<00:06:04.080> no<00:06:04.199> video<00:06:04.560> silence<00:06:05.099> buffer<00:06:05.550> and

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
comes a but no video silence buffer and

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.519 
comes a but no video silence buffer and
the<00:06:07.889> most<00:06:08.099> games<00:06:08.310> well<00:06:08.610> support<00:06:08.909> VGA<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.529> the

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
the most games well support VGA and the

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.649 
the most games well support VGA and the
deal<00:06:10.889> quality<00:06:11.339> you<00:06:11.430> get<00:06:11.610> from<00:06:11.669> it<00:06:11.939> is<00:06:12.060> really

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
deal quality you get from it is really

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.350 
deal quality you get from it is really
really<00:06:13.050> really<00:06:13.229> good<00:06:13.379> and<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:14.610> have<00:06:15.060> tried

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
really really good and I have tried

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.719 
really really good and I have tried
several<00:06:16.080> times<00:06:16.289> to<00:06:16.589> try<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.419> film<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.860> but

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
several times to try and film it and but

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.860 
several times to try and film it and but
it's<00:06:20.999> just<00:06:22.189> too<00:06:23.189> difficult<00:06:23.339> to<00:06:24.149> actually<00:06:24.479> give

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
it's just too difficult to actually give

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.689 
it's just too difficult to actually give
you<00:06:24.930> an<00:06:25.020> idea<00:06:25.169> of<00:06:25.349> the<00:06:25.979> quality<00:06:26.129> you'll<00:06:26.520> get

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
you an idea of the quality you'll get

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.779 
you an idea of the quality you'll get
from<00:06:27.599> using<00:06:27.809> the<00:06:28.020> VGA<00:06:28.319> box<00:06:28.620> basically<00:06:29.490> just

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
from using the VGA box basically just

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.700 
from using the VGA box basically just
because<00:06:30.089> if<00:06:30.990> you're<00:06:31.139> using<00:06:31.169> the<00:06:31.409> camera<00:06:31.680> to

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
because if you're using the camera to

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.260 
because if you're using the camera to
film<00:06:31.889> the<00:06:32.069> screen<00:06:32.310> then<00:06:32.669> obviously<00:06:32.819> again

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
film the screen then obviously again

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.119 
film the screen then obviously again
quality<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.529> quality<00:06:34.710> is<00:06:34.919> going<00:06:35.009> to<00:06:35.069> be

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
quality the quality is going to be

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.619 
quality the quality is going to be
degraded<00:06:35.639> when<00:06:35.789> you<00:06:35.849> actually<00:06:35.969> see<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.479> back

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
degraded when you actually see it back

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.929 
degraded when you actually see it back
on<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:36.839> PC<00:06:37.830> screen<00:06:38.009> and<00:06:38.279> then<00:06:38.370> especially<00:06:38.610> if

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
on a PC screen and then especially if

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:41.239 
on a PC screen and then especially if
you're<00:06:39.089> watching<00:06:39.330> on<00:06:39.449> YouTube<00:06:39.599> and<00:06:40.249> again

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
you're watching on YouTube and again

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.709 
you're watching on YouTube and again
it's<00:06:41.430> going<00:06:41.580> to<00:06:41.639> be<00:06:41.729> even<00:06:42.180> less<00:06:42.449> better

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
it's going to be even less better

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.499 
it's going to be even less better
quality<00:06:43.199> so<00:06:43.349> and<00:06:43.909> you<00:06:44.909> just<00:06:45.060> have<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.270> take<00:06:45.389> my
