00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
ATX power supply yeah I've kind of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.570 
ATX power supply yeah I've kind of
already<00:00:28.080> taken<00:00:28.410> plastic<00:00:28.740> off<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.070> can

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
already taken plastic off because it can

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
already taken plastic off because it can
give<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> weird<00:00:30.029> shine<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.449> North<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.840> about

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
give a weird shine but North go about

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.590 
give a weird shine but North go about
that<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.700> side<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.059> box<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.450> have

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
disk drives and stuff ok earth we have

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.429 
disk drives and stuff ok earth we have
six<00:01:16.830> 4-pin<00:01:17.280> molex<00:01:17.310> connectors<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
six 4-pin molex connectors on to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.270 
six 4-pin molex connectors on to
floppies<00:01:21.259> alright<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.470> i'll<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.590> read<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
floppies alright so i'll just read on

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
floppies alright so i'll just read on
the<00:01:23.369> camera<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the camera now so here we have the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.940 
the camera now so here we have the
efficiency<00:01:25.850> table<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> back<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> box

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
efficiency table on the back of the box

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.969 
efficiency table on the back of the box
which<00:01:28.950> shows<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.540> ten-cent<00:01:30.540> mode<00:01:30.720> yeah<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:33.979> temp

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
which shows a ten-cent mode yeah a temp

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.060 
which shows a ten-cent mode yeah a temp
sent<00:01:35.159> mold<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:36.049> eighty<00:01:37.070> percent

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
sent mold is at eighty percent

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
sent mold is at eighty percent
efficiency<00:01:38.900> fifty<00:01:39.900> percent<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.890> think

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
efficiency fifty percent is that I think

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.780 
efficiency fifty percent is that I think
it's<00:01:41.610> ninety<00:01:41.970> percent<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.070> then<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.700> hundred

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it's ninety percent and then one hundred

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.139 
it's ninety percent and then one hundred
percent<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.540> 88<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> I'll<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.549> pass<00:01:47.880> by

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
percent is at 88 so I'll pretty pass by

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.520 
percent is at 88 so I'll pretty pass by
for<00:01:49.079> efficiency<00:01:49.829> wise<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.280> sir<00:01:50.579> yep<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> then

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
for efficiency wise so sir yep and then

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.530 
for efficiency wise so sir yep and then
moving<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:52.979> we've<00:01:53.729> got<00:01:54.229> noise<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:56.549> 10<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
moving over we've got noise then 10 and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.240 
moving over we've got noise then 10 and
fifty<00:01:57.899> percent<00:01:58.770> load<00:01:59.659> it's<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:01.469> below<00:02:01.710> 20

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
fifty percent load it's just below 20

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
fifty percent load it's just below 20
don't<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.750> well

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
don't know if you can see that well

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.730 
don't know if you can see that well
alright<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.390> hundred<00:02:07.350> percent<00:02:07.409> world

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
alright and then a hundred percent world

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.760 
alright and then a hundred percent world
we've<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:09.119> below<00:02:09.479> 40<00:02:09.929> decibels<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
we've got just below 40 decibels so the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
we've got just below 40 decibels so the
fun<00:02:10.950> doesn't

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
fun doesn't

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.569 
fun doesn't
put<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.659> loud<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.409> you<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:14.129> you<00:02:14.280> really

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
put that loud if you can if you really

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.209 
put that loud if you can if you really
want<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> silent<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.659> i'm<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.799> sure<00:02:16.980> i<00:02:17.010> have

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
want the silent then i'm not sure i have

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.280 
want the silent then i'm not sure i have
to<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.609> maybe<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.390> scion<00:02:18.689> pro<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to go with maybe a scion pro that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.920 
to go with maybe a scion pro that
corsair<00:02:19.709> maybe<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.760> doesn't<00:02:20.969> know<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.629> one

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
corsair maybe it doesn't know really one

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.089 
corsair maybe it doesn't know really one
I<00:02:21.959> know<00:02:22.280> right<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.640> now<00:02:23.969> let's<00:02:24.769> get<00:02:25.769> started

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
I know right so now let's get started

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.069 
I know right so now let's get started
with<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> two<00:02:27.120> unboxing<00:02:29.720> alright<00:02:30.720> so

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
with the two unboxing alright so

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.979 
with the two unboxing alright so
obviously<00:02:31.769> here<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.489> warranty<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.299> rip

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
obviously here we have warranty go rip

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.479 
obviously here we have warranty go rip
there's<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.769> camera<00:02:35.359> no<00:02:36.359> one<00:02:36.450> cares<00:02:36.540> about<00:02:36.629> that

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
there's a camera no one cares about that

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.460 
there's a camera no one cares about that
no<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.150> then<00:02:39.659> I<00:02:39.689> got<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.019> little

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
