this<00:05:09.280> but<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:10.090> think<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:10.810> place<00:05:10.990> did<00:05:11.259> it<00:05:11.380> very

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this but I think the place did it very

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.219 
this but I think the place did it very
well<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.830> think<00:05:12.240> we<00:05:13.240> kept<00:05:13.449> them<00:05:13.630> outside<00:05:14.020> or

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
well I think we kept them outside or

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.260 
well I think we kept them outside or
penalty<00:05:14.740> box<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.310> created<00:05:15.729> real<00:05:15.940> some

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
penalty box and we created real some

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.879 
penalty box and we created real some
really<00:05:16.570> good<00:05:16.720> goalscoring<00:05:17.259> chances<00:05:17.470> they

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
really good goalscoring chances they

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.920 
really good goalscoring chances they
have<00:05:18.039> some<00:05:18.310> shots<00:05:18.729> on<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:19.120> from<00:05:19.449> distance

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
have some shots on this from distance

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.439 
have some shots on this from distance
but<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.560> think<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.370> was<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.520> fair<00:05:21.639> result<00:05:21.970> on<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
but I think it was a fair result on the

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.080 
but I think it was a fair result on the
way<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.780> think<00:05:23.440> we<00:05:23.500> played<00:05:23.680> well<00:05:24.009> today<00:05:24.190> much

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
way I think we played well today much

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.659 
way I think we played well today much
better<00:05:25.120> than<00:05:25.449> we<00:05:25.600> did<00:05:25.720> against<00:05:25.930> trinidad

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
better than we did against trinidad

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.890 
better than we did against trinidad
unfortunately<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.759> same<00:05:27.940> problem<00:05:28.150> we<00:05:28.660> can't

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
unfortunately the same problem we can't

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.350 
unfortunately the same problem we can't
we<00:05:29.530> can't<00:05:29.710> score<00:05:30.009> we<00:05:30.789> create<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> lot<00:05:31.210> of

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
we can't score we create a lot of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.879 
we can't score we create a lot of
chances<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:32.259> course<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.560> get<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.710> bit

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
chances and of course you get a bit

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.490 
chances and of course you get a bit
worried<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:33.600> in<00:05:34.600> DM<00:05:34.840> we<00:05:34.990> scored<00:05:35.289> and

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
worried but in DM we scored and

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.689 
worried but in DM we scored and
hopefully<00:05:35.830> now<00:05:35.949> and<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.220> rest<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.520> goals
