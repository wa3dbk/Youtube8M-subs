00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.710
More than two years residents of only the one village

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.255
massively sleep for several days,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.700
and no one can understand why.

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.164
Until January 40 villagers Kalachi asleep in broad daylight.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.780
Chief physician of the hospital Cabrashit Almagametov: "Typical Clinic, as well as in other cases:

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.680
lethargy, drowsiness, double vision, disturbance of moving."

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.104
The fact that local doctors explained as typical pattern

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.930
but for scientists - unexplained anomaly, an enigma!

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.160
To solve the mystery of the sleeping village try and outside of Kazakhstan.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:32.995
It`s too unusual story but not unique in the world.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.000
A journalist asks a sleepy woman: "Have you ever received? Yesterday?"

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.760
A resident of the village Natalia Zhavaronkova answers: "It is said to me that yesterday but it seems to me - today."

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.640
To recall all facts Natalia Zhavaronkova not even trying.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.420
In deep sleep she fell straight while fishing.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.315
For the second time in three months.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.298
And such as it is - an entire village.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.940
Russia's chief doctor of the Sleep Medicine Center Natalia Belinskaya: "It can randomly fall and fall asleep anywhere,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.640
in any position of the body. It can be a minute, it can be 30 minutes or more."

00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:04.074
Therefore, experts have put forward a different version.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.560
Somnology expert Michael Polouektov: "The most unusual in this story, of course,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.000
is that they after sleeping does not unhealthy.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.660
Medicine knows a little of these states,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.560
so it begs the question, is not this a manifestation of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.820
any form of mass trance, mass hysteria, if may say so. "

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.540
The reason of mental disorder, according to the doctors, it may be depression

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.040
feel constantly villagers.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.580
Earlier in this village Kalachi mined uranium.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.220
Now all the mines closed, there is no work, people leave this place.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.700
 It is in these closed uranium mines need to search answers,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.820
says Russian Professor Leonid Rikhvanov from Tomsk.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.980
According to him after the flooding of mines on the surface began to climb the decay product of uranium - gas radon.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.780
Professor of the Department of Environmental Geoscience and geochemistry of Tomsk Polytechnic University Leonid Rikhvanov: "The gas that induce toxic effect

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.220
will drive a person in this dream state,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.920
and the person falls asleep. 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.960
 Relatives of radon from the chemical table of Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.620
- xenon, krypton, argon and others -

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.220
- were known in medicine for pain relief during surgeries."

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860
Conventional methods of measurement of radiation to determine

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.540
 the status of radon in the air is extremely difficult, said the scientist.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.540
Therefore, previous studies have shown nothing.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.560
Without waiting for the mystery disease will be revealed, 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.280
Kazakh authorities intend to completely resettle the village elsewhere.
