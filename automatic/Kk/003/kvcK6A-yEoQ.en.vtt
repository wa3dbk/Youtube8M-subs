00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:11.650
I think we have come out of the era in which
fat was demonized as the bad macronutrient,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.389
but that legacy is still very much with us.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.500
I still see when people give nutritional advice,
talking about weight control, I still see

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.061
the emphasis on fatty foods and people talking
about high-fat foods and cutting down on fat

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.090
consumption and low-fat foods.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.260
Fat does not make you fat.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.250
This is a very important concept - fat does
not make you fat.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.300
What is driving the obesity epidemic in this
country is the very high consumption of high-glycemic

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
load carbohydrate foods which have been technically
manipulated.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.780
We need fat in the diet and you can have substantial
amounts of fat in the diet.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.750
When you try to lower fat - when you get below
25 percent of calories - food rapidly gets

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.080
uninteresting.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.260
Fat is the major conveyor of flavor to us
because many of the flavor principles are

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.040
fat-soluble, fat also gives a pleasurable
mouth feel.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
If you try to get fat down in the range of
10 percent of calories, which Ornish and Pritikin

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
diets have recommended, I don't think people
are going to stay on that unless you have

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
a chef living with you or you live at a spa
or you are so frightened about the prospect

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.600
of an invasive cardiac procedure that you
are going to do that.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.460
That is very difficult to eat food like that
and it is not necessary.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.840
In the Ornish program, where he has demonstrated
reversal of heart disease, he has never studied

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.560
the dietary component apart from the other
components of the program, which includes

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.660
moderate exercise, meditation, and group support.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.890
I think if you gave a Mediterranean diet or
the anti-inflammatory diet as part of that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.700
same program, you would get better results
and better compliance.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.689
On the island of Crete, one of the stellar
areas for traditional Mediterranean diet,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.360
people eat 40 percent of calories as fat and
they have very low rates of cardiovascular

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.379
disease and cancer.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.170
The fat that they are mostly eating is olive
oil, fat from fish, and fat from high-quality

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890
whole-fat dairy products.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.950
The fact is we need fat and the most important
kinds of fats that we need are the essential

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.340
fatty acids and here is another area, which
there has been an explosion of research.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.459
We must have omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids
everyday and we have to have them in the right

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.569
ratio.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.890
It has been estimated that in Paleolithic
times, we are eating these two categories

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.940
of fats in roughly equal quantities.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.540
Now we are eating a tremendous excess of omega-6
fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.310
There are many reasons for that: one is that
omega-3 sources are very rare in nature - it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.349
is mostly from oily fish.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.380
The vegetable sources of omega-3s you cannot
really count on for your omega-3 needs because

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.379
they are a short chain form ALA which the
body has to convert to DHA and EPA.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:10.330
That conversion is inefficient at best and
it varies greatly depending on your genetics

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.849
and it is interfered with if there are a lot
of omega-6 fatty acids in the diet.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.400
The main reason for the imbalance at present
is that our diets have been flooded with new

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.950
sources of omega-6 fatty acids.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.920
The main one is refined soybean oil which
began to enter the food chain here in the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
1920s.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.780
It is the universal fat that is used in processed,
manufactured technological-manipulated food.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.409
It is ubiquitous because it is cheap.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.730
It is cheap because the government artificially
drives down the price of soy through subsidy

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.140
programs.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.040
The introduction of refined soybean oil has
been the major reason for this tremendous

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.120
imbalance in omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.500
This has huge consequences in terms of inflammatory
status.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.760
I usually tell people to avoid any food product
with soybean oil as an ingredient - that is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.819
a marker of low-quality food.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.120
This, by the way, is one of the things when
we get political and hopefully in the public

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.590
forum, we should all be working immediately
to end these federal subsidies to soy and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.209
corn which are responsible for making some
of the unhealthiest ingredients in our food,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.970
cheapest and most available - this is something
that has to be stopped.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.419
Another reason, which is less obvious for
the increased consumption of omega-6 fatty

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.809
acids, is that the animals that we raised
for meat were grazing animals that typically

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.870
ate grasses not too long in the past.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.439
Grasses have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids
in them and cows eat tremendous amounts of

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.779
them, so they build up omega-3 fatty acids
in their fat.

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:52.169
Now we fatten our cows on grains which are
omega-6 sources so that omega-3 source has

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.919
disappeared and been replaced by an omega-6
source.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.960
This is the fact that people are eating a
tremendous disparity of omega-6 fatty acids

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.190
to omega-3 fatty acids.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.460
That is one of the most serious nutritional
problems in our population is insufficient

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.779
omega-3 intake.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:16.000
Huge consequences in terms of risks of chronic
disease related to inflammation.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.680
I strongly recommend using extra virgin olive
oil as a main fat.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.159
The research on olive oil is terrific and
not only does olive oil have a very good fatty

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:33.050
acid profile, it has a unique fraction of
health protective antioxidants - polyphenols,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.759
which are related to the polyphenols found
in green tea and in other natural products.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.689
This fraction is delicate and easily damaged
by oxidation so this is a reason to get good

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.409
quality extra virgin olive oil, to store it
properly and not to let it be exposed to light

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.369
or air, and not heat it to too high temperatures.

00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:01.990
An interesting compound that has been found
in that fraction is called oleocanthal.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.999
It is responsible for the peppery, biting
taste of good olive oil and it has been shown

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:14.539
to have anti-inflammatory power equal to that
of ibuprofen - that is remarkable.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:26.210
I have attended some olive oil tastings in
Italy 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.219
and I had never done olive oil tasting before
and it is interesting to do this - you put

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:35.219
olive oil onto a spoon and you slurp it into
your mouth mixing it with a lot of air and

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.360
coat your mouth with it, then spit it out.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.590
When you are at olive oil tastings, you hear
a lot of coughing, and good olive oils at

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:52.779
the very end of the taste often give you a
catch in the throat and sometimes make people

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.779
cough.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.800
Some people experience this as a peppery bite
and that is very desirable and is the mark

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.379
of a good olive oil where this polyphenol
fraction has not been damaged and you want

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.719
that in your diet.

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:10.319
Basically, you want to get people to not be
afraid of fat.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.749
I think whole-fat dairy products are much
healthier than non-fat or low-fat dairy products

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:17.559
and they taste better.

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:24.580
I think that one of the great practical problems
that came from this era of demonization of

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.770
fat was that there was a proliferation of
low-fat and non-fat foods on the market, which

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.349
had even higher glycemic loads than the conventional
versions of those.

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:39.660
Often, to make up for the reduction in taste
and pleasure by taking fat out, people put

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.679
more sugar in.

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:47.369
Just looking at what happened during this
era, Americans got fatter as they ate more

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:50.219
and more low-fat and non-fat foods, they got
fatter.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.799
Something was very wrong with the way we were
thinking.
