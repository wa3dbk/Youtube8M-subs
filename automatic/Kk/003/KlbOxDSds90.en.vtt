 although it seems like the whole world nowadays only convinced him with 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:06.950
 we could do a lot of talk there are always new netbooks on the market we have 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.809
 two new dazs typical 12 15 and the sansoni pain and sorrow prefer yes it 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.730
 his two must be new models and then 12 15 which looks very much like that you have 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.699
 Twelve hundred that ball in goal is an inactive second TV 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.970
 combining memory with video clips this year is a big one 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.069
 complete books are as 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:31.089
 13 66 7 68 he screen resolution therefore closer jan it is a whole 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.289
 premature or financial year actually herxing almost doesn't want to be a fun book 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.400
 use that two gigabytes of memory 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.609
 and because of that, a processor with a good proposal could not be one of them 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.420
 and windows 7 home premium basically everything you need from a small one too 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.339
 still waiting but we have had it all before and the right thing 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.480
 things the real one isn't very good at 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.420
 also other financial sector wonderfully deceased by the fiod play on the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.630
 things are just fine 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.540
 because just in the even years i have you the video card takes over yes very 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.990
 much nxt for honest loose video card traineeship that those just four 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.460
 basic players connected 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 Ritchie proposals 18 has an official one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.240
 yes it is a great machine to take with you wherever you go 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030
 to the west after one and a half kilos 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.690
 and this may be the one I participated in it is not the most complicated 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.520
 Christmas market 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 if you compare that to an ordinary book where yes vdl for a challenge 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.250
 is 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.430
 and yes that is not a problem for this device should I myself have 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.710
 there is no difference between 10.012 in zwolle sounds like made vs but that is anyway 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.990
 to live considerably 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 if you already get started then only if your web browser opens with a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 privilege that feeling 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.630
 from windows from multiple sides miss that I am very sorry but I had that too 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 how funny this second album of the year is with those typical ones 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 it is of course just about the resolution 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.310
 because that is the designated riders who on 19 of van sometimes because that is there 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 new a little bent that are what they now have on some models 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.490
 is also through on a number but also at school is only a few seconds 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.440
 festival fairs yes yes it is all very nice luxury but the special 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.610
 of this and the book is that it is equipped with a bat screen that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 Ministers of Sunna have Netbooks but also to the Playstation 3 6 6 7 68 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.989
 was just as much as on this rider as typical and also as much as on 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.030
 very changes coming and that makes and then ff for usable than what you 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.780
 normally with a netbook the sentiment was still with a thousand children 600 yes me 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.790
 feel the foot with me always a little bit upside down everyone that one 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 bit so just love it all nonsense the singer is a window of it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.850
 program because then you fit he is pretty close to normal patients 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.459
 with procedures at 1024 to 600 must set yes and then you notice again until 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.430
 tumult website and the bandidos option only want programs that works off 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.990
 just too 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.349
 Rome in years It can all be years if you like the daily ones 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.920
 to work or do some simple things with it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 yes then but not then it is fine 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.810
 but about thirty 66 screen years I think that is really an enormous added value on such 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 device like this 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.520
 4 yes and the funny thing is that this is a machine that is based on that new one 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.270
 dualcore ets leur and five 50 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.240
 and then has a gigabyte of memory yes it is a lot more compact if you then 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.430
 A solid on the map to see you really the difference between the two is the one 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.950
 decent yes voice hear cup encounter between those two he puts a wimp yeah 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.090
 and then you make it to be a lot smaller indeed yes I know I can feel that way 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.510
 propose 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.920
 what a lot of ladies are immediately looking forward to this 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.410
 but that is a very nice compact model yes yes and you do notice that anyway 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.439
 if you are on the road very often, yes, then the has more 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.150
 preference if you can then live with the bike yes I have slightly smaller screen 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.199
 then it is interesting option there are a few targeted 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.259
 in terms of weight that is very large, one and a half kilos of kara swisher san francisco 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.939
 income 25 pounds 4 but something from it they use animals that are on ahead and on 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.369
 the n from 50 million 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.119
 and ddr three memory 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 but that you have a piece of theme 31 50 from intel 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.010
 in terms of graphic possibilities, that is not the thing that makes you very happy 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.009
 is becoming 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:01.029
 This is who likes supersession we put upright and denmark 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.789
 score 168 after 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:04.949
 that is possible with the score but he 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.949
 everyone can go to each other as your hands 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:12.799
 and if you don't ask for anything more about this thing, then that's on graphic 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.109
 area just my best for challenge so if its really a bit like you 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.470
 right hand really videos no watch how it should and then still has 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.870
 such a thing with that boy a bit preferred and would you like good 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.700
 I'm really going to do some test work with a little bit of competition 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.230
 multimedia happens then 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.760
 instance is more interesting 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.130
 but funny is property anp ak is on the battery life 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.860
 that's strange 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.749
 yes two I think yes there are both of them 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.749
 the couple will halve this top four and a half hours 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.840
 this is at about four o'clock the vvd that or a second kolhoff obviously there that 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.419
 that almost all is interchangeable, yes, it actually disappoints me a bit 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.250
 to mention samsom marketing on site marketing also scored much better 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.059
 Of course you have to adjust your figure next to it 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.900
 yes i think if you turn the light off 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.300
 in peru a church bell impression that you could undoubtedly make it, yes but in 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.300
 the practice year out whether they are good intensive users 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.470
 you can be happy with the machine repeated four to six hours with the device 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.270
 but perhaps a short while back to the tablets from the introduction country 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.460
 I was also two weeks ago the news that adults 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.319
 the americans quite a victory 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.939
 that netbooks sales had fallen nearly 5 percent now with all of those 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:21.830
 tablets 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.069
 the incidents about these things are the big market 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.559
 i think the market i think this is a hugely interesting alternative to 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.470
 a copper and lead book 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.170
 you can of course for four and a half 100 euros 15 is easy open and you have that 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.010
 working baker who himself looks at such a huge device how your backpack yes 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.120
 this is a this is a perfect alternative if you keep it at home and 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.320
 most beautiful fashion city to share with a little and then opt for body asus to 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.920
 On the way a bit out of my bed or on the internet 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.860
 bank can use the internet a bit because it is fine and if it is pure 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.510
 not so much about it because it has the multimedia happening you will be quite 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.159
 interesting 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.139
 and also if you look at price tag if you compare that with some 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.710
 tablets 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.879
 look this costs has a suggested retail price of 399 euros 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.120
 and he is now slowly coming to the market I think they think the price is 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.969
 Slightly going down we see very low prices but I wonder if 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:14.879
 that completely 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:19.759
 colet but between 350 and 400 euros it will cost and those aces 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.739
 since about half an hour there must have been a whole for years 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:26.709
 earder device my hands and certainly year two greek couches must have written 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:30.360
 we plan is great alternative to the common man yes 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.539
 absolutely 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.939
 come to that conclusion that the end of this episode has heart over the weeks 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.030
 for week friday like every week there is again we are talking about this
