good<00:00:12.090> everyone<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.830> suppose<00:00:14.160> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
good everyone this is the I suppose you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.160 
good everyone this is the I suppose you
could<00:00:14.429> call<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.759> build<00:00:15.000> rapport<00:00:15.450> for<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> time

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
could call it build rapport for the time

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
could call it build rapport for the time
pad<00:00:16.500> power<00:00:17.010> supply<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.760> showed<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> quick<00:00:18.570> demo

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
pad power supply I showed a quick demo

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.890 
pad power supply I showed a quick demo
of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.980> night<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.939> its<00:00:21.180> noise<00:00:21.390> filtering

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
of the night of its noise filtering

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
of the night of its noise filtering
capabilities<00:00:22.680> also<00:00:23.100> said<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> cost<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.939> $15

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
capabilities also said it cost about $15

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
capabilities also said it cost about $15
I'm<00:00:25.320> thinking<00:00:25.740> about<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.039> actually<00:00:26.670> was

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I'm thinking about it actually was

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.359 
I'm thinking about it actually was
probably<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.840> less<00:00:28.019> than<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.349> maybe<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
probably a bit less than that maybe it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
probably a bit less than that maybe it
could<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.849> another<00:00:30.510> under<00:00:31.050> 10<00:00:31.289> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
could actually be another under 10 and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
could actually be another under 10 and
build<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.610> done<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.390> which<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.840> um<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
build I've done to now which was um the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
build I've done to now which was um the
first<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.219> building<00:00:36.030> effect<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.510> under

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
first one was building effect for under

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
first one was building effect for under
$10<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.739> built<00:00:38.070> an<00:00:38.250> amp<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
$10 and then I actually built an amp a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.709 
$10 and then I actually built an amp a
little<00:00:39.570> mini<00:00:39.780> amp<00:00:39.989> 1<00:00:40.770> watt<00:00:41.010> power<00:00:41.670> amp<00:00:42.000> for

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
little mini amp 1 watt power amp for

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
little mini amp 1 watt power amp for
under<00:00:43.110> $10<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.739> hour<00:00:43.860> built<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.250> power<00:00:44.550> supply

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
under $10 an hour built a power supply

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.690 
under $10 an hour built a power supply
for<00:00:44.940> under<00:00:45.180> $10<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> build<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.550> you're

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
for under $10 so to build this you're

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.930 
for under $10 so to build this you're
going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> need<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.329> power<00:00:48.750> supply<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
going to need a power supply and and you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
going to need a power supply and and you
can<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.390> old<00:00:51.629> power<00:00:52.079> supply<00:00:52.469> like

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
can just use any old power supply like

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.119 
can just use any old power supply like
this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.640> instance<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.680> one<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> net

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this is for instance a one from a net

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.119 
this is for instance a one from a net
gear<00:00:56.600> switch<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.930> had<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> work<00:00:58.410> an<00:00:58.620> old<00:00:58.800> switch

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
gear switch we had it work an old switch

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.779 
gear switch we had it work an old switch
and<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.329> 12<00:01:00.750> volts<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.440> amp<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.460> pay

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and it's 12 volts one amp just pay

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
and it's 12 volts one amp just pay
attention<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> polarity<00:01:04.350> though<00:01:04.530> because

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
attention to the polarity though because

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.670 
attention to the polarity though because
when<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> wire<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.210> input<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
when you wire up the input you have to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
when you wire up the input you have to
make<00:01:07.799> sure<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> Y<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> around<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
make sure that you Y that around the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
make sure that you Y that around the
right<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.270> otherwise<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> be

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
right way otherwise you're going to be

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
right way otherwise you're going to be
feeding<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.799> negative<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> positive<00:01:11.280> around

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
feeding the negative and positive around

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
feeding the negative and positive around
the<00:01:11.939> wrong<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.270> yeah<00:01:12.990> pay<00:01:13.409> attention<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the wrong way so yeah pay attention to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
the wrong way so yeah pay attention to
the<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.200> diagram

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the to the you know the little diagram

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.560 
the to the you know the little diagram
they<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> tip<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.119> connect<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
they have of what the tip is connect to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
they have of what the tip is connect to
and<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> barrel<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.710> connected

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and what the barrel is connected

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
and what the barrel is connected
connected<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.390> obviously<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> output

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
connected to and obviously on the output

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
connected to and obviously on the output
of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> thing<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of the thing you have it the way the the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
of the thing you have it the way the the
boss<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> plus<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
boss way which is the plus on the on the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.950 
boss way which is the plus on the on the
barrel<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> negative<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> tip<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
barrel and the negative on the tip so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
barrel and the negative on the tip so
I'm<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.619> time<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.280> days<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> didn't

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I'm a bit time for these days I didn't

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.249 
I'm a bit time for these days I didn't
give<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> powder<00:01:30.420> coating<00:01:30.810> job<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.110> anything

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
give it a powder coating job or anything

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
give it a powder coating job or anything
fancy<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.890> gave<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> roughs<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
fancy you just gave it a roughs and I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
fancy you just gave it a roughs and I
gave<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> bit<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> brushed<00:01:34.049> aluminium

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
gave it a bit of a brushed aluminium

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830 
gave it a bit of a brushed aluminium
look<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:35.939> looks<00:01:36.090> pretty<00:01:36.299> cool<00:01:36.570> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
look which actually looks pretty cool if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
look which actually looks pretty cool if
I<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.049> done<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.500> properly<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.490> sort

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I had done it properly and not just sort

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.749 
I had done it properly and not just sort
of<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.299> half-assed<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.100> you're

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
of you know half-assed it and you're

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
of you know half-assed it and you're
obviously<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.780> clear<00:01:43.020> coat<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
obviously going to want a clear coat it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
obviously going to want a clear coat it
to<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> scratches<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.399> easily<00:01:45.200> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to because it scratches really easily so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.460 
to because it scratches really easily so
let's<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:46.770> inside

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.050 

I'm<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.680> sure<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.070> isn't<00:01:53.220> meant<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> go

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I'm pretty sure this isn't meant to go

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.840 
I'm pretty sure this isn't meant to go
into<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> 1598<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.040> boy<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.490> looked<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
into a 1598 but the boy just looked like

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.620 
into a 1598 but the boy just looked like
it<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.930> wanted<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.650> in<00:01:58.830> there<00:01:59.010> so<00:01:59.310> um

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
it just just wanted to go in there so um

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.710 
it just just wanted to go in there so um
yeah<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.900> made<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.260> happen<00:02:02.090> also<00:02:03.090> forgot<00:02:03.690> to

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
yeah just made it happen also forgot to

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.540 
yeah just made it happen also forgot to
mention<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> power<00:02:04.530> supply<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
mention with the power supply to

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.109 
mention with the power supply to
actually<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.960> time<00:02:07.650> pad<00:02:07.920> power<00:02:08.789> supply

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
actually this time pad power supply

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.530 
actually this time pad power supply
board<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.600> actually<00:02:09.750> meant<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.540> 12

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
board is actually meant to have a 12

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.190 
board is actually meant to have a 12
volt<00:02:12.770> AC<00:02:13.770> input<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.840> actually<00:02:16.140> got

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
volt AC input and and it's actually got

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.260 
volt AC input and and it's actually got
a<00:02:16.260> rectifier<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.070> board<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> one

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
a rectifier on the board this is the one

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.900 
a rectifier on the board this is the one
that<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.050> power<00:02:19.260> supply<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:19.650> using<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.010> DC<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
that the power supply I'm using is DC so

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.550 
that the power supply I'm using is DC so
you<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.120> leave<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> rectifier<00:02:21.990> off<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you just leave the rectifier off and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.070 
you just leave the rectifier off and
that's<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.420> four<00:02:24.660> diode

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
that's just the for the four diode

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.260 
that's just the for the four diode
bridge<00:02:25.320> at<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.040> start<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.550> circuit<00:02:26.970> just

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
bridge at the start of the circuit just

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.290 
bridge at the start of the circuit just
leave<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.660> off<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.530> tap<00:02:28.800> in

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
leave that off and just just tap in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.699 
leave that off and just just tap in
pretty<00:02:30.300> much<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.690> point<00:02:30.959> after<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
pretty much on the point after that and

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.030 
pretty much on the point after that and
you'll<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.340> fine<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.360> heatsink<00:02:34.110> goes<00:02:34.800> onto

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you'll be fine that heatsink goes onto

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.300 
you'll be fine that heatsink goes onto
the<00:02:35.370> power<00:02:35.820> regulator<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.920> does<00:02:38.130> get

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the power regulator and and it does get

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.030 
the power regulator and and it does get
warm<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.870> used<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.739> tone<00:02:41.070> pad<00:02:41.430> sorry<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.270> Teta

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
warm and I used a tone pad sorry a Teta

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
warm and I used a tone pad sorry a Teta
heatsink<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.420> cut<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.630> down<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> size

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
heatsink and I just cut it down to size

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.310 
heatsink and I just cut it down to size
with<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.620> um<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> hacksaw<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.510> pretty<00:02:49.110> it's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
with a um with a hacksaw a pretty it's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.900 
with a um with a hacksaw a pretty it's
just<00:02:49.530> our<00:02:49.650> mininum<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.160> pretty<00:02:50.400> easy<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.670> cut

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
just our mininum it's pretty easy to cut

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.479 
just our mininum it's pretty easy to cut
through<00:02:51.209> with<00:02:52.050> these<00:02:52.230> DC<00:02:52.770> jacks<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.250> don't

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
through with these DC jacks you don't

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.610 
through with these DC jacks you don't
have<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.090> use<00:02:54.299> four<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> them<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.200> should<00:02:55.530> have

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
have to use four of them I should have

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
have to use four of them I should have
checked<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.459> schematic<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
checked this the schematic and the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
checked this the schematic and the
layout<00:02:57.330> before<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.840> actually<00:02:57.959> built<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
layout before I actually built it you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190 
layout before I actually built it you
could<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.580> use<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.209> because<00:03:00.600> they're<00:03:01.049> all

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
could just use one because they're all

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.000 
could just use one because they're all
in<00:03:01.350> serial<00:03:01.830> anyway<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> DC

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
in serial anyway so just get a DC

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.470 
in serial anyway so just get a DC
daisy-chain<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.400> enough<00:03:05.700> connectors

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
daisy-chain that's got enough connectors

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.060 
daisy-chain that's got enough connectors
on<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.200> know<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.320> ten<00:03:07.769> or<00:03:07.920> whatever

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
on it you know like ten or whatever

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.130 
on it you know like ten or whatever
however<00:03:08.850> many<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.420> need<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.840> use<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
however many you need and just use that

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.259 
however many you need and just use that
instead<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.950> having<00:03:11.130> these<00:03:11.310> four<00:03:11.610> individual

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
instead of having these four individual

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.610 
instead of having these four individual
or<00:03:13.019> five<00:03:13.410> sorry<00:03:13.860> he's<00:03:14.010> got<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.580> layout

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
or five sorry he's got on the layout

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.199 
or five sorry he's got on the layout
individual<00:03:16.620> sockets<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.910> bit<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
individual sockets it's just a bit of a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.960 
individual sockets it's just a bit of a
pain<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> bum<00:03:19.200> trying<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.769> drill<00:03:20.700> all

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
pain in the bum trying to drill all

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.400 
pain in the bum trying to drill all
these<00:03:21.120> holes<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> put<00:03:22.230> all<00:03:22.320> these

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
these holes and you know put all these

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.020 
these holes and you know put all these
DC<00:03:22.860> Jackson<00:03:23.340> when<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:23.850> use<00:03:24.000> one

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
DC Jackson when you can just use one

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.140 
DC Jackson when you can just use one
daisy<00:03:24.840> chain<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:26.400> would<00:03:26.489> also<00:03:26.610> save<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> bit

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
daisy chain so it would also save a bit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.580 
daisy chain so it would also save a bit
of<00:03:27.209> space<00:03:27.420> here<00:03:27.690> too<00:03:27.870> because<00:03:27.989> they've<00:03:28.350> got

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
of space here too because they've got

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.620 
of space here too because they've got
that<00:03:28.769> definitely<00:03:29.130> got<00:03:29.280> very<00:03:30.000> crowded<00:03:30.540> around

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that definitely got very crowded around

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.340 
that definitely got very crowded around

so<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.120> need<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.360> separate<00:03:48.780> those<00:03:49.100> separate

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
so you need to separate those separate

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.620 
so you need to separate those separate
the<00:03:50.190> heatsink<00:03:50.549> from<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.790> ground<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.570> know

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
the heatsink from the ground and I know

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.539 
the heatsink from the ground and I know
people<00:03:52.530> probably<00:03:52.650> say<00:03:52.920> all<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.160> tape<00:03:53.430> is

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
people probably say all that tape is

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.819 
people probably say all that tape is
going<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> insulate<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.290> heatsink<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:55.470> just

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
going to insulate the heatsink but just

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.890 
going to insulate the heatsink but just
got<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.130> tight<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.579> just<00:03:56.760> had<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.970> use<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.390> tried

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
got so tight I just had to use it tried

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.830 
got so tight I just had to use it tried
to<00:03:57.930> leave<00:03:58.230> some<00:03:58.860> some<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.700> off<00:03:59.879> but<00:04:00.209> yeah<00:04:00.450> in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
to leave some some of it off but yeah in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.140 
to leave some some of it off but yeah in
it<00:04:00.989> at<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> end<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.160> day<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> still

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it at the end of the day I still

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.670 
it at the end of the day I still
to<00:04:03.269> put<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.629> on<00:04:03.750> because<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.170> better<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.530> have

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
to put it on because it's better to have

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.710 
to put it on because it's better to have
a<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.430> know<00:04:05.549> slightly<00:04:05.879> warmer<00:04:06.299> heat<00:04:06.450> sink

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
a you know slightly warmer heat sink

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.619 
a you know slightly warmer heat sink
than<00:04:06.930> am<00:04:07.230> heating<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.769> touch<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.220> ground

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
than am heating this touch and ground

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.789 
than am heating this touch and ground
and<00:04:09.629> you've<00:04:09.930> also<00:04:10.079> got<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.439> connect<00:04:10.709> the

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
and you've also got to connect the

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.399 
and you've also got to connect the
ground<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.370> just<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.760> point<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.959> I've<00:04:13.230> just

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
ground to just one point and I've just

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.619 
ground to just one point and I've just
gone<00:04:13.739> off<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.189> bit<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.519> wire<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.060> wrapped

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
gone off with a bit of wire and wrapped

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.249 
gone off with a bit of wire and wrapped
it<00:04:15.780> around<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.199> UM<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.329> nut<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.630> DC

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
it around the UM the the nut of the DC

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.409 
it around the UM the the nut of the DC
Jack<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.769> input<00:04:20.100> DC<00:04:20.280> Jack<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:20.970> then<00:04:21.030> tighten

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
Jack the input DC Jack and then tighten

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.340 
Jack the input DC Jack and then tighten
the<00:04:21.570> tighten<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.380> nut<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.669> hold<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.350> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
hold the ground wire on to the enclosure

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.020 
hold the ground wire on to the enclosure
I<00:04:27.960> don't<00:04:28.139> know<00:04:28.199> how<00:04:28.289> anyone<00:04:28.500> else<00:04:28.710> did<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.340> or

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
I don't know how anyone else did it or

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.510 
I don't know how anyone else did it or
does<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.479> that's<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:30.780> how<00:04:31.050> I've<00:04:31.229> done<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
does it that's just how I've done it and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.850 
does it that's just how I've done it and
yeah<00:04:33.270> that's<00:04:33.479> pretty<00:04:33.539> much<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.110> if<00:04:34.680> you

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
yeah that's pretty much it so if you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.010 
yeah that's pretty much it so if you
leave<00:04:35.070> off<00:04:35.280> if<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:35.789> only<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:36.060> one<00:04:36.330> DC<00:04:36.780> jack

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
leave off if you only have one DC jack

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.090 
leave off if you only have one DC jack
on<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.260> end<00:04:37.440> here<00:04:37.620> you'd<00:04:37.740> have<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.949> worry

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
on the end here you'd have to worry

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.920 
on the end here you'd have to worry
about<00:04:38.250> these<00:04:38.490> three<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.389> be<00:04:39.510> able<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> fit<00:04:39.840> it

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
about these three you be able to fit it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110 
about these three you be able to fit it
in<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.500> much<00:04:40.770> easier<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.160> just<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.789> so<00:04:42.000> much

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
in so much easier you just have so much

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.050 
in so much easier you just have so much
room<00:04:42.419> it'll<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:42.960> ridiculous<00:04:43.560> but<00:04:43.740> because<00:04:44.160> I'd

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
room it'll be ridiculous but because I'd

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.400 
room it'll be ridiculous but because I'd
already<00:04:45.210> drilled<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.630> holes<00:04:45.840> out<00:04:46.020> before<00:04:46.380> I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
already drilled the holes out before I

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.200 
already drilled the holes out before I
realize<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.949> were<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.130> Syria<00:04:47.550> in

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
realize that they were in Syria in

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.950 
realize that they were in Syria in
theory<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:49.430> yeah<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.460> ended<00:04:50.639> up<00:04:50.850> sort<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.330> well<00:04:51.810> I

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
theory so yeah I ended up sort of well I

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.600 
theory so yeah I ended up sort of well I
just<00:04:52.020> filled<00:04:52.530> them<00:04:52.680> pretty<00:04:53.010> much<00:04:53.190> just<00:04:53.460> so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
just filled them pretty much just so

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.920 
just filled them pretty much just so
that<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.789> didn't<00:04:54.120> have<00:04:54.210> holes<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:54.599> the<00:04:54.690> front

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
that I didn't have holes on the front

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.080 
that I didn't have holes on the front
but<00:04:55.139> yeah<00:04:55.349> you<00:04:55.710> don't<00:04:55.800> need<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.070> do<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.400> you

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
but yeah you don't need to do that you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.670 
but yeah you don't need to do that you
can<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.330> four<00:04:57.599> daisy<00:04:57.840> chains<00:04:58.229> coming<00:04:58.590> off

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
can have four daisy chains coming off

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.409 
can have four daisy chains coming off
that<00:04:58.830> at<00:04:58.949> least<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.250> guess<00:04:59.460> probably<00:05:00.210> one

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
that at least I guess probably one

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.620 
that at least I guess probably one
advantage<00:05:00.930> um<00:05:01.550> yeah<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.729> it's<00:05:03.060> adjustable

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
advantage um yeah and it's adjustable

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.360 
advantage um yeah and it's adjustable
too<00:05:03.900> as<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.110> trim<00:05:04.410> pot<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.770> can<00:05:04.889> adjust<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
too as a trim pot you can adjust the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.310 
too as a trim pot you can adjust the
output<00:05:05.400> think<00:05:06.060> I've<00:05:06.180> got<00:05:06.330> mine<00:05:06.509> on<00:05:06.750> about<00:05:07.139> nine

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
output think I've got mine on about nine

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.129 
output think I've got mine on about nine
point<00:05:07.680> three<00:05:07.740> volts<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:09.120> I've<00:05:09.270> also<00:05:09.449> seen<00:05:09.810> it

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
point three volts and I've also seen it

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.320 
point three volts and I've also seen it
unplug<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.870> multimeter<00:05:12.870> into<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.610> output<00:05:15.030> of

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
unplug the multimeter into the output of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.300 
unplug the multimeter into the output of
this<00:05:15.630> thing<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.050> put<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.410> into<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> punch<00:05:17.039> amp

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
this thing and put it into the punch amp

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.580 
this thing and put it into the punch amp
up<00:05:17.520> really<00:05:18.150> loud<00:05:18.360> which<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.169> punch<00:05:19.380> EV

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
up really loud which the the punch EV

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.580 
up really loud which the the punch EV
sucks<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.310> current<00:05:20.639> big<00:05:20.849> time<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.409> didn't

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
sucks the current big time and I didn't

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.060 
sucks the current big time and I didn't
notice

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
notice

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.159 
notice
I<00:05:23.099> noticed<00:05:23.580> think<00:05:23.760> about<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:23.970> point<00:05:24.599> one<00:05:24.840> volt

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
I noticed think about a point one volt

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.029 
I noticed think about a point one volt
of<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.440> volt<00:05:25.699> drop<00:05:26.699> which<00:05:26.909> is<00:05:26.940> pretty<00:05:27.240> good<00:05:27.510> I

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
of a volt drop which is pretty good I

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.460 
of a volt drop which is pretty good I
mean<00:05:29.039> that<00:05:29.190> thing<00:05:29.460> when<00:05:29.639> it's<00:05:29.789> on<00:05:29.940> full<00:05:30.180> blast

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
mean that thing when it's on full blast

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.040 
mean that thing when it's on full blast
can<00:05:31.470> pretty<00:05:32.039> much<00:05:32.220> turn<00:05:32.520> pedals<00:05:33.030> off<00:05:33.180> with<00:05:33.870> my

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
can pretty much turn pedals off with my

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.649 
can pretty much turn pedals off with my
other<00:05:34.229> power<00:05:34.620> supply<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.820> yeah<00:05:36.510> it's

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
other power supply so so yeah it's

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.570 
other power supply so so yeah it's
pretty<00:05:36.810> good<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.139> this<00:05:37.320> doesn't<00:05:37.590> do<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:37.979> so

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
pretty good that this doesn't do that so

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.820 
pretty good that this doesn't do that so
that's<00:05:38.760> pretty<00:05:38.909> much<00:05:39.060> it<00:05:39.300> for<00:05:39.780> this<00:05:40.169> sort<00:05:40.770> of

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
that's pretty much it for this sort of

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.969 
that's pretty much it for this sort of
build<00:05:41.070> report<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.669> of<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.030> power<00:05:42.270> filter

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
build report of the of the power filter

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.260 
build report of the of the power filter
it's<00:05:43.979> one<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.550> those<00:05:44.639> things<00:05:44.909> in<00:05:45.030> me<00:05:45.090> if<00:05:45.180> you've

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
it's one of those things in me if you've

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.550 
it's one of those things in me if you've
got<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.389> 12<00:05:45.630> volt<00:05:45.960> DC<00:05:47.120> power<00:05:48.120> power<00:05:49.050> pack<00:05:49.260> lying

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
got a 12 volt DC power power pack lying

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.800 
got a 12 volt DC power power pack lying
around<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.400> can<00:05:50.430> build<00:05:50.760> one<00:05:50.970> and<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.210> you<00:05:51.690> know

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
around you can build one and in you know

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.870 
around you can build one and in you know
you'll<00:05:52.260> know<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.740> does<00:05:52.919> a<00:05:52.949> does<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.550> fairly

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
you'll know that it does a does a fairly

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.260 
you'll know that it does a does a fairly
decent<00:05:54.240> job<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.720> filtering<00:05:55.380> out<00:05:55.710> noise<00:05:56.270> and

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
decent job of filtering out noise and

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.870 
decent job of filtering out noise and
instead<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:58.020> doing<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.500> power<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.130> power

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
instead of you doing the power the power

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.969 
instead of you doing the power the power
pellet<00:06:00.419> filter<00:06:01.199> on<00:06:01.320> its<00:06:01.440> own<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:01.770> if<00:06:01.860> you're

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
pellet filter on its own but if you're

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.240 
pellet filter on its own but if you're
using<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.280> nine<00:06:02.430> volt<00:06:02.930> DC<00:06:03.930> adapter<00:06:04.860> you'll<00:06:05.039> have

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
using a nine volt DC adapter you'll have

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.210 
using a nine volt DC adapter you'll have
to<00:06:05.460> do<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.970> power<00:06:06.599> pallet<00:06:06.930> filter<00:06:07.320> because

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
to do the power pallet filter because

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.189 
to do the power pallet filter because
you<00:06:08.340> need<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:08.970> can't<00:06:09.210> put<00:06:09.479> nine<00:06:09.690> volts<00:06:10.050> into

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
you need you can't put nine volts into

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.230 
you need you can't put nine volts into
this<00:06:10.409> regulator<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.310> have<00:06:11.550> nine<00:06:11.760> volts<00:06:12.120> come

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
this regulator and have nine volts come

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.490 
this regulator and have nine volts come
out<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.450> other<00:06:12.510> end<00:06:12.599> it<00:06:12.779> would<00:06:12.840> be<00:06:12.960> like<00:06:13.110> seven

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
out the other end it would be like seven

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.529 
out the other end it would be like seven
volts<00:06:13.800> or<00:06:13.950> six<00:06:14.159> volts<00:06:14.520> there's<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.180> couple<00:06:15.360> of

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
volts or six volts there's a couple of

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.999 
volts or six volts there's a couple of
volts<00:06:15.840> that<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.110> needs<00:06:16.349> to

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
volts that it needs to

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.929 
volts that it needs to
to<00:06:17.759> to<00:06:18.150> do<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.449> to<00:06:18.719> do<00:06:18.869> its<00:06:19.020> thing<00:06:19.789> thanks<00:06:20.789> for
