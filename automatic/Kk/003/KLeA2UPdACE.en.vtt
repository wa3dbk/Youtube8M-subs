00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
isn't too much to discuss it was pretty

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
isn't too much to discuss it was pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> mean<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.290> was

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
straightforward all in all I mean it was

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
straightforward all in all I mean it was
cool<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> see<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> Zorro<00:01:38.220> led<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> charge<00:01:38.729> in

stopping<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> birdcage<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
stopping the birdcage even for just a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
stopping the birdcage even for just a
second<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.640> great<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
second that was all great and good and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
second that was all great and good and
all<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> stuff<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> actually

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
all that kind of stuff and is actually

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.649 
all that kind of stuff and is actually
interesting<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.000> chapter<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
interesting because in this chapter I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
interesting because in this chapter I
don't<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> caught<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.700> me

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
certain extent you know more of a setup

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.450 
certain extent you know more of a setup
in<00:02:52.050> terms<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.920> know<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.250> getting

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
in terms of like you know that getting

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
but just the way that it was structured

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
but just the way that it was structured
it<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.330> didn't<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:58.020> any<00:02:58.320> impact<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.070> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
don't know I just wasn't feeling the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.810 
don't know I just wasn't feeling the
whole<00:03:01.080> situation<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> mean<00:03:02.610> you're<00:03:02.730> gonna

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
get one of these chapters every once in

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.870 
get one of these chapters every once in
a<00:03:04.320> while<00:03:04.470> Oh<00:03:04.620> does<00:03:04.800> not<00:03:04.830> omnipotent<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.760> know

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
a while Oh does not omnipotent you know

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.130 
a while Oh does not omnipotent you know
he<00:03:06.030> makes<00:03:06.180> mistakes<00:03:06.600> every<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.080> again

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
he makes mistakes every now and again

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.110 
he makes mistakes every now and again
and<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.650> uh<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:08.100> felt<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.760> chapter

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and I just uh I felt like this chapter

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.850 
and I just uh I felt like this chapter
was<00:03:09.270> kind<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.750> throwaway<00:03:10.350> chapter<00:03:10.800> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
was kind of a throwaway chapter it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.710 
was kind of a throwaway chapter it
really<00:03:10.890> wasn't<00:03:11.400> anything<00:03:11.670> significant<00:03:12.600> in

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
really wasn't anything significant in

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.660 
really wasn't anything significant in
this<00:03:12.870> chapter<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.740> only<00:03:14.010> positive<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.490> take

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
this chapter the only positive I take

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.730 
this chapter the only positive I take
from<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> really<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> only<00:03:16.530> positive

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
from this really not the only positive

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.200 
from this really not the only positive
but<00:03:17.070> one<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> positives<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.820> take<00:03:18.030> from

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
but one of the positives I take from

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.330 
but one of the positives I take from
this<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> next<00:03:18.960> chapter<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:20.100> probably

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

going<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> conclusion<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.450> this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
going to get the conclusion to this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.840 
going to get the conclusion to this
