00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.599
 Now in the first year registered in the country in 1997 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.310
 It is nja zx 9 r 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 Is of the cab stay Further, the glass who have know is 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.150
 It is also fork to 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:24.050
 It has become over here 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.490
 Because it is ordered also in if there is a thing such as the sum, I mentioned once that Uchotto mountain range new 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.360
 The lens of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.200
 It is around a little this 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.000
 I have a little guarantee with a touch pen, but there are some scratches on this side 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.110
 I am 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.700
 I think that you can accept this area, but I'm saying in cutting here too 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.870
 So big 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.870
 I think it is the first 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.870
 They are 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.740
 It's a full exhaust of racing. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.760
 Even though it might not fit Ballmer all 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.760
 It is decided to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.590
 What 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.850
 As we are waiting for the intuitive titanium silencer as planned 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:16.950
 I think that I will look forward to a great sound after the next kindergarten 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 You are the army owner of maa, it has been kept for a long time from about 1000 km 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.840
 It's almost like a new school building , so it's a bit of a curse and it feels like it's up to now. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.840
 The debt is out now 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.970
 All meters 18,000 kg mounting height 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.630
 It's milk, it's a reverse import car, so here's that b-type final 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.250
 By that 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.210
 I think that because for those who can see is another dying era can be seen 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.550
 Here 's the setting for those who have a dynojet cab 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.659
 Ya we'll mended here 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.290
 Well site 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.430
 Match that exhaust point 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.070
 Has become the setting of the calling minutes to your positive like in the likely each person there is a knack to 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.760
 Even though guidance we give a little doing 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.790
 Because it is getting better and warm in summer 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.069
 There is no need to struggle so much 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.129
 I think I will be able to run 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.590
 The condition of the locker is not bad either 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.510
 Do you think? 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.980
 I think that says 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.780
 This is a bit hard to see, but it's also the king of the Red Ban Maintenance Fame Home 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.510
 Because we remain 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.810
 At that time too I think I will be Hanshin 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.430
 But it is in here. 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.730
 It's out of battery when Yoshimura comes in and it's out of charge and Tanaka doesn't follow now 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.080
 But for now that it will be usable at this site 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.710
 I will 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.340
 I will wait for 300 kilometers 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.340
 I'll let you work at night, but it's really fast 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:57.560
 If you don't know anything, if you get a large license, you may try riding for the time being. 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.450
 We have enough power to say that it will be really futon 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.410
 You have left that normal visiting part for a while 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.910
 It is here Well both customers as well but I think that there is a need to re-set 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.600
 To return to the original 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.240

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.240

 Since the comedy engine was also used, the basics of Korea 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.340
