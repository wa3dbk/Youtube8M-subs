00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.660
 race swimmers par excellence 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 famous Newfoundland are amazing and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 you can size the size that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 they have new paralysis and win with people 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 I am wanting to know if anything is not hard to see 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.899
 the size you have today in and what great 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.879
 what irony I am made to be the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.739
 dogs of such large size and that are 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.060
 the excellent swimmers and rescuers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.730
 not if it is so that this one 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.910
 from very ancient times exactly 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.130
 talking about the age of the Vikings ok 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.660
 in fact this dog but that's how they came to 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.530
 america precisely by the strait of 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.310
 bering 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.320
 there are two theories one there is a dog inside 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 of mythology that was called smoke 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 black dogs or this property of a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 viking of the name light ericsson and what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.590
 I cross with dogs that came here to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.899
 Americans who are also 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.290
 knew as dogs bears and from there it came out 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.880
 the race 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.840
 hundreds of thousands of years 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.970
 very famous precisely for being 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.540
 Rescuer is the rescue dog in 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.490
 most incredible water that can exist 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.900
 affectionate tolerant very friendly 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.900
 can coexist with other races 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.350
 and they are very noble they are very tolerant in 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.710
 the whole word 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 what is tolerant are enough of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.039
 done nowadays are already more used before 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.100
 play so sporadically by 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.100
 sports and not but nowadays it is more 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.950
 already used for what is not from now 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.410
 so this today let's say there are the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 blocks the ransoms on this in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.120
 helicopter and helicopter and from there 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.980
 They are thrown into the sea to be able to rescue 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.709
 to the people that form the rescue 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.989
 this look there are two types now yes that a 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.610
 if it has the attachment is a 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.670
 guy like vest that have some 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.799
 nice you grab hold or the other 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 for the same thing because of the hair as it is this is 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:38.450
 long is subject to the person or the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.720
 person is in case the person 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.970
 already let's say I do not know already pretty with your 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.319
 unconscious what if they take the arm 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 and this one and it's pulling company and it has 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.530
 enough strength for your 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.510
 place is the dog is still swimming in the clear 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.120
 they have a very special characteristic 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.400
 they are web-footed as the ducks have 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.400
 membranes we can teach it because it is 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.400
 amazing 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:17.060
 even the membrane are sourced from 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.910
 canada say the mass originates is 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.980
 originates and already there because it sticks 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 to the world not here we are talking about that in 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.830
 every part of the world there is a standard of 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.830
 the federation 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.959
 of Canada and the USA which is the one 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.200
 It makes clear in the colors the 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.360
 black white with black and brown not 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.760
 I was commenting gray that gray 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.920
 it's also in mexico I think there's no 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.650
 in that key two there is a fast for 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.239
 there they have this gray but let's not say 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.160
 as the race not very well-known mind 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.590
 get to deliver added fight and 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.610
 josefa 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.500
 and then with the playful for spaces 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.840
 small in departments can 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.830
 work well also the newfoundland is 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:16.389
 applicant but of love in a space of 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:20.160
 a boxer to where we say statue 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.160
 the median of eating a dog like this 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.950
 imagine what wonder not put not 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.680
 has buy is patent department 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 does not offer half of the room said of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.010
 there are some joys that we have 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.350
 the contract we have always raised 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.520
 Newfoundland we've been around 14 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.520
 years in this 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.040
 how this puppy I put 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:05:01.730
 the puppy is never marking 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:04.030
 territory wants your places are like 28 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.030
 liters 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:17.600
 and I told you an anecdote about my daughter 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.910
 when I was little 60 we had 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.320
 the dogs have their little house then the 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.210
 that we had before so the first 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.790
 land that we had were pretty much 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.820
 the size of the east the dog was asleep 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.130
 in his house and my daughter grabbed and went to 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.210
 sleep with the dog then at 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.050
 you do not know where we're going 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.300
 looking around the house until the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.540
 their dog was already asleep with the 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.910
 bayern 9 kings of unsettled not clear today 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.500
 It is important to mention that they are useful 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.380
 depending on when there are children 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.330
 guys handle their size carefully 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.129
 they measure they know their proportion 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.289
 of the damage that can be done 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.669
 the bites ignored by a push is 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.649
 very interesting that when there is a 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.919
 situation beyond some danger they 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.989
 analyze the situation first 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:06.919
 true reaction so it is if they are to 

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:08.779
 despite not being very gentle they are also 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.139
 very protective can not distinguish 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:19.219
 when it's something let's say I do not know of danger 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:21.439
 that they can try to see a 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.659
 ya barking because with that this one 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:26.229
 and kept at bay and with that I think 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:28.699
 Matthew is about to pass away, no longer 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.830
 reflects with puppies does not behave 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.080
 know what you said you have your can 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.389
 living with any pet are 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.419
 very tolerant dogs are very dogs 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.939
 analytical even though they are greedy and 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.029
 the fame of intelligence goes more towards 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.679
 the shepherd dogs to the bad guys these 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.209
 dogs are very smart very 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:48.949
 precarious very analytical I 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:50.329
 I commented that I send a greeting to 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.159

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.720
 It was a great dog that obviously 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.000
 the years already died but good the 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.100

 with this hair is what I can tell you and 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.660
 I think today Matthew is going to sleep but 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.190
 I kill but to see where is a little 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.600
