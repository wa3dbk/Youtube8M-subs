going to be it not yet really rolling to
a<00:03:28.190> game<00:03:28.459> up<00:03:28.900> well<00:03:29.900> very<00:03:30.380> well<00:03:30.680> played<00:03:31.010> i<00:03:31.160> mean

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
a game up well very well played i mean

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.030 
a game up well very well played i mean
they<00:03:31.670> executed<00:03:32.270> their<00:03:32.420> composition<00:03:33.140> as<00:03:33.620> it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
they executed their composition as it

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.890 
they executed their composition as it
should<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.400> been<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:35.000> little<00:03:35.420> bit<00:03:35.630> more

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
should have been a little bit more

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.540 
should have been a little bit more
surprising<00:03:36.560> might<00:03:36.709> just<00:03:36.950> be<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.130> fact<00:03:37.459> that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
surprising might just be the fact that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.400 
surprising might just be the fact that
the<00:03:37.760> koo<00:03:37.940> tigers<00:03:38.180> seemed<00:03:38.600> really<00:03:38.870> shaken<00:03:39.320> up

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
the koo tigers seemed really shaken up

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.530 
the koo tigers seemed really shaken up
in<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.650> first<00:03:39.920> game<00:03:40.040> yeah<00:03:40.790> they<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.450> think

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
in that first game yeah they I think

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.240 
in that first game yeah they I think
they<00:03:41.810> had<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.989> good<00:03:42.170> draft<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.680> deal<00:03:42.890> with<00:03:43.100> this

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
they had a good draft to deal with this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.100 
they had a good draft to deal with this
too<00:03:43.520> they<00:03:43.760> handed<00:03:44.030> answer<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.570> veins<00:03:44.780> flip

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
too they handed answer to the veins flip

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.590 
too they handed answer to the veins flip
Bush<00:03:45.290> they<00:03:45.560> did<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:46.459> interesting<00:03:47.090> things<00:03:47.330> at

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
Bush they did some interesting things at

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.510 
Bush they did some interesting things at
the<00:03:47.690> picket<00:03:47.989> ban<00:03:48.230> phase<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.800> make<00:03:49.010> sure<00:03:49.220> that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
the picket ban phase to make sure that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.760 
the picket ban phase to make sure that
they<00:03:49.640> could<00:03:49.880> deal<00:03:50.600> with<00:03:50.959> what<00:03:51.140> najin<00:03:51.590> was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
they could deal with what najin was

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.220 
they could deal with what najin was
throwing<00:03:52.190> at<00:03:52.340> them<00:03:52.580> but<00:03:52.820> it's<00:03:53.360> just<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.900> was<00:03:54.050> a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
throwing at them but it's just it was a

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.229 
throwing at them but it's just it was a
lot<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.530> mechanical<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.370> positional<00:03:55.970> miss

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
plays from the Tigers that got them

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.580 
plays from the Tigers that got them
really<00:03:58.430> far<00:03:58.700> behind<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:59.270> terms<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.600> gold<00:03:59.900> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
really far behind in terms of gold and
