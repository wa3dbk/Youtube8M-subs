00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 the internaut to Brazil is eliminated from the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.889
 world cup will now play the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 third place 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.460
 a shame and a 7 to 1 from germany 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
 Let's go live with pictures there in the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.410
 the stadium of the mining company 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 who is leaving the stadium in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.840
 good part of that crowd has left 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.700
 before ending even the first time already 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.700
 was 5 to 0 for Germany 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 Messi is a mood of sadness and disappointment 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.829
 said yesterday that it will comment on this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.829
 match 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 All right, Felipe, I'd say I'd say 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 I would not say that it was the biggest shame of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.250
 brazil in all the history of your soccer 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.379
 the two biggest goals had been Brazil 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 suffered is a 6 to 0 by Uruguay 1920 and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 16 years old we had a rocca cup 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.500
 I think almost 40 in 40 conical debuted 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 jair pink pinto but not to mention never 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.659
 took seven goals to talk about the past 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 Brazil, I'll tell you again, it was a 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.659
 so great massacre such a shame 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 the biggest in football history 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.110
 in terms of selection and without 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.450
 doubt the greatest vexation in world cups 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.360
 that was me, I'll repeat how you arrived 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:44.820
 The way you are going to play Brazil lies in the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 germany or 1234567 brazil 11 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 I repeat with emphasis on the following I have 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.229
 impression that this defeat this appointment 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.670
 this vexation 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:04.079
 this disaster this is all going to be a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.500
 divisor of waters in Brazilian soccer 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.319
 so as to the game the first seemed 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 one more workout is for a professional team 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.830
 against a youth team germany 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.459
 not Brazil with the ease with which 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 that the German attackers involved the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.959
 Brazilian defenders 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.760
 or if you prefer a game of 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.170
 married to the married were the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.299
 Fat Brazilians and single beds 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:43.319
 german airways there all fast agile lep 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.819
 of the scorers and saw a joke 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.390
 I thought it was a joke. 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.760
 from 5.10 ends Brazil has given luck trapped 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.760
 under set and made a nest at the end
