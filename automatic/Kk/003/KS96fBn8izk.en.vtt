as<00:00:30.119> well<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:31.199> not<00:00:31.410> too<00:00:31.679> sure<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.020> basically

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
as well I'm not too sure and basically

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.729 
as well I'm not too sure and basically
what<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.340> ideal<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.510> give<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
what the ideal is they give you more of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.580 
what the ideal is they give you more of
an<00:00:38.250> angle<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.969> turn<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.540> analog<00:00:39.870> sticks<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
an angle to turn your analog sticks so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
an angle to turn your analog sticks so
that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.010> play<00:00:41.280> better<00:00:41.820> cod<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.110> box

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that you can play better cod on the box

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.229 
that you can play better cod on the box
they<00:00:43.559> say<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.550> kills<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.270> less<00:00:45.480> deaths<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
they say more kills and less deaths and

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.110 
they say more kills and less deaths and

what I see so far and this is acts like

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.110 
what I see so far and this is acts like
a<00:00:53.820> lot<00:00:54.120> first<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:56.730> sure<00:00:56.760> about

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a lot first I was really not sure about

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
a lot first I was really not sure about
it<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.579> after<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> few<00:00:59.670> games<00:00:59.969> convince

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it but then after a few games convince

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.250 
it but then after a few games convince
me<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.289> definitely<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.600> good<00:01:03.600> purchase

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
me it was definitely a good purchase

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
me it was definitely a good purchase
actually<00:01:05.250> didn't<00:01:05.430> purchase<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.299> them

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
actually didn't purchase them I got them

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually didn't purchase them I got them
for<00:01:06.750> free<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> gamestop<00:01:07.860> calm<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

go to work the first game I didn't do so
well<00:01:22.870> took<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.620> lot<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.800> weight<00:01:23.950> long<00:01:24.610> time<00:01:24.820> that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
well took a lot of weight long time that

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.780 
well took a lot of weight long time that
used<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.360> but<00:01:25.540> then<00:01:25.800> after<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> few<00:01:26.890> games<00:01:27.310> I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
used to it but then after a few games I

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.900 
used to it but then after a few games I
was<00:01:28.330> getting<00:01:28.750> constant<00:01:29.590> games<00:01:30.190> where<00:01:30.430> my<00:01:30.550> k/d

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
was getting constant games where my k/d

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.310 
was getting constant games where my k/d
ratio<00:01:31.060> was<00:01:31.630> five<00:01:32.940> at<00:01:33.940> least<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:35.110> was

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
ratio was five at least and it was

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.920 
ratio was five at least and it was
working<00:01:35.500> out<00:01:35.860> really<00:01:36.040> well<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:37.570> actually

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
working out really well and I actually

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.540 
working out really well and I actually
also<00:01:38.590> liked<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.970> texture<00:01:43.600> on<00:01:43.810> top<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.170> the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
also liked the the texture on top of the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.390 
also liked the the texture on top of the
analog<00:01:45.550> sticks<00:01:45.880> they<00:01:46.180> feel<00:01:46.930> very<00:01:47.400> good

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
analog sticks they feel very good

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.130 
analog sticks they feel very good
quality<00:01:48.640> actually<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.509> mean<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:49.990> little

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
quality actually I mean that little

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.170 
quality actually I mean that little
pieces<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.500> plastic<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.280> they're<00:01:52.000> good

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
pieces of plastic but they're good

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.760 
pieces of plastic but they're good
quality<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.780> I'm<00:01:53.290> pretty<00:01:53.440> sure<00:01:53.530> they're<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
quality and I'm pretty sure they're a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.950 
quality and I'm pretty sure they're a
good<00:01:53.920> price<00:01:54.160> not<00:01:54.759> totally<00:01:55.150> sure<00:01:55.360> how<00:01:55.570> much

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
good price not totally sure how much

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
they cost but I mean they can't cost my

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
ten dollars and it actually really

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.139

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.820 
to say is that you need if you plan a
really<00:02:18.910> low<00:02:19.209> sensitivity<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.530> might<00:02:20.709> not

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
really low sensitivity you might not

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.320 
really low sensitivity you might not
necessarily<00:02:21.070> like<00:02:21.790> these<00:02:22.630> because<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:25.150> just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
necessarily like these because you just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.600 
necessarily like these because you just
they<00:02:25.780> don't<00:02:25.810> feel<00:02:26.440> right<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.980> they<00:02:27.340> really

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
they don't feel right and they really

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.660 
they don't feel right and they really
they<00:02:28.269> really<00:02:28.299> play<00:02:28.780> better<00:02:29.019> when<00:02:29.260> your

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
they really play better when your

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
they really play better when your
sensitivities<00:02:30.670> at<00:02:30.790> least<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> four<00:02:31.380> that's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
sensitivities at least the four that's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.289 
sensitivities at least the four that's
what<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> put<00:02:32.920> mine<00:02:33.100> as<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.370> mine<00:02:33.820> was<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.060> three

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
what I put mine as I mine was a three

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.670 
what I put mine as I mine was a three
and<00:02:34.420> then<00:02:34.540> when<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.780> got<00:02:34.870> these<00:02:35.140> i<00:02:35.200> put<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.650> to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and then when I got these i put it up to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.830 
and then when I got these i put it up to
a<00:02:35.830> four<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.760> actually<00:02:36.910> really<00:02:37.420> worked<00:02:37.690> out

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
a four and it actually really worked out

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.910
