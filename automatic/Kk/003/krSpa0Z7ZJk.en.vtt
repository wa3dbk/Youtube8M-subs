 In the spine has a fin that ends in sharp, extremely sharp, which we will have to remove 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:17.000
 In the area of ​​the gill, when lifting it has a small triangle in which you can see the edge of a "knife" 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 We make a cut parallel to the spine, using the tip of the knife to guide us. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 We pass the finger and check where the spine of the gut is that we should remove.

 We hope it has helped you. Thank you very much http://ungatoentrefogones.webnode.es/
