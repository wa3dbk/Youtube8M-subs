a<00:02:19.170> good<00:02:20.170> trick<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.800> create<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> really<00:02:21.730> dark

a good trick to create a really dark
black<00:02:22.720> smokey<00:02:23.230> eye<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.740> use<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> black<00:02:24.430> liner

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
black smokey eye is to use a black liner

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
black smokey eye is to use a black liner
pencil<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> base<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> 1<00:02:27.010> i'm<00:02:27.100> using<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.460> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
pencil as a base so the 1 i'm using is a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.940 
pencil as a base so the 1 i'm using is a
jumble<00:02:27.940> pencil<00:02:28.330> from<00:02:28.540> next<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
jumble pencil from next and this is the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.740 
jumble pencil from next and this is the
shape<00:02:30.160> black<00:02:30.400> bean<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.850> i'm<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
shape black bean and i'm just going to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.540 
shape black bean and i'm just going to
roughly<00:02:32.080> apply<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.680> over<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.040> lid<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
roughly apply that all over the lid and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.520 
roughly apply that all over the lid and
then<00:02:33.610> i'm<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.150> blend<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.690> out<00:02:34.840> now<00:02:35.410> what

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
then i'm going to blend it out now what

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.560 
then i'm going to blend it out now what
this<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.770> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.250> create<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.850> sort<00:02:37.480> of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
this is going to do is create a sort of

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.410 
this is going to do is create a sort of
sticky<00:02:38.470> base<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.220> could<00:02:39.370> say<00:02:39.550> for<00:02:39.580> our<00:02:40.180> black

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
sticky base you could say for our black

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.240 
sticky base you could say for our black
eyeshadow<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.260> also<00:02:41.440> going<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.830> ensure

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
eyeshadow and it's also going to ensure

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.800 
eyeshadow and it's also going to ensure
that<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.580> black<00:02:42.820> eyeshadow<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.390> really

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
that the black eyeshadow is really

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.930 
that the black eyeshadow is really
really<00:02:44.020> dark<00:02:44.320> because<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.250> don't<00:02:45.400> know<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.790> you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
really dark because I don't know if you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.790 
really dark because I don't know if you
like<00:02:46.090> me<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.570> also<00:02:46.810> always<00:02:47.050> find<00:02:47.560> that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
like me but I also always find that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.830 
like me but I also always find that
black<00:02:47.980> eye<00:02:48.190> shadows<00:02:48.550> just<00:02:48.580> never<00:02:49.030> asked<00:02:49.510> super

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
black eye shadows just never asked super

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.960 
black eye shadows just never asked super
super<00:02:49.960> blegh<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.100> order<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.370> get<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.640> really

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
super blegh so in order to get it really

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.440 
super blegh so in order to get it really
dark<00:02:52.210> it's<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.720> good<00:02:52.900> idea<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.290> apply<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:54.490> cream

instead of swiping is because it's

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.580
