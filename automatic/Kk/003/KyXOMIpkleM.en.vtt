when the trip comes to an end chances

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.379 
when the trip comes to an end chances
are<00:05:10.979> good<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.250> you'll<00:05:11.550> just<00:05:11.790> want<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.120> start

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
the whole thing over again but it's hard

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.060 
the whole thing over again but it's hard
to<00:05:14.880> say<00:05:15.060> why<00:05:15.290> because<00:05:16.290> there'll<00:05:16.530> be<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:16.919> many

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
to say why because there'll be so many

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.640 
to say why because there'll be so many
memories<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.729> your<00:05:18.030> head<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.479> so<00:05:18.810> much<00:05:18.990> joy<00:05:19.410> in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.309 

I<00:05:23.520> guess<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.360> has<00:05:24.479> something<00:05:24.509> to<00:05:24.900> do<00:05:25.020> with<00:05:25.169> that

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
I guess it has something to do with that

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.529 
I guess it has something to do with that
special<00:05:25.770> feeling<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.400> get<00:05:26.580> from<00:05:26.819> travelling
