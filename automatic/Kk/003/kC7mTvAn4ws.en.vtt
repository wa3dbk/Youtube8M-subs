00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 hello girls and boys so here 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.670
 a new video where I'm going to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.310
 represent the late pop style I'm going 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.529
 you put the steampunk link so the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.770
 flat iron steam in the real 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 heroes and just right here so for that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.420
 you can see I think it was 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.220
 a year ago or a year and a half no i know 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.110
 more too and so the steampunk was 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.059
 released and so there is a special edition 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.160
 which came out recently is the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.809
 stigma safari chic and so that's the one 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.610
 this is the machine 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.739
 so that's the steam iron finally the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.870
 hair straightener to my fear so there are the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.210
 little brushes here I do not know if you 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 can see this so small that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.930
 allows you to brush before you move 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 your straightener so thing that I 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.769
 did with my straightener chi but 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.120
 I always spent a fine brush in 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.920
 and I passed the straightener 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.049
 directly right after that so that's the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.049
 do and then that's machines that 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.690
 contains water and so here you will see 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.570
 how I finally use the device 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.219
 so here are some great suckers 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.039
 owl I showed you immediately 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.119
 like to eat so it's very 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.380
 simple it's like business ali it's 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.539
 normal just 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.479
 be careful there are arrows and 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.359
 so we have to follow down and 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.450
 so do not do like these since the 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.310
 Steam can stagnate at one place and 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.439
 form drops of water that will be very 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.450
 hot fell on you so that's 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.329
 very very hot it's a device that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.689
 is that I do not advise touching here 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.670
 to apply pressure in addition to it 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.869
 really have to let the machine and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.460
 especially not put your fingers because 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.960
 it's very hot so that's what it is 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.610
 that I have to tell you is going nothing else to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.830
 part look 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.130
 so here to begin with I'm you 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.960
 advise the demineralized 79 500 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.970
 stores for 5 liters so you know 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.090
 it's really cheap here it's 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.730
 the device so here the container where you 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.040
 put the water and you have small 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.450
 cupping that allows you to stabilize 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.550
 the device in order not to make it fall 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.530
 and be careful not to put it or 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.200
 horizontally on the carnage end on 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.180
 tiling 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.010
 otherwise it could make the water run 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.140
 so flat and you have the little signal 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.240
 max have not exceeded the small signal 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.709
 you receive in the box a test that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 allows you to test your water from 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.560
 tap to see if she can go 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.150
 in the device but me I you 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.180
 really advise the other demineralized 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.450
 and to read the booklet finally the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.230
 user manual before the device goes up 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.000
 at 210 Â° and minimum 170 degrees and so 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.860
 it's very easy to pass you 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 the device 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.920
 finally if you have someone who has 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.739
 preferably brushed knots well received 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.560
 before it must absolutely be dry 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.090
 not wet but really right after the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.150
 exit becomes well dried finally you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.670
 put the product believes todd 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.170
 before and then you pass 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.180
 the hair dryer to dry the hair 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.010
 and then you pass the stim not so 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 especially not to use with hair 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.380
 wet and so that's it's very simple 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.880
 like a normal straightener it takes 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.849
 maybe stay a little longer 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.920
 on the wick so I go twice 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.680
 as I have thick and frizzy hair 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.300
 but I'm conquered from this 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.550
 device since it really lets me 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.319
 soft hair and appears in dry like 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 for 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.569
 a normal straightener so I think the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.049
 steam really has a role in it and 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.049
 serum 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.270
 the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.270
 2 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.270
 1 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 e 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.360
 and 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.820
 1 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.990
 Oh 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.669
 no change concerning the machine 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.680
 the machine is the right bmc 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.330
 the aesthetics of this one the package 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.440
 here I am big big kisses and I 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 tell you next time for a 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.729
 next video is here
