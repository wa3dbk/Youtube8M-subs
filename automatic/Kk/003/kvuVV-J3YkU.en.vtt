00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 Hello dear friends, finally 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 there was such a victory about which you can 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.560
 say she is absolutely deserved 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.570
 she is under no other 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 under no circumstances could it be 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.740
 other result except our 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 today's victory locomotive played better 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.629
 than chop the locomotive scored he scored two 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.680
 ball ss play one penalty this is a rout 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:40.440
 stage 1 defeat this season in general 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.900
 everything is great everything is perfect and in the end 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.190
 Dima came rams made this match 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.350
 better match of the season for me personally 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.559
 I want to run and scream I told you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 same said removed bozhovicha removed from 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.110
 composition of Yanbaev and Tarasov for some 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.629
 reasons I do not know for what but in the past 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 match these were the two most 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.000
 unmotivated locomotive fight 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 Today Denisov went to the center of the field 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 Shishkina played in general, it is very 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 not bad but most importantly all the players locomotives 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.759
 have played 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.099
 it is with motivation that they are not easy 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.929
 out on the field somehow live to see the end 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:22.140
 May to go on vacation 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:25.229
 they got out fought for them for every 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 the ball was torn out and rolled up 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.729
 this eventually gave what was missing 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.920
 locomotive in fractions of a second in micro 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 episodes when it was decided to share 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 seconds here the motive turned out to be a little 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.550
 faster slightly better moment there from the penalty spot 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.280
 for example yes to the third goal down and just 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.190
 for a split second ahead put his foot and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.160
 in the end, a quirkquelia crashed into it 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.560
 the last match of this was not in 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.869
 fractions of a second in these micro episodes our 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.979
 players lost and for this happened 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.229
 defeat and draw that we had 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.470
 even the most significant moment is there 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.289
 where is the relevance of 5 minute fernandish 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.390
 ran for her player in the penalty area and in 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.489
 subcategory knocked his ball on it such 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.170
 for five years there were no spheres nanda show not 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.790
 beshiktash not valencia he for his 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.430
 player penal communication did not run and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.470
 he didn't want to give a shit about it all 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 I know whether Cherchenko managed to get through 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 before the players either simply not 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.530
 already realized that well, if they are fused 2 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.400
 Coach for the season, then something like that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.470
 you can try to strain but precisely in 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.450
 this game locomotive today delivered 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.120
 pleasure and in principle but what 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.920
 blame won 30 won 30 and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.870
 seriously enough the opponent does not need 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 belittle the ruby they certainly were going 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.050
 today is not my best game but the team 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.959
 strong and they could well score their 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.010
 one second ball but locomotive showed 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.950
 rigidity drive showed protection skill 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.959
 played well and did not give won these 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.959
 lining areas in which a ruby could score 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.370
 principle, probably as I told you can 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
 call this game absolutely the best in 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.599
 season because not with a bunch of shade 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.760
 the truth is not the device live che such 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.280
 domination locomotive this season is not 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.000
 it was very sorry ruby 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.060
 but they were not lucky they got to the locomotive 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.520
 after the resignation of Bozovic what you need 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
 was done two weeks ago a month 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.040
 back and better not to nominate at all 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.709
 Bozovic and would play now the turtle 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.470
 it happened to ruby now probably 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.580
 they are no longer European cups not with 4 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.500
 a place so much where we 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.450
 disqualifies maybe then there is 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.489
 chance but well, sometimes there is no luck this match 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.280
 still very pleasant context of the fact that 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.550
 Cup we have a week to less well 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.680
 than a week on thursday next with 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.430
 such a game with such a mood with such 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.800
 of motivation 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.510
 locomotive has every chance because 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.260
 Cuba today once again lost 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.239
 and Kuban on the contrary goes downward they 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.100
 not fired kuchuk then when he filed 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.110
 retired and when they had a chance on 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.690
 absolutely the same pick as we have 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.590
 leave a bunch to a little emotional 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.090
 explosion and Kuban would be maybe 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.160
 would explode would rush ahead from them 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.739
 This will not have them play Kuchuk this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.370
 there will be monotony again and as I said 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.830
 in the past when about bozhevich apparatuses 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.290
 stroked impossible month 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.900
 play low morale and lose 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.680
 championship and then take and win the cup 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.530
 rush forward frantically and crush 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.950
 there is no such rival locomotive 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.900
 having played a lead on this 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.930
 Bozovic destination resign Th Repchenko 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.789
 match with a ruby ​​who gave confidence 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.490
 to the players of their strength that they can they 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.160
 know how to do it 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.200
 play football and win it serious 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.830
 help for us on thursday next in 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.669
 Astrakhan 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.160
 and it is very cool hope locomotive 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.440
 show at least the game is not worse than it was 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.810
 it is today 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.700
 Well, the last moment which is very 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.580
 I want to note this is certainly the way Dima 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.490
 barinov 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.500
 but it's just great bozhevich for half a year 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 never found the time to release 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.720
 at least someone at least one and him 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.550
 wound field through them did it in the first 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.430
 same match after his resignation and 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.400
 there was nothing terrible about it and how I 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.680
 I understand the attack on the third goal started exactly 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.330
 Dima his selection and pasan but 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.940
 it turns out the players from the age of 17 cannot 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.550
 spoil the match that is so good 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.780
 one gets why not trust them i don't 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:51.349
 I understand good luck dime and I hope that this 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.000
 not the last exit and that soon he 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.070
 will start to go out even mostly 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.620
 the composition especially as with reference 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:04.159
 defenders have trouble we shishkin out 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.659
 although this is not his position if che repchenko 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.840
 sees the bar but i really 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.919
 the prospect of playing so he 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.039
 became a good player 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.930
 I hope that in the next rounds dime 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.550
 will fall out more time and he will 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.310
 go there already not five minutes in 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.949
 the ending a 10 by 15 and not only in those 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:26.270
 matches that have already been won and there the score is 20 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:29.840
 30 a and for more serious tasks 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.210
 Dima is basically a good player and can 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:38.979
 this will probably handle all about it 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.979
 match with you was a type bye
