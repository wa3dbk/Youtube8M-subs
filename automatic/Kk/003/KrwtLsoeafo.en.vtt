which they love and I love making we're
going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> start<00:00:14.070> with<00:00:14.519> three<00:00:15.360> eggs<00:00:15.570> which<00:00:16.440> I'm

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
going to start with three eggs which I'm

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to start with three eggs which I'm
going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.100> separate<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.060> need<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
going to separate because we need to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.490 
going to separate because we need to
whisk<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> egg<00:00:18.720> right<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:21.080> tip<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.109> in

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
whisk the egg right and tip that in

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.609 
whisk the egg right and tip that in
there<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
there like that

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
there like that
it's<00:00:25.619> important<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.640> clean<00:00:26.970> with

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it's important to have them clean with

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's important to have them clean with
no<00:00:27.420> oil<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.260> grease<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.650> us<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:28.980> anything<00:00:29.160> else

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
no oil or grease on us or anything else

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.069 
no oil or grease on us or anything else
they<00:00:29.609> won't<00:00:29.730> whisk<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.870> much

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
they won't whisk so that's pretty much

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
they won't whisk so that's pretty much
as<00:00:37.440> firm<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.129> you've<00:00:38.280> got<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.610> see
