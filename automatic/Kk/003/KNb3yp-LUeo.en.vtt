00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
 trend is I think you already 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430

 This makeup will rock you 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.500
 so let's go to the tutorial tips 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.979
 To start the makeup today I'm going to use 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.530
 danny webb 03 applying with the 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:54.510
 synthetic bristle brush on the eyelid 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.510
 and fixed eyelid 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 You will now pick up a brush 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.040
 cuddly and a brown shadow will start 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.290
 to dial the bill then and smoke doing 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 circular movements lead in the shade in 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 towards the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.800
 You do not have to stay perfect, it 's just for 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.300
 make that mark even we still 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.300
 Let's go back to work in the field. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.880
 now with the bigger brush but we 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.290
 Let's take a more orange and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 This is the brownest we've ever had. 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.440
 passed the story in the same way doing 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.979
 circular movements of anger on top 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.979
 of marking 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.710
 I'm already enjoying girls and volume. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.299
 in lace the eyebrow with the brush of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.299
 cuddly bristles 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.040
 to let your eye go deeper 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.930
 you can also use a more brown 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.750
 dark in the concave will make a gradient 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.849
 of cool colors and this is cool for 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.040
 Who has that paulo and fallen brasilia? 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:32.200
 but that already has the conca well marked not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.510
 You need to make this conversation on the eyelid. 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.510
 mobile apply a shadow on skin color 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.209
 even closer to skin color then 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.680
 if you do not have a beige shade a pole 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.829
 the color of your skin will also stay 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.829
 cool 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.599
 Now we're going to do a little bit of 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.599
 light in the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.000

 here in the outer corner of the eye to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.430

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.600

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.280
 We are going to take all this time well. 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.180
 close to the root of the eyelashes 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.220
 reciprocating movements to get a 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.140
