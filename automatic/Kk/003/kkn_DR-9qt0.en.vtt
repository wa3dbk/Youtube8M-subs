00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.269
 249 a friend spoke recently of great 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:14.410
 beard big mud here is a character 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.910
 what do I know I asked will be true because 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.759
 the topic came out childish and with what 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.800
 it happened with lorenzetti I wanted to have 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.810
 some more verification not to throw 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.419
 to what later one always has the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.059
 return of the apology if you have good faith 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:33.039
 in the acts of his life do not apologize 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:36.430
 the fools but study beard appears 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.110
 here apparently in this audio saying 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.719
 in the conversation with news what 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.570
 effectively said in this case the 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.270
 magazine you come from a better known hug 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.670
 that you do not leave them have compared them with the 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.070
 gothic album torture does not generate any 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 type of doubt in the constant link of the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.340
 world 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.810
 a Canarian base that he has dedicated 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 studies 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.010
 of the nation comparable to face this 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.610
 also sound for anyone to be with 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.120
 nobody takes advantage in augusta does not know said 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 I do not know if he is worried false hitler 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.490
 so we are all paying 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 I denied, I asked, I understand 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 how good if this vision what 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 show the big beard hits are you a guy 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 spectacular except that karman see me 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.070
 has to say the game for example 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.070
 want to change some sanction 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.520
 certain outbursts of those who have 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 So much influence anyway, but 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.980
 in beard room sack baratísima when you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.900
 He gave advice to politicians and 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.890
 media the means of 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.530
 communication the clarion nation to whom 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.720
 harass 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.180
 sometimes you have to strengthen yourself to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.280
 maintain health in the face of so much 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.540
 harassment because the advice of durán 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.140
 beard is that the enemy has to 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.390
 force him to get his total 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.640
 depression will be possible suicide will 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.660
 remember that the political council 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.280
 that he gave was telling the real anecdote to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.340
 those of a politician who 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 they painted in the neighborhood where it was known that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.040
 he walked some horrible things a 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.160
 boy could not live with this had 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.680
 to achieve even its destruction had to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
 annihilate two a rival of mentality 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 of embargo 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.690
 is written in books overlooked 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 this continued in the pro macri in that 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.100
 sense has a very good relationship look 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.950
 that what he said will be a beard to what 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.430
 he made the fine palaces and listened 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.600
 that all this goes to free nothing more 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.180
 that because you do not have protection 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.400
 journalism that others do not enjoy is very 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.860
 serious but journalistic protection 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.380
 love that is what allows you to maintain 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.130
 this error and not throw it out of the pro so 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.820
 less to durán var 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.790
 liberman as a Jew who has 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.370
 intellectual leader of the group saying that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.470
 if seeing is a spectacular physicist 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.460
 I would also have to give some kind of 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.090
 explanations 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.070
 hannah arendt an exceptional woman had 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.020
 problems because she said that some 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:25.720
 Jewish leaders had facilitated that 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.800
 a part of the killing of 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.620
 Jews 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.150
 worse things have been said 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.920
 to put it somehow the last 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.530
 days is a little more here than the last 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.750
 days but not to give too many fixed 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.390
 a horror what has been said nor amia 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.640
 nor size can react many 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.590
 times in front of this type of attack where 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.659
 there are the releases but they have a beard 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.390
 how much does it circulate you are not 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.670
 communicating from the amia where is the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.709
 communicates size status 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.040
 berman besides not ask durán 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.030
 beard is going is the keeper of a 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.920
 decision but that goes from the drawer but the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.200
 daia and the amia and whatever the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.959
 Jewish community that can protest 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.900
 against nobody is a type of relevance 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.109
 policy that the man who manages has 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.570
 the intellectuality of the pro of a party 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.639
 politician says what the put it again 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.740
 because it seems lie what this man 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.740
 says of the beginning with him or her 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.620
 no no 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.340
 I apologize to Daia and Amia but 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.670
 Daia thousand apologies and I get a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.170
 communicated daia repudiated the praises to 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.510
 hitler of the imbecile of jaime durán beard 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.670
 so they go empathetic to the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.670
 idea that since I had not received the 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.930
 news did not exist I look like an Iraqi clarion 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.700
 and here is what happens that is very 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.640
 recent to see what they will say about something is a 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.480
 imbecile swiped the place in addition to vices 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.009
 emigrants but a person prepared and 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.319
 lawyer as he walked 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.430
 I think it goes through invisibility 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:16.059
 and he says if he says he's still 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.639
 official that was the caldillo so it's 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.349
 very important is the world 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.939
 we think it deserves repudiation has 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.659
 used civil society have felt 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:27.520
 he described two things as shamefully good 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.909
 first 3 insisted on the apologies 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.759
 because it was a full attack 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.069
 unfounded second the radio audio of the 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.090
 treatable being from mónica and 6 and I take advantage 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.570
 to send you a greeting 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.570
 Y 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.449
 trained to be there is a third thing that 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.180
 they occurred to me and from the third to the 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.449
 radio then has repudiated the compliments 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.129
 Hitler of the imbecile in front of Jaime 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.530
 durán if I want to do it third is 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.300
 as it did not occur to us is to say here there 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.069
 a double error in addition to having resulted 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.199
 of the sizes that are made of 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.629
 we call each other to see 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.599
 if he had something to say about it 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.639
 well we closed this episode but 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:12.090
 let's hope it did not close it has been easy 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.779
 but is free whatever one 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.000
 can say that about a community that 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:21.120
 he suffered what he suffered that is so 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.340
 sensitive to these issues and that has 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.560
 had the corresponding behavior 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.870
 the representation of the carving sometimes 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.379
 we say amia I do not know if the spider 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.240
 corresponds 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:35.460
 there is 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.259
 let's make the cordial exit and say 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.960
 truth to the girl did not say anything what has 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.229
 what to say is the damage and good that has 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.229
 saying 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.539
 but if it was not a statement so far 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.680
 at least I thought if there is a statement 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.330
 now can a note made and I would like 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.220
 sound with the program of what the day 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.220
 he left us the silver radio 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.390
 Romina Calderaro a good look at the 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.010
 romina calderaro breakfast that was the 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.360
 restlessness immediately these early 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:14.210
 in the morning to make a note that with 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.460
 all frankness is a condition is more 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.520
 early in the morning it is at night 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.260
 Friday from 21 to 23 something did one day I 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.080
 has joined percent the soil have gone up 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.020
 to the networks now surely at 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.910
 collect grades of where does it come from 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.920
 good of Rominal forgiveness is because the 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.620
 attributed to something else I thought it was a lot 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.000
 most recent perhaps to justify the 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.850
 ignorance that everything happened is a 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.950
 work why I did not know it good but the 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.050
 star in programmer by line something 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.230
 Take music for example at the moment we go 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.800
 to go so the best your subsidiary we highlight 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.800
 the graphic
