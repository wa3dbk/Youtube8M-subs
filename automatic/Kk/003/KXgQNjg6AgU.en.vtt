see those there feels little three
circle<00:01:21.060> patch<00:01:21.930> things<00:01:22.729> they're<00:01:23.729> called<00:01:23.909> bends

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
circle patch things they're called bends

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.070 
circle patch things they're called bends
there's<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.259> Venn<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.400> end<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.850> each<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.450> the

I found the star had some sort of
cluster<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.320> ends<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> points<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
cluster on the ends of the points of the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.719 
cluster on the ends of the points of the
star<00:01:41.460> um<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:45.240> star<00:01:45.630> badge<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:47.570> uh<00:01:49.729> it's
