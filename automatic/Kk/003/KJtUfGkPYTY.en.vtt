00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello I'm eric heyer 97 and today in games that never came out I'll talk about being 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 fox 2 for super nintendo before it was supplanted by being fox 64 but 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.030
 yes 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.849
 he has left without a doubt it would have been the best game of the super nintendo as soon as 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.699
 potential is concerned so first I will tell the story of why that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.039
 game did not come to the sale despite being completed 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.239
 star fox 2 was a video game not released for super nintendo entertainment 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.390
 system 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.760
 was the second in the series' star fox and direct sequel to starfox 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.230
 argonauta messi nintendo produced the game 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.490
 with nintendo planning to launch or not 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.190
 the Japanese version was completed but was not yet ready to be released 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.520
 it is not known if an English version was ever completed 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.700
 star fox 2 continues the battle to stop Andrei who wants to conquer 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.550
 the lilac t-systems with the equipment being focused again to stop it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.610
 the game presents a game mode with a timer is measured at 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 besides new ships and two new members 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.440
 also presents a battle mode better than its predecessor since it 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.870
 has an improved version of the super fx chip 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 many people see to be fox eat as a successor 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.480
 since it presents many of the new functions presented by this 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.530
 game 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 the game was never released as nintendo preferred the new games 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.230
 were produced for the nintendo 64 since it had better graphics and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.229
 they wanted to use those advantages for a new game of 'star fox 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.450
 the gameplay of starfox two is very different from the original star fox 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.300
 instead of that turn in predefined way with already defined missions 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.360
 the player can move a team of two ships around the map that represents the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 idac system 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 When the player makes contact with the enemy, the game moves to another mode where 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.300
 the player can already fully control the ship and the battle is very similar 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.220
 to the original star fox when the player destroys all enemies in 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.560
 the rod screen the game returns to the map where the player decides where 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 want to go after 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.610
 The objective of the game is to destroy all the enemies present on the map 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 while defending the planet corner already located at the bottom 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.660
 left of the screen preventing the damage counter from reaching 100 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.499
 hundred 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.289
 to protect the corner and the player has to face enemy ships and 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.639
 missiles called simms 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.260
 for its acronym in English 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.839
 on the map while battle with the sources of the attacks 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.040
 battle ships 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.599
 that release small ships 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.620
 and the bases on the planets that release missiles that are fired towards corner 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.269
 already 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.329
 to help you 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.069
 General Peter uses a station and cell phone that shoots lightning 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.650
 destroy enemies 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.569
 but this one only fires a beam every so often the player has also 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.190
 to defend this station from a virus that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.299
 by infecting 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.569
 they use the cannon against cornellÃ¡ 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.809
 If the player makes contact with an enemy planet, the game leads to a 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.639
 battle zone on the surface of the planet 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.809
 you also have to open the door that allows you to enter to the base 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.659
 This can be opened in different ways depending on the level of squeezing 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.489
 a switch 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.799
 beating a robot 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.879
 etc 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.090
 once you enter the base itself 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.540
 the player has to go through the entire base to the center 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.609
 where is the core of the base and destroy it 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.139
 then the planet is released and no more missiles were fired from there 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.279
 ships of the team of mercenaries of this volta will be defending some 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.590
 dominated planets 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.629
 and they will have to be beaten to free the planet 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.049
 if you delay much 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.899
 those ships will come directly to your ship even if you are not on the planet 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.669
 robots are going to be sent by dives after some time of game 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.429
 the game straps a semi-real time when the player enters a battle 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.859
 the time begins and the enemy so hurtful will attack 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.649
 this also happens when you move around the map or enter a planet 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:51.400
 when you're off after beating an enemy and return to the map 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.379
 nobody moves in that time 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.609
 that time is for the player to think about how to defend with better 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.629
 In some cases, the player will have to leave the battle to attack 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.389
 the enemies that come close to corners and 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.319
 thus 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.850
 star fox 2 has a resemblance to real-time games 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.540
 When the player has defeated all the enemies on the map this will be 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.700
 teleported to the butt base 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.959
 located in the upper right part of the map in a last level where the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.460
 final will face andros in person 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.659
 once they have been defeated 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.599
 the player has completed the game 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.839
 your score has been recorded and your recognitions appear in another 

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.749
 screen 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.110
 the difficulty in the game is decisive 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.289
 since in each level more enemies and more challenging levels appear 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.319
 each level of difficulty contains some coins with the face of the general peter 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.749
 that at the end of the game to um as much score 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:49.139
 the game was intensely publicized in the magazines of the moment as well 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.969
 appeared on e3 in the interest of nintendo by general publicity for the 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:53.770
 game 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.020
 how veins went by to advertise some people took pictures of the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.409
 game and they put them in magazines 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.080
 These were taken using meurator 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.220
 although it seems that videos were made 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.830
 no copy was open to the public 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.699
 the lack of news of the game already finished may be due to a legal issue 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.379
 with nfl or not going 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.500
 in its beginnings 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.290
 farah fonix of being fox comic the beloved the id i in the alpha and a monkey named tsar 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.749
 a monkey in Japanese were in the place of miyuki fae 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.809
 fair replaced a sheep of unknown sex that appeared in the beginning 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.139
 of the game 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.120
 In Internet 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.030
 there are several veins of the game that were originally seen in other 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.129
 places 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.009
 another vein from before the game was canceled 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.659
 can also be found the trial version is almost complete 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.180
 but it has some errors the source code 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.300
 unfinished things like a very basic multiplayer 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.409
 these scholarships can be played in an emulator or they can be inserted in a 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.629
 snes cartridge with sf x2 inserted 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:54.800
 Additionally 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.860
 a translation can be found is fixed most errors and puts 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.749
 in play to the English language 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.759
 when you ask if the game is going to be launched to the wii virtual console or 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.919
 nintendo ds 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.860
 the designer to be fox takaya imamura said probably not 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.349
 while nintendo has not given explanations of the cancellation 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.589
 Programmer Living Fox 2 Dylan Cuthbert says 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.729
 I will be fox 2 was completed 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.969
 I was the chief programmer the reason the game was not released was that 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:27.289
 it was expected that the nintendo 64 will be introduced long before 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.430
 miyamoto sean decided he preferred to use the 64 bits of nintendo 64 for 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.860
 go from esm es to m 64 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.439
 in short we could have launched it was going to happen at least 1 year and a half before 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.199
 that the nintendo 64 was released 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.599
 members indicate that high production costs also 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.210
 influenced the cancellation 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.900
 according to dylan cuthbert 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.289
 several of the elements of the game were used in being focused p4 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.419
 shigeru miyamoto also says that the ideas of ohl ranger 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.349
 he estimates that 30% of starfox 64 and not of starfox 2 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.639
 In addition, many of the game's ideas were used in this reform, as 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.860
 the nintendo ds these ideas were to go free by the map and use the ship's 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.860
 each character with their own abilities and strengths 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:22.239
 this is all for now for the second part I'm going to put a video but 

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:26.089
 I need a game rom and a tutorial to use the hiper campero for the 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:30.569
 moment thanks and I hope you like the video says goodbye eric heyer 97 up 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:31.009
 the next
