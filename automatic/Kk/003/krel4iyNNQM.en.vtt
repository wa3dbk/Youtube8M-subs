00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
gets to choose first so let's say this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
gets to choose first so let's say this
person<00:02:05.220> here<00:02:05.400> played<00:02:05.670> wolves<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.390> person

person here played wolves this person
here<00:02:06.869> played<00:02:07.080> wolf<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> highest<00:02:07.860> thing

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
graphic design of the cards the board is

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.589 
graphic design of the cards the board is
okay<00:04:12.489> it's<00:04:12.670> beautiful<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.239> little<00:04:13.450> busy

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
okay it's beautiful it's a little busy

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.869 
okay it's beautiful it's a little busy
but<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.349> cards<00:04:14.709> are<00:04:14.829> really<00:04:15.250> gorgeous<00:04:15.579> my

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
but the cards are really gorgeous my

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.099 
but the cards are really gorgeous my
only<00:04:16.060> problem<00:04:16.180> with<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.450> cards<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.900> they<00:04:17.019> only

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
only problem with the cards is they only

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.900 
only problem with the cards is they only
of<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.320> number<00:04:17.560> into<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:17.889> corner<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.430> would

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
of the number into one corner I would

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.340 
of the number into one corner I would
prefer<00:04:19.209> they<00:04:19.359> put<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.690> all<00:04:19.810> four<00:04:20.079> corners

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
prefer they put it in all four corners

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.110 
prefer they put it in all four corners
so<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.039> can<00:04:21.190> spread<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.519> cards<00:04:21.729> flip<00:04:22.000> them

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
so you can spread the cards flip them

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.580 
so you can spread the cards flip them
upside<00:04:22.360> down<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.780> still<00:04:23.020> works

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
upside down and it still works

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.080 
upside down and it still works
that's<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.130> seems<00:04:24.280> like<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.430> simple<00:04:24.820> thing<00:04:24.850> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
that's it seems like a simple thing to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.300 
that's it seems like a simple thing to
do<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.870> card<00:04:26.110> game<00:04:26.169> that's<00:04:26.410> very<00:04:26.590> handy<00:04:26.830> it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
do in a card game that's very handy it

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.379 
do in a card game that's very handy it
doesn't<00:04:27.610> ruin<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.849> game<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.240> that's

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
doesn't ruin the game but that's

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.170 
doesn't ruin the game but that's
something<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.720> would<00:04:28.870> have<00:04:28.960> fixed<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:30.789> game<00:04:31.000> is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
something I would have fixed the game is

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
something I would have fixed the game is
interesting<00:04:31.599> because<00:04:31.660> essentially<00:04:32.050> you're

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
interesting because essentially you're

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.900 
interesting because essentially you're

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.080 
can't build some kind of pair is
probably<00:04:56.680> not<00:04:56.830> going<00:04:56.950> to<00:04:57.010> happen<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:57.490> then<00:04:58.030> you

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
probably not going to happen so then you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.700 
probably not going to happen so then you
have<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> decide<00:04:58.389> which<00:04:59.169> card<00:04:59.500> you're<00:04:59.620> gonna

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
you could play randomly and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.450 
you could play randomly and
you<00:05:20.629> wouldn't<00:05:21.080> win<00:05:21.259> but<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.069> could<00:05:22.280> say<00:05:22.430> I

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.390 
don't know I'm doing outs throw a card
out<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.990> would<00:05:24.110> still<00:05:24.289> be<00:05:24.349> easy<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.250> work

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
out and it would still be easy to work

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.920 
out and it would still be easy to work
this<00:05:25.610> is<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.789> game<00:05:25.970> I<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.180> teach<00:05:26.509> in<00:05:26.659> just<00:05:26.840> a

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
this is a game I can teach in just a

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.080 
this is a game I can teach in just a
couple<00:05:27.139> minutes<00:05:27.379> and<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:28.190> like<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.669> concept<00:05:29.030> of

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
couple minutes and I like the concept of

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.210 
couple minutes and I like the concept of
gathering<00:05:29.449> colors<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.080> numbers<00:05:30.379> and<00:05:30.560> animals

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
gathering colors and numbers and animals

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.339 
gathering colors and numbers and animals
and<00:05:31.340> none<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.580> those<00:05:31.759> three<00:05:32.120> is<00:05:32.240> as<00:05:32.750> easy<00:05:33.199> as

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
and none of those three is as easy as

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.649 
and none of those three is as easy as
the<00:05:33.770> other<00:05:33.949> although<00:05:34.310> sometimes<00:05:35.180> you'll<00:05:35.509> get

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
the other although sometimes you'll get

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.180 
the other although sometimes you'll get
caught<00:05:35.900> up<00:05:36.080> in<00:05:36.229> one<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.680> maybe<00:05:36.800> ignore

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
caught up in one and maybe ignore

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.070 
caught up in one and maybe ignore
animals<00:05:37.759> because<00:05:38.419> you're<00:05:38.539> too<00:05:38.690> busy<00:05:38.870> looking

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
animals because you're too busy looking

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.540 
animals because you're too busy looking
at<00:05:39.319> the<00:05:39.349> numbers<00:05:39.770> and<00:05:39.800> such<00:05:40.129> you<00:05:40.280> got<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.490> look

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
at the numbers and such you got to look

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.029 
at the numbers and such you got to look
at<00:05:40.669> all<00:05:40.849> of<00:05:40.940> them<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.720> fun<00:05:42.139> it's<00:05:42.409> a<00:05:42.530> fast<00:05:42.889> game

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
at all of them so fun it's a fast game

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.980 
at all of them so fun it's a fast game
too<00:05:43.430> because<00:05:43.789> you<00:05:43.909> really<00:05:43.940> can<00:05:44.509> score<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.870> lot

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
too because you really can score a lot

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.100 
too because you really can score a lot
of<00:05:45.050> points<00:05:45.139> per<00:05:45.560> round<00:05:45.610> getting<00:05:46.610> 15<00:05:47.150> 20<00:05:47.810> points

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
of points per round getting 15 20 points

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.540 
of points per round getting 15 20 points
per<00:05:48.169> round<00:05:48.379> isn't<00:05:48.680> unheard<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.310> especially

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
per round isn't unheard of especially

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.339 
per round isn't unheard of especially
with<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.330> butterflies<00:05:50.750> getting<00:05:51.080> at<00:05:51.199> their

with the butterflies getting at their

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.999 
with the butterflies getting at their
points<00:05:51.909> so<00:05:52.909> I<00:05:53.180> like<00:05:53.569> it<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.259> small<00:05:54.440> game

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009
