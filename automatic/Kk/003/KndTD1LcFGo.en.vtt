here<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.460> want<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.820> show<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.990> thing<00:01:45.290> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
here I want to show you this thing is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.219 
here I want to show you this thing is
called<00:01:45.890> mid-range<00:01:46.550> City<00:01:47.210> look<00:01:47.720> at<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.020> and

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
called mid-range City look at that and

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.230 
called mid-range City look at that and
this<00:01:48.800> thing<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:49.220> can't<00:01:49.729> even<00:01:49.880> believe<00:01:50.030> how

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
this thing I can't even believe how

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.310 
this thing I can't even believe how
heavy<00:01:50.690> this<00:01:50.900> thing<00:01:50.960> is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
heavy this thing is

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.290 
heavy this thing is
and<00:01:51.500> right<00:01:52.190> here<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.760> three-quarter

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
and right here you have a three-quarter

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.000 
and right here you have a three-quarter
inch<00:01:53.330> tweeter<00:01:53.690> so<00:01:53.930> what<00:01:54.080> happens<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.560> it's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
inch tweeter so what happens is it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.320 
inch tweeter so what happens is it's
almost<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> having<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.850> little<00:01:56.090> miniature

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
almost like a having a little miniature

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.969 
almost like a having a little miniature
component<00:01:56.960> speaker<00:01:57.229> system<00:01:57.590> when<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.830> put

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
component speaker system when you put

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.710 
component speaker system when you put
the<00:01:58.070> two<00:01:58.190> together<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.270> call<00:01:59.510> this<00:01:59.659> a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
the two together and you call this a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.980 
the two together and you call this a
coaxial<00:02:00.350> what<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> lot<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.990> instance

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
coaxial what it is is a lot of instance

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.789 
coaxial what it is is a lot of instance
which<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.979> me<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.460> great<00:02:05.390> for<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> lot<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.320> I

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
which to me is great for a lot of I

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.740 
which to me is great for a lot of I
guess<00:02:07.130> modern<00:02:07.700> music<00:02:07.970> because<00:02:08.209> modern<00:02:08.420> music

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
guess modern music because modern music

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.630 
guess modern music because modern music
is<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.170> lousy<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.100> if<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.310> listen<00:02:10.490> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is just so lousy but if you listen to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.150 
is just so lousy but if you listen to
old<00:02:10.970> stuff<00:02:11.360> like<00:02:11.630> Led<00:02:11.959> Zeppelin<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.620> Eagles

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
old stuff like Led Zeppelin and Eagles

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.430 
old stuff like Led Zeppelin and Eagles
and<00:02:13.340> good

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440

good<00:02:14.590> soulful<00:02:15.400> rock<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> roll<00:02:15.970> type<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.360> music

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
good soulful rock and roll type of music

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.780 
good soulful rock and roll type of music
that<00:02:16.810> has<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.410> benefits<00:02:18.070> from<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.580> full

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that has and benefits from all the full

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.570 
that has and benefits from all the full
range<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.470> instrumentation<00:02:20.470> these<00:02:21.280> speakers

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
range of instrumentation these speakers

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.160 
range of instrumentation these speakers
are<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> little<00:02:22.450> lackluster<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:23.080> my

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
are just a little lackluster in my

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.870 
are just a little lackluster in my
opinion<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.710> think<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.280> great<00:02:24.520> they<00:02:24.730> have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
opinion I think that is great they have

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.520 
opinion I think that is great they have
a<00:02:24.910> ton<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.270> mid<00:02:25.510> bass<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.020> certainly<00:02:26.230> do

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
a ton of mid bass and they certainly do

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.880 
a ton of mid bass and they certainly do
the<00:02:27.130> gel<00:02:27.400> coat<00:02:27.610> finish<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.180> color<00:02:28.680> finish<00:02:29.680> in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the gel coat finish the color finish in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.280 
the gel coat finish the color finish in
my<00:02:30.520> interpretation<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.780> looks<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.140> little

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
my interpretation this looks a little

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.710 
my interpretation this looks a little
bit<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.970> don't<00:02:33.970> know<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.120> has<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
bit I don't know it has this going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.530 
bit I don't know it has this going to
come<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.380> camera<00:02:35.770> but<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:37.120> box<00:02:37.330> it

I've<00:04:48.370> never<00:04:48.669> seen<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.689> allows<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.169> water

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
I've never seen and it allows the water

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.570 
I've never seen and it allows the water
as<00:04:50.620> long<00:04:50.710> as<00:04:51.039> you<00:04:51.159> mount<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.460> speaker

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
as long as you mount the speaker

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
as long as you mount the speaker
according<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.539> how<00:04:52.810> kicker<00:04:53.050> wants<00:04:53.409> because<00:04:53.560> up

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
according to how kicker wants because up

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.800 
according to how kicker wants because up
here<00:04:53.860> they<00:04:54.129> have<00:04:54.310> their<00:04:54.819> logo<00:04:55.210> if<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.419> put<00:04:55.689> it

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
here they have their logo if you put it

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.929 
here they have their logo if you put it
like<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.979> water<00:04:57.250> should<00:04:57.460> drain<00:04:57.759> directly

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
like so the water should drain directly

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.490 
like so the water should drain directly
right<00:04:58.389> out<00:04:58.509> of<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.659> speaker<00:04:58.990> without<00:04:59.139> it

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
about them have been kicker owners in

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.730 
about them have been kicker owners in
the<00:05:54.279> past<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.849> maybe<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.690> know<00:05:55.810> had<00:05:56.500> some

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
the past and maybe you know had some

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.709 
the past and maybe you know had some
wild<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.580> know<00:05:57.610> car<00:05:58.000> audio<00:05:58.270> system<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.659> they

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
wild you know car audio system and they

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.119 
wild you know car audio system and they
were<00:05:58.779> a<00:05:58.870> kid<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.229> it<00:05:59.289> just<00:05:59.319> brings<00:05:59.620> back<00:05:59.770> fond

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
were a kid and it just brings back fond

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.450 
were a kid and it just brings back fond
memories<00:06:00.159> but<00:06:00.729> I<00:06:00.759> got<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.300> keep<00:06:01.419> it<00:06:01.539> real<00:06:02.460> 65

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
memories but I got to keep it real 65

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.570 
memories but I got to keep it real 65
watts<00:06:03.759> RMS<00:06:04.300> not<00:06:05.169> so<00:06:05.409> much<00:06:05.620> I'd<00:06:05.979> say<00:06:06.009> maybe

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
watts RMS not so much I'd say maybe

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.390 
watts RMS not so much I'd say maybe
these<00:06:06.879> things<00:06:07.089> realistically<00:06:07.569> would<00:06:08.229> take<00:06:08.469> 45

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
these things realistically would take 45

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.939 
these things realistically would take 45
to<00:06:09.909> 50<00:06:10.240> before<00:06:10.389> they<00:06:10.750> distort<00:06:11.169> and<00:06:11.409> especially

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
to 50 before they distort and especially

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.800 
to 50 before they distort and especially
if<00:06:12.099> they're<00:06:12.580> crossed<00:06:12.849> over<00:06:13.060> properly<00:06:13.479> because

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
if they're crossed over properly because

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.629 
if they're crossed over properly because
you<00:06:13.930> can't<00:06:14.110> run<00:06:14.289> super<00:06:14.680> subsonic<00:06:15.219> frequencies

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
you can't run super subsonic frequencies

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.249 
you can't run super subsonic frequencies
through<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.330> speakers<00:06:16.629> because<00:06:16.810> they<00:06:16.930> simply

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
through the speakers because they simply

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.260 
through the speakers because they simply
cannot<00:06:17.500> tolerate<00:06:17.770> it<00:06:18.129> although<00:06:18.849> that<00:06:19.150> their

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
cannot tolerate it although that their

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.600 
cannot tolerate it although that their
ratings<00:06:19.569> say<00:06:20.289> that<00:06:20.439> they<00:06:20.560> would<00:06:20.800> in<00:06:21.039> all

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
ratings say that they would in all

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.170 
ratings say that they would in all

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.540 
reality
no<00:06:22.629> they<00:06:22.930> won't<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.289> no<00:06:23.830> six-and-a-half<00:06:24.219> in

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
no they won't and no six-and-a-half in

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.129 
no they won't and no six-and-a-half in
my<00:06:24.699> opinion<00:06:25.089> really<00:06:25.330> that<00:06:25.569> I've<00:06:25.659> ever<00:06:25.810> seen

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
my opinion really that I've ever seen

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.809 
my opinion really that I've ever seen
with<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.860> exception<00:06:27.219> of<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.370> couple<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.759> just

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
with the exception of a couple that just

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.570 
with the exception of a couple that just
costs<00:06:28.360> way<00:06:28.779> too<00:06:28.839> much<00:06:29.199> and<00:06:29.860> then<00:06:30.219> nobody<00:06:30.460> would

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
costs way too much and then nobody would

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.339 
costs way too much and then nobody would
buy<00:06:30.729> because<00:06:31.089> the<00:06:31.240> too<00:06:31.330> expensive<00:06:31.599> can

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
buy because the too expensive can

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.899 
buy because the too expensive can
actually<00:06:32.860> handle<00:06:33.189> in<00:06:33.400> a<00:06:33.490> real<00:06:33.699> day-to-day

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
actually handle in a real day-to-day

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.839 
actually handle in a real day-to-day
basis<00:06:34.479> so<00:06:34.659> overall<00:06:35.289> I'd<00:06:36.129> give<00:06:36.189> these<00:06:36.550> speakers

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
basis so overall I'd give these speakers
