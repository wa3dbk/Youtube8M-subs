we're starting on the roof on the
terrace<00:00:50.540> which<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.140> an<00:00:51.350> extra<00:00:51.830> extra<00:00:52.190> floor

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
and you know lots of stairs you got big

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.869 
and you know lots of stairs you got big
jobs<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.540> got<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.780> little<00:00:57.230> step<00:00:57.470> up<00:00:57.680> like<00:00:57.980> berms

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
jobs you got a little step up like berms

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.759 
jobs you got a little step up like berms
like<00:00:59.300> basically<00:00:59.720> it's<00:00:59.989> everything<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:00.680> you

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
like basically it's everything what you

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.829 
like basically it's everything what you
can<00:01:00.949> build<00:01:01.129> outside<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.089> urban<00:01:02.239> race<00:01:02.570> but

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
can build outside on the urban race but

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.350 
can build outside on the urban race but
it's<00:01:03.019> everything<00:01:03.500> under<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.890> roof<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:04.460> that's

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
it's everything under the roof so that's

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:18.870 
it's everything under the roof so that's
pretty<00:01:05.630> cool

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120 

downhill<00:01:19.750> we<00:01:20.020> normally<00:01:20.380> rest<00:01:20.710> against<00:01:21.070> the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
downhill we normally rest against the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.580 
downhill we normally rest against the
clock<00:01:21.400> on<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.730> ski<00:01:22.450> slopes<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:23.050> on<00:01:23.260> roots

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
clock on the ski slopes like on roots

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.530 
clock on the ski slopes like on roots
and<00:01:23.740> rocks<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.220> mud<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.730> now<00:01:25.030> we're<00:01:25.270> riding

but a nasty nasty Osman which I would

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.340 
but a nasty nasty Osman which I would
need<00:01:53.830> free<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.369> interests<00:01:54.910> Romo<00:01:55.869> suppose

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
need free so interests Romo suppose

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:21.650 
need free so interests Romo suppose
voila<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.700> probabilities<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.660> steam

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.710 

I<00:02:21.860> would<00:02:22.860> say<00:02:23.040> you've<00:02:23.250> pretty<00:02:23.580> reach<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.150> 40

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
I would say you've pretty reach like 40

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260 
I would say you've pretty reach like 40
kilometres<00:02:24.990> an<00:02:25.380> hour<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:26.250> bits<00:02:26.550> maybe<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> bit

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
kilometres an hour in bits maybe a bit

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.440 
kilometres an hour in bits maybe a bit
more<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.070> do<00:02:29.370> go<00:02:29.550> pretty<00:02:29.850> fast

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
more so if you do go pretty fast

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.920 
more so if you do go pretty fast
the<00:02:30.900> main<00:02:31.080> kids<00:02:31.380> adapt<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.340> quick<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.360> all

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the main kids adapt really quick to all

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.810 
the main kids adapt really quick to all
the<00:02:34.110> obstacles<00:02:34.320> all<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> parts<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
the obstacles all the parts because you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.630 
the obstacles all the parts because you
have<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> limited<00:02:36.510> time<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.230> practice<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.860> then

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
have a limited time to practice and then

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.700 
have a limited time to practice and then
only<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.390> family<00:02:39.630> run<00:02:39.960> which<00:02:40.200> shows

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
only one family run which shows

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.820 
only one family run which shows
everything<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.600> very<00:02:42.810> technical<00:02:43.050> for

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
everything it's not very technical for

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.070 
everything it's not very technical for
us<00:02:43.920> because<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.150> surviving<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.720> lot<00:02:45.900> bigger

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
us because we use surviving a lot bigger

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.520 
us because we use surviving a lot bigger
jumps<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.560> drop-offs<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.250> obviously<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.210> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
jumps and drop-offs but obviously for a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.750 
jumps and drop-offs but obviously for a
spectator<00:02:49.530> who's<00:02:49.650> never<00:02:49.860> seen<00:02:50.160> anything<00:02:50.730> like

some<00:04:00.480> happy<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.870> be<00:04:01.050> beaten<00:04:01.910> quite<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.030> right

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.880 
some happy to be beaten quite the right
there<00:04:03.420> like<00:04:04.340> Phil<00:04:05.340> approached<00:04:06.650> it's<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.860> a

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
there like Phil approached it's not a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.400 
there like Phil approached it's not a
shame<00:04:08.600> towards<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.690> finals<00:04:10.140> we've<00:04:10.260> been

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
shame towards the finals we've been

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.350 
shame towards the finals we've been
getting<00:04:10.650> faster<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.100> faster<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.820> drums

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
getting faster and faster so the drums

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.750 
getting faster and faster so the drums
were<00:04:12.600> smaller<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.170> smaller<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:14.430> was<00:04:14.610> quite

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
were smaller and smaller so it was quite

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.210 
were smaller and smaller so it was quite
hard<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.240> keep<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.140> landings<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:17.040> was

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
hard to keep the landings because I was

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.550 
hard to keep the landings because I was
overshooting<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> jumps<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.510> level<00:04:19.440> of

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
overshooting the jumps and the level of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.930 
overshooting the jumps and the level of
riding<00:04:19.769> was<00:04:20.070> pretty<00:04:20.370> high

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.940 

I<00:04:26.970> think<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.080> is<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.290> right<00:04:28.470> way<00:04:28.710> because

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
I think this is the right way because

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.740 
I think this is the right way because
you<00:04:29.490> know<00:04:29.610> these<00:04:29.850> people<00:04:30.090> what<00:04:30.300> we've<00:04:30.570> seen

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
you know these people what we've seen

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.470 
you know these people what we've seen
today<00:04:30.930> here<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:32.010> don't<00:04:32.640> think<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.060> they<00:04:33.240> will

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
today here I don't think that they will

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.030 
today here I don't think that they will
normally<00:04:33.690> come<00:04:34.170> for<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> raise<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:34.950> the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
normally come for the raise in the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040 
normally come for the raise in the
mountain<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.640> why<00:04:36.330> don't<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.570> bring<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.870> race

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
mountain so why don't you bring the race

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.130 
mountain so why don't you bring the race
