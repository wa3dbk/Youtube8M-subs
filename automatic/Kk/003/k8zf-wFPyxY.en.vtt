00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
think oh this is a I forgot to check out

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.660 
think oh this is a I forgot to check out
the<00:02:16.870> map<00:02:17.019> before<00:02:17.200> him<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.800> odd<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the map before him this is odd I it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
the map before him this is odd I it
looks<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.269> sent<00:02:19.690> his<00:02:19.870> STD<00:02:20.230> around<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
looks like you sent his STD around the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.070 
looks like you sent his STD around the
side<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:21.940> must<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.390> poor<00:02:22.599> map<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.959> was

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
side so it must be a to poor map it was

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.650 
side so it must be a to poor map it was
05<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.769> don't<00:02:23.890> stand<00:02:24.269> thrown<00:02:25.269> all<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.569> way

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
05 we don't stand thrown all the way

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.930 
05 we don't stand thrown all the way
across<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.739> middle<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.250> but<00:02:27.519> flash

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
across the middle like that but flash

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.790 
across the middle like that but flash
for<00:02:28.150> some<00:02:28.269> reason<00:02:28.510> has<00:02:28.630> sent<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.989> STD<00:02:29.319> around

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
for some reason has sent is STD around

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.009 
for some reason has sent is STD around
the<00:02:30.010> side<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.430> avoid<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.910> path<00:02:31.090> no<00:02:31.360> milord<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
the side to avoid the path no milord I

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.620 
the side to avoid the path no milord I
think<00:02:32.830> unless<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.280> ground<00:02:33.760> cap<00:02:34.030> doesn't<00:02:34.420> work

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
think unless the ground cap doesn't work

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.789 
think unless the ground cap doesn't work
there<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> thought<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.290> was<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.440> girl<00:02:35.590> back

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799

um<00:06:01.190> more<00:06:02.190> turrets<00:06:02.580> going<00:06:02.820> up<00:06:02.940> if<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.240> get<00:06:03.390> a

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
um more turrets going up if you get a

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.120 
um more turrets going up if you get a
second<00:06:03.840> turn<00:06:03.990> up<00:06:04.169> next<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.560> those<00:06:04.710> racks<00:06:04.979> that

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
second turn up next to those racks that

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.890 
second turn up next to those racks that
will<00:06:05.280> be<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.370> very<00:06:05.580> very<00:06:05.790> good<00:06:06.000> thing<00:06:06.630> from<00:06:06.780> you

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
will be a very very good thing from you

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.070 
will be a very very good thing from you
have<00:06:07.050> his<00:06:07.919> natural<00:06:08.460> probably<00:06:08.790> has<00:06:08.940> soft<00:06:09.840> three

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
have his natural probably has soft three

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.270 
have his natural probably has soft three
I<00:06:10.110> think<00:06:10.380> turrets<00:06:10.650> going<00:06:10.830> up<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:11.010> probably

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
I think turrets going up you probably

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.560 
I think turrets going up you probably
put<00:06:11.370> out<00:06:11.490> more<00:06:11.640> so<00:06:11.820> he<00:06:11.880> probably<00:06:12.060> four<00:06:12.390> or<00:06:12.419> five

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
put out more so he probably four or five

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.020 
put out more so he probably four or five
turns<00:06:12.780> into<00:06:12.930> natural<00:06:13.140> so<00:06:13.740> okay<00:06:14.520> no<00:06:14.700> just<00:06:14.910> the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
turns into natural so okay no just the

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.240 
turns into natural so okay no just the
three<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.240> guess<00:06:15.450> oh<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.710> bunker<00:06:16.979> as<00:06:17.070> well

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
three I guess oh the bunker as well

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.440 
three I guess oh the bunker as well
though<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:17.580> that's<00:06:17.729> going<00:06:17.850> to<00:06:17.910> be<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.060> big<00:06:18.240> thing

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
though so that's going to be a big thing

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.360 
though so that's going to be a big thing
and<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:19.110> if<00:06:19.200> he<00:06:19.320> can<00:06:19.440> just<00:06:19.470> keep<00:06:19.800> up<00:06:20.040> with<00:06:20.250> the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
and so if he can just keep up with the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.810 
and so if he can just keep up with the
turret<00:06:20.669> production<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:22.290> just<00:06:22.740> defend<00:06:23.370> defend

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
turret production and just defend defend

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.280 
turret production and just defend defend
defend<00:06:23.910> ease<00:06:24.419> should<00:06:24.840> be<00:06:24.990> in<00:06:25.080> good<00:06:25.229> shape

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
defend ease should be in good shape

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.409 
defend ease should be in good shape
that's<00:06:25.620> kind<00:06:25.890> of<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.130> style<00:06:26.400> that's<00:06:27.090> going<00:06:27.360> to

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
that's kind of the style that's going to

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.969 
that's kind of the style that's going to
work<00:06:27.539> against<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.050> early<00:06:28.440> pressure<00:06:28.680> you

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
work against this early pressure you

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.410 
work against this early pressure you
just<00:06:29.190> need<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.460> defend<00:06:29.760> because

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
just need to defend because

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.020 
just need to defend because
skimp<00:06:30.870> on<00:06:31.020> defenses<00:06:31.770> then<00:06:32.460> you<00:06:32.670> end<00:06:32.820> up<00:06:32.880> being

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
skimp on defenses then you end up being

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.550 
skimp on defenses then you end up being
probably<00:06:33.270> putting<00:06:33.570> our<00:06:33.780> third<00:06:33.990> raxxess<00:06:34.410> was

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
probably putting our third raxxess was

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.650 
probably putting our third raxxess was
good<00:06:34.710> too<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:34.980> it<00:06:35.070> squeezes<00:06:35.340> coin<00:06:36.060> down<00:06:36.330> low

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
good too and it squeezes coin down low

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.320 
good too and it squeezes coin down low
well<00:06:37.560> this<00:06:37.770> is<00:06:37.830> crazy<00:06:38.130> he's<00:06:38.760> getting<00:06:38.910> a<00:06:39.060> third

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
well this is crazy he's getting a third

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.390 
well this is crazy he's getting a third
hatchery<00:06:39.780> in<00:06:39.870> that<00:06:39.990> bottom<00:06:40.350> left<00:06:40.890> corner<00:06:41.100> and

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
hatchery in that bottom left corner and

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.340 
hatchery in that bottom left corner and
oh<00:06:41.520> i<00:06:41.880> remember<00:06:42.000> this<00:06:42.360> map<00:06:42.660> now<00:06:42.900> because<00:06:43.230> the

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
oh i remember this map now because the

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.070 
oh i remember this map now because the
bottom<00:06:43.650> left<00:06:43.830> corner<00:06:44.360> expansion<00:06:45.360> has<00:06:45.510> two<00:06:45.780> gas

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
bottom left corner expansion has two gas

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.560 
bottom left corner expansion has two gas
mines<00:06:46.410> so<00:06:46.980> if<00:06:47.070> he<00:06:47.190> can<00:06:47.310> get<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.700> pleat<00:06:48.180> even<00:06:48.450> get

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
mines so if he can get a pleat even get

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.660 
mines so if he can get a pleat even get
a<00:06:48.600> high<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:49.110> get<00:06:49.500> those<00:06:49.680> two<00:06:49.950> gasps<00:06:50.190> moans<00:06:50.490> the
