00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.640
 Peugeot citroÃ«n maximum wine test 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.500
 to do 3 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.100
 for this case we are going to use a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.990
 multifunction team 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.990
 the gf 02 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.619
 for coil injectors and step by step in 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.730
 first instance we will act the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 piping the coil 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.920
 with his mass references with his 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.329
 food and especially and as always 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.399
 we emphasize 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.920
 verify the correct 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 connected to your hairstyle we have the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.969
 boss output 02 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.719
 red wire that is the positive 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.440
 feeding to their respective pin and the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.839
 black cable in this case bridged to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.839
 test in parallel the two coils 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.759
 regular team 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.759
 it is understood 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.410
 moving 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.350
 obinna 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.280
 the reduced 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.369
 have to stretch what the subway guy 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.369
 adjustable 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.680
 and what we're going to look for is the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.770
 thermal protection of the equipment 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.789
 channels 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.789
 greater load 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.500
 activating the driver demanding more 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.980
 guess 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.980
 we mark the revolutions to the child 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.350
 esther 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.780
 what we are seeing 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.520
 that protection was activated and also the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 electronic equipment protection 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.410
 we are having a pulse 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.930
 what are we going to do now let's cut 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.799
 hope that international protection 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.799
 establish 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.760
 we wait a few seconds 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.870
 and we give again 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.870
 do not 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.020
 this 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.920
 we have the team again
