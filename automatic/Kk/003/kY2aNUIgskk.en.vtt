00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
was a miracle to me I was so excited one
of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> best<00:01:17.189> things<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.509> nutribullet

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
of the best things about the nutribullet

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
of the best things about the nutribullet
is<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> blender<00:01:21.210> it's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
is that it's not a blender it's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
is that it's not a blender it's
something<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.470> polarizes<00:01:23.100> everything<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
something that polarizes everything that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
something that polarizes everything that
you<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.830> you're<00:01:25.830> extracting<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you put in it and you're extracting the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
you put in it and you're extracting the
nutrients<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.900> whole<00:01:28.140> foods<00:01:28.530> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
nutrients out of these whole foods so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
nutrients out of these whole foods so
you're<00:01:29.340> getting<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> maximum<00:01:29.850> benefit<00:01:30.689> by

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you're getting the maximum benefit by

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.359 
you're getting the maximum benefit by
everything<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.590> you're<00:01:31.710> putting<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.159> there

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
everything that you're putting in there

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.740 
everything that you're putting in there
the<00:01:32.759> vegetables<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.200> fruits<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.520> booths<00:01:35.909> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the vegetables the fruits the booths all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.679 
the vegetables the fruits the booths all
are<00:01:37.430> going<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:38.970> system<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.540> don't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
are going right into my system I don't

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
are going right into my system I don't
think<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.320> body<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> work<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.280> hard

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think that my body has to work as hard

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
think that my body has to work as hard
to<00:01:41.579> digest<00:01:41.820> anymore<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.259> able<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to digest anymore so now it's able to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
to digest anymore so now it's able to
absorb<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> nutrients<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.750> know

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
absorb all the nutrients that you know

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
absorb all the nutrients that you know
from<00:01:46.259> vegetables<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> from<00:01:47.280> fruits<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.149> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
from vegetables and from fruits and it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
from vegetables and from fruits and it's
probably<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.110> three<00:01:49.500> weeks<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
probably about three weeks into the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.639 
probably about three weeks into the
program<00:01:50.810> my<00:01:51.810> hair<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.200> went<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
program my hair just went through this
