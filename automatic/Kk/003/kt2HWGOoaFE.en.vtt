00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
all finished I planned out about seven

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.630 
all finished I planned out about seven
layers<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.470> tinfoil<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
layers of tinfoil it's gonna be in a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.789 
layers of tinfoil it's gonna be in a
really<00:01:29.970> hot<00:01:30.150> area<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> keep<00:01:31.650> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really hot area I want to keep it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.420 
really hot area I want to keep it
protected<00:01:33.229> when<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.380> wrap<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:35.040> usually

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
protected when we wrap it we usually

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
protected when we wrap it we usually
keep<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.909> shiny<00:01:36.540> side<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> tin<00:01:37.320> foil<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
keep the shiny side of the tin foil in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.390 
keep the shiny side of the tin foil in
oh<00:01:39.140> no<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> guess<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.619> supposed<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.189> reflect

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
oh no I guess it's supposed to reflect

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.660 
oh no I guess it's supposed to reflect
the<00:01:41.820> heat<00:01:42.030> color<00:01:43.040> could<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.189> an<00:01:44.310> old<00:01:44.460> wives

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the heat color could be an old wives

00:01:44.670 --> 00:02:03.700 
the heat color could be an old wives

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
think about seven sheets of foil some

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.900 
think about seven sheets of foil some
different<00:02:11.430> wrappings<00:02:12.379> and<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:14.610> I'm<00:02:14.730> just

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910
