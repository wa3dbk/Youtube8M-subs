00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
two attachments the silencer and rapid

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
two attachments the silencer and rapid
fire<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> iron<00:00:41.579> sight

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
fire I don't really like the iron sight

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
fire I don't really like the iron sight
so<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> third<00:00:43.079> attachment<00:00:43.530> with

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so if you get a third attachment with

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
so if you get a third attachment with
the<00:00:44.250> perk<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> red<00:00:46.050> dot<00:00:46.350> or

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the perk you can also use a red dot or

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
the perk you can also use a red dot or
maybe<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> holographic<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.579> any<00:00:47.820> other<00:00:48.120> side

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
maybe a holographic or any other side

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
maybe a holographic or any other side
you<00:00:49.200> prefer<00:00:49.469> using<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> submachine<00:00:51.090> gun<00:00:51.329> if

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
you prefer using on a submachine gun if

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
you prefer using on a submachine gun if
you're<00:00:51.510> only<00:00:51.780> using<00:00:52.170> two<00:00:52.440> attachment<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you're only using two attachment I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
you're only using two attachment I
strongly<00:00:54.180> highly<00:00:54.840> recommend<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> getting<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
strongly highly recommend you getting a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090 
strongly highly recommend you getting a
silencer<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.210> sure<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> silencer

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
silencer for sure because the silencer

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
silencer for sure because the silencer
makes<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.579> invisible<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> map<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
makes you invisible on the map when you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.869 
makes you invisible on the map when you
shoot<00:01:01.140> someone<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> rapid<00:01:02.070> fire<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
shoot someone and rapid fire to of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.979 
shoot someone and rapid fire to of
course<00:01:03.149> well<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> doesn't<00:01:03.719> make<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
course well it doesn't make you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
course well it doesn't make you
invisible<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> kills<00:01:05.220> people<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
invisible but it kills people really

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 
invisible but it kills people really
quickly<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> only<00:01:09.119> problem

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
quickly as you can see the only problem

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
quickly as you can see the only problem
is<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.049> long<00:01:10.470> distances<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.610> long-range

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
is that on long distances on long-range

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
is that on long distances on long-range
if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.869> shoot<00:01:13.170> someone<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.070> pretty

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
if you shoot someone you get some pretty

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.359 
if you shoot someone you get some pretty
bad<00:01:14.670> recoil<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.810> besides<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.650> easy<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
bad recoil but besides that it's easy to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
bad recoil but besides that it's easy to
control<00:01:17.759> recoil<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.990> close<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
control recoil and we are close up to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
control recoil and we are close up to
someone<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.880> easy<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> kill<00:01:21.780> someone

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
someone it's really easy to kill someone

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
someone it's really easy to kill someone
to<00:01:22.409> another<00:01:22.950> awesome<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.330> about

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to another awesome thing I like about

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
to another awesome thing I like about
this<00:01:24.659> gun<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.890> run<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this gun is that you don't run out of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
this gun is that you don't run out of
bullets<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.090> fast<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:27.930> though<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> fire

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
bullets that fast even though the fire

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
bullets that fast even though the fire
rate<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.189> high<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.700> you're<00:01:30.390> running

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
rate is really high and you're running

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140 
rate is really high and you're running
rapid<00:01:31.140> fire<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.159> still<00:01:32.490> kill<00:01:32.790> someone

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
rapid fire you can still kill someone

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050 
rapid fire you can still kill someone
easily<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.079> five<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.650> ten<00:01:34.860> bullets<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.790> also

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
easily with five to ten bullets I also

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
easily with five to ten bullets I also
never<00:01:36.540> run<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> ammo<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:38.130> I'm

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
never run out of ammo because I'm

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
never run out of ammo because I'm
running<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.670> scavenger<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you tend to run over bodies and pick up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
you tend to run over bodies and pick up

that<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.810> fast

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that are really fast

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
that are really fast
as<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.740> can<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> final<00:02:15.090> killcam

really quickly so when you're in a 1v1

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.700 
really quickly so when you're in a 1v1
you're<00:02:23.670> pretty<00:02:24.060> much<00:02:24.420> sorted<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
you're pretty much sorted with this
