00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
half thousand rpm and then it all comes

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.890 
half thousand rpm and then it all comes
on<00:03:31.470> instantly<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.330> lot<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.630> fun<00:03:33.780> to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
sort of driving in general and I think

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.380 
sort of driving in general and I think
that<00:03:55.650> traditional<00:03:56.650> track<00:03:56.860> driving<00:03:57.390> really

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that traditional track driving really

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.770 
that traditional track driving really
helps<00:03:58.780> sort<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.590> improve<00:04:00.239> basic<00:04:01.239> driver

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
helps sort of improve basic driver

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.770 
helps sort of improve basic driver
skills<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.409> keeps<00:04:02.739> your<00:04:02.920> eye<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.610> speak

level of excitement you have to do

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.170 
level of excitement you have to do
something<00:07:26.840> even<00:07:27.169> more<00:07:27.530> stupid<00:07:28.130> and<00:07:28.280> even<00:07:29.000> more

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
something even more stupid and even more

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.480 
something even more stupid and even more
extreme<00:07:29.630> the<00:07:29.780> next<00:07:30.020> time<00:07:30.199> so<00:07:30.830> where<00:07:31.009> that<00:07:31.190> ends

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
extreme the next time so where that ends

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.840 
extreme the next time so where that ends
exactly<00:07:32.030> I<00:07:32.060> really<00:07:32.600> don't<00:07:32.780> know<00:07:32.900> but<00:07:33.490> it<00:07:34.490> might

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
exactly I really don't know but it might

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.630 
exactly I really don't know but it might
get<00:07:35.000> pretty<00:07:35.210> silly
