00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.930 

we<00:00:06.600> built<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.960> cube<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.589> burning<00:00:07.890> man<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.280> 2009

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we built a cube for burning man in 2009

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.060 
we built a cube for burning man in 2009
and<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.750> not<00:00:09.900> unusual<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.380> people<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.889> build

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and it's not unusual for people to build

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.720 
and it's not unusual for people to build
large<00:00:11.670> versions<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:13.429> common<00:00:14.429> household

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
large versions of common household

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.820 
large versions of common household
objects<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:16.139> Burning<00:00:16.350> Man<00:00:16.379> part<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
objects for Burning Man part of the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.290 
objects for Burning Man part of the
experience<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.310> also<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.730> people<00:00:18.000> go<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
experience is also that people go and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
experience is also that people go and
play<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.960> arch<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.410> unlike<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.800> an<00:00:19.859> art

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
play with the arch so unlike in an art

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.640 
play with the arch so unlike in an art
gallery<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.460> expected<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:21.029> at<00:00:21.150> stuff

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
gallery we expected to look at stuff

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.880 
gallery we expected to look at stuff
only<00:00:23.060> there<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.269> you're<00:00:25.019> encouraged<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.680> fact

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
only there you you're encouraged in fact

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.849 
only there you you're encouraged in fact
to<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.460> mess<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> art<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:28.560> play<00:00:28.740> with

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to to mess with the art and to play with

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.109 
to to mess with the art and to play with
it<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> art<00:00:29.670> objects<00:00:30.029> are

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it and so a lot of the art objects are

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
it and so a lot of the art objects are
highly<00:00:30.300> interactive<00:00:30.599> either<00:00:31.289> physically<00:00:31.800> or

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
highly interactive either physically or

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
highly interactive either physically or
electronically<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.149> way<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.870> was

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
electronically or in some way it was

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.270 
electronically or in some way it was
pretty<00:00:34.140> clear<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.649> had<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> idea<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
pretty clear when we had the idea to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.580 
pretty clear when we had the idea to
build<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.270> giant<00:00:36.510> Rubik's<00:00:36.809> Cube<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.500> we

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
build a giant Rubik's Cube when we

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
build a giant Rubik's Cube when we
thought<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> play<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.879> got

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
thought about how to play it you got

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.610 
thought about how to play it you got
into<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.420> problem<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.469> really

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
into this problem that it would really

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
into this problem that it would really
be<00:00:40.710> only<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.280> person<00:00:41.760> who<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
be only one person who could have the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590 
be only one person who could have the
experience<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
experience and so how does that really

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.500 
experience and so how does that really
interesting<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.850> majority<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> people

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
interesting to the majority of people

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.970 
interesting to the majority of people
the<00:00:48.690> majority<00:00:48.780> people<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> looking<00:00:49.649> on

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the majority people will be looking on

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.189 
the majority people will be looking on
and<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.820> thought<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.390> having<00:00:51.840> someone

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and so we thought about having someone

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
and so we thought about having someone
inside<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> cube<00:00:52.890> originally<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> cube

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
inside the cube originally so the cube

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
inside the cube originally so the cube
root<00:00:54.149> someone<00:00:54.690> sitting<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.620> cube<00:00:55.800> solving

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
root someone sitting in the cube solving

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.260 
root someone sitting in the cube solving
it<00:00:56.190> from<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> inside<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> course<00:00:57.149> then

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it from the inside and of course then

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.490 
it from the inside and of course then
nobody<00:00:57.570> could<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.140> what's<00:00:58.320> going

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
nobody could actually see what's going

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.200 
nobody could actually see what's going
on<00:00:58.590> oh<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> cube<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
on oh they would see is a cube that is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
on oh they would see is a cube that is
moving<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.859> said<00:01:02.039> okay<00:01:02.219> let's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
moving when we when we said okay let's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.170 
moving when we when we said okay let's
take<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> person<00:01:02.879> outside<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.449> cube<00:01:03.979> I

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
take the person outside the cube I

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710 
take the person outside the cube I
suddenly<00:01:06.180> thought<00:01:06.330> well<00:01:06.750> maybe<00:01:06.890> if<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.720> give

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
suddenly thought well maybe if we give

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.410 
suddenly thought well maybe if we give
each<00:01:09.900> person<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.560> axis<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.939> something

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
each person only one axis then something

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.359 
each person only one axis then something
you<00:01:12.510> need<00:01:12.659> three<00:01:12.840> people<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> three

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you need three people and then the three

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
you need three people and then the three
people<00:01:14.549> sort<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> naturally<00:01:15.780> place

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
people sort of naturally place

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
people sort of naturally place
themselves<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.009> cube<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
themselves around the cube and the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.859 
themselves around the cube and the
symmetry<00:01:18.180> actually<00:01:18.450> works<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.720> really

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
symmetry actually works out really

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.109 
symmetry actually works out really
nicely<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.520> sort<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.880> fell<00:01:21.090> into

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
nicely and in sort of all fell into

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.030 
nicely and in sort of all fell into
place<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:22.020> turns<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.740> kind<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
place it turns this into a kind of a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
place it turns this into a kind of a
spectacle<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.570> get<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
spectacle because now you get to see a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
spectacle because now you get to see a
little<00:01:25.740> bit<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.369> only<00:01:26.820> goes<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> your

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
little bit of what only goes on in your

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.850 
little bit of what only goes on in your
head<00:01:27.630> typically<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.439> you're<00:01:28.590> making

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
head typically when you're making

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230 
head typically when you're making
decisions<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.579> move<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> next

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
decisions about what move to do next

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
decisions about what move to do next
because<00:01:30.750> you're<00:01:30.900> splitting<00:01:31.140> three<00:01:31.500> people

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
because you're splitting three people

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
because you're splitting three people
we're<00:01:31.920> forcing<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.520> communication<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
we're forcing that communication out of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're forcing that communication out of
your<00:01:33.750> brain<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.250> open<00:01:35.520> air<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
your brain into the open air so it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
your brain into the open air so it
actually<00:01:36.689> started<00:01:37.229> at<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> ski<00:01:38.100> trip<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
actually started at a ski trip to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.350 
actually started at a ski trip to
whistler<00:01:38.720> somebody<00:01:39.720> brought<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:41.460> series<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
whistler somebody brought up a series of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
whistler somebody brought up a series of
cubes<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.110> people<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.560> starting<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.829> play

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
cubes and people are starting to play

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.210 
cubes and people are starting to play
with<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.350> playing<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> 19<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.070> like

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with them and playing with it 19 is like

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
with them and playing with it 19 is like
no<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.549> make<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.850> object<00:01:48.329> much<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.500> more

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
no would make this object much much more

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
no would make this object much much more
fun<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.610> lit<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> Sun<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
fun as if it was lit up like the Sun and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
fun as if it was lit up like the Sun and
gigantic<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> middle<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
gigantic and out in the middle of the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
gigantic and out in the middle of the
desert<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> core<00:01:54.630> structure<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.140> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
desert this is a core structure and this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.130 
desert this is a core structure and this
is<00:01:55.409> custom<00:01:55.799> machined<00:01:56.100> aluminum<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.990> set

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is custom machined aluminum and it's set

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
is custom machined aluminum and it's set
up<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.710> outer<00:01:59.270> structure<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.450> going

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
up so that the outer structure is going

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.060 
up so that the outer structure is going
to<00:02:00.719> exactly<00:02:00.960> match<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to exactly match what you want for the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.620 
to exactly match what you want for the
cube<00:02:02.340> become

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
cube become

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
cube become
around<00:02:03.899> behind<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.979> so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
around behind you can actually see so

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
around behind you can actually see so
these<00:02:05.939> guys<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.180> reflectors<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
these guys are reflectors so if you just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
these guys are reflectors so if you just
put<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> bright<00:02:08.160> light<00:02:08.459> behind<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.390> fabric

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
put a bright light behind that fabric

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900 
put a bright light behind that fabric
you'd<00:02:10.319> end<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.099> really<00:02:11.459> bright

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you'd end up with this one really bright

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
you'd end up with this one really bright
spot<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> rest<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
spot and then the rest of it would be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.620 
spot and then the rest of it would be
kind<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.830> dim<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.640> instead<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.300> we've<00:02:15.450> done

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
kind of dim so instead what we've done

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.920 
kind of dim so instead what we've done
is<00:02:15.870> we've<00:02:16.019> mounted<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.040> lights<00:02:17.510> backwards<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
is we've mounted the lights backwards so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
is we've mounted the lights backwards so
they're<00:02:19.110> actually<00:02:19.230> shooting<00:02:19.650> into<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
they're actually shooting into this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
they're actually shooting into this
mylar<00:02:21.780> sheath<00:02:22.080> which<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.590> serving<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
mylar sheath which is serving as a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
mylar sheath which is serving as a
reflector<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> get<00:02:24.030> light<00:02:24.330> bouncing

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
reflector so that you get light bouncing

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.059 
reflector so that you get light bouncing
around<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.290> nice<00:02:25.560> matte

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
around you get this nice matte

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.190 
around you get this nice matte
reflection<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.209> out<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.630> these<00:02:28.110> are

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
reflection all the way out and these are

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.630 
reflection all the way out and these are
actually<00:02:28.470> reclaimed<00:02:28.830> cardboard<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.459> came

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
actually reclaimed cardboard this came

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually reclaimed cardboard this came
from<00:02:29.819> dumpsters<00:02:30.599> at<00:02:30.930> some<00:02:31.110> point<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> past

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
from dumpsters at some point in the past

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.320 
from dumpsters at some point in the past
because<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.819> were<00:02:32.910> funding<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.300> project

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
because we were funding the project

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330 
because we were funding the project
ourselves<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.380> there's<00:02:34.560> mylar<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
ourselves and then there's mylar on the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.630 
ourselves and then there's mylar on the
inside<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.130> corner

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
inside of it so you see this is a corner

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.210 
inside of it so you see this is a corner
QV<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:40.019> one<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.709> them<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.010> each

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
QV so there's one of them in each

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.729 
QV so there's one of them in each
direction<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.690> how<00:02:42.989> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
direction you can see how the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.490 
direction you can see how the
electronics<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.580> routed<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:46.200> all<00:02:46.470> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
electronics are routed in so all of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.289 
electronics are routed in so all of
these<00:02:46.799> guys<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.459> electronics<00:02:48.150> which

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
these guys will have electronics which

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.940 
these guys will have electronics which
are<00:02:48.420> routed<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> center<00:02:49.470> square<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
are routed back to a center square and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.520 
are routed back to a center square and
will<00:02:50.489> have<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:51.540> boxes<00:02:52.019> which<00:02:52.230> are<00:02:52.349> mounted

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
will have little boxes which are mounted

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.970 
will have little boxes which are mounted
each<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.099> those<00:02:53.250> boxes<00:02:53.790> will<00:02:54.090> drive<00:02:54.900> five<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
each of those boxes will drive five of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.100 
each of those boxes will drive five of
these<00:02:56.370> faces<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.209> there<00:02:57.360> will<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.540> 11<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.989> those

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
these faces so there will be 11 of those

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.520 
these faces so there will be 11 of those
boxes<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.739> get<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.010> 54<00:02:59.579> faces<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:01.049> those<00:03:01.230> take

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
boxes to get the 54 faces and those take

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.190 
boxes to get the 54 faces and those take
power<00:03:01.950> from<00:03:02.370> two<00:03:03.269> power<00:03:03.480> supplies<00:03:03.720> there's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
power from two power supplies there's

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.259 
power from two power supplies there's
some<00:03:04.349> redundancy<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.310> take<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.579> signal<00:03:05.940> from

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
some redundancy they take a signal from

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.330 
some redundancy they take a signal from
the<00:03:06.420> microcontroller<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.130> there's<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the microcontroller and then there's a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.509 
the microcontroller and then there's a
custom-built<00:03:09.709> circuit<00:03:10.709> board<00:03:10.920> which<00:03:11.069> marries

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
custom-built circuit board which marries

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.780 
custom-built circuit board which marries
those<00:03:11.760> two<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> actually<00:03:12.560> drive<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.950> LEDs<00:03:14.489> at

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
those two to actually drive the LEDs at

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.090 
those two to actually drive the LEDs at
at<00:03:15.510> full<00:03:15.870> voltage<00:03:16.049> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> signal<00:03:16.890> from<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
at full voltage with the signal from the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.830 
at full voltage with the signal from the
microcontroller<00:03:17.790> you'll<00:03:18.269> notice<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:18.600> there

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
microcontroller you'll notice that there

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.039 
microcontroller you'll notice that there
are<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> lot<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.639> use<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.670> lot<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.880> structure<00:03:21.420> in

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
are a lot of use a lot of structure in

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.840 
are a lot of use a lot of structure in
terms<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.380> trucker<00:03:22.980> straps<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.489> stuff<00:03:23.639> so

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
terms of trucker straps and stuff so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.520 
terms of trucker straps and stuff so
right<00:03:24.359> now<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.690> looks<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:24.989> these<00:03:25.319> are

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
right now it looks like these are

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.210 
right now it looks like these are
diagonal<00:03:26.690> when<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.260> cube<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> lifted<00:03:29.069> it's

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
diagonal when the cube is lifted it's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.979 
diagonal when the cube is lifted it's
actually<00:03:29.519> balanced<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.180> one<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.450> these<00:03:30.540> points

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
actually balanced on one of these points

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.309 
actually balanced on one of these points
and<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.380> these<00:03:32.010> go<00:03:32.579> from<00:03:32.940> being<00:03:33.180> diagonal<00:03:34.139> to

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
and so these go from being diagonal to

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.650 
and so these go from being diagonal to
actually<00:03:34.590> being<00:03:34.709> vertical<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.340> horizontal

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
actually being vertical and horizontal

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.090 
actually being vertical and horizontal
they<00:03:36.660> provide<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> little<00:03:37.290> bit<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.440> tension<00:03:37.709> for

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
they provide a little bit of tension for

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.770 
they provide a little bit of tension for
the<00:03:38.190> structure<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:38.910> mostly<00:03:39.269> what<00:03:39.420> there<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.750> a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the structure but mostly what there is a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.770 
the structure but mostly what there is a
climbing<00:03:40.139> gym<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.859> when<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.209> system<00:03:42.569> is

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
climbing gym so when the system is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.240 
climbing gym so when the system is
actually<00:03:43.079> up<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.470> need<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.709> get<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.130> do

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
actually up if you need to get in to do

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.610 
actually up if you need to get in to do
maintenance<00:03:44.489> there's<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.910> door<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.019> QB

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
maintenance there's a door so that QB

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.110 
maintenance there's a door so that QB
over<00:03:46.799> there<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.069> going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.430> door<00:03:47.760> where

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
over there is going to be a door where

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.879 
over there is going to be a door where
the<00:03:48.150> whole<00:03:48.600> piece<00:03:48.930> will<00:03:49.139> actually<00:03:49.410> rotate<00:03:49.769> out

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
the whole piece will actually rotate out

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.250 
the whole piece will actually rotate out
and<00:03:50.069> somebody<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.489> climb<00:03:50.730> inside<00:03:51.079> I'm<00:03:52.079> not

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
and somebody can climb inside I'm not

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.610 
and somebody can climb inside I'm not
actually<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.709> big<00:03:52.889> into<00:03:53.069> Rubik's<00:03:53.370> cubes<00:03:53.639> I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
actually that big into Rubik's cubes I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.900 
actually that big into Rubik's cubes I
didn't<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.859> play<00:03:56.220> with<00:03:56.370> him<00:03:56.489> much<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
didn't really play with him much as a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.690 
didn't really play with him much as a
kid<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.780> ended<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:58.530> learning<00:03:58.739> how<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.190> solve

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
kid and I ended up learning how to solve

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.390 
kid and I ended up learning how to solve
them<00:04:00.079> while<00:04:01.079> i<00:04:01.109> was<00:04:01.230> doing<00:04:01.349> this<00:04:01.500> project<00:04:01.680> but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
them while i was doing this project but

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680 
them while i was doing this project but
if<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:02.700> gave<00:04:02.849> me<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.150> no<00:04:03.269> i<00:04:03.299> don't<00:04:03.510> think<00:04:03.540> i

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
if you gave me one no i don't think i

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.910 
if you gave me one no i don't think i
could

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
could

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.670 
could
I<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:05.060> like<00:04:05.209> building<00:04:05.540> stuff<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.650> like

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
I just like building stuff you know like

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.470 
I just like building stuff you know like
building<00:04:07.160> arts<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.520> building<00:04:07.940> interesting

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
building arts and building interesting

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.739 
building arts and building interesting
objects<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:09.290> people<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.560> play<00:04:09.709> with
