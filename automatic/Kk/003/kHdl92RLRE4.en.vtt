00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
three people have made are in a grand

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
three people have made are in a grand
day<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.280> better<00:01:38.340> she<00:01:39.180> looks<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.540> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
day so much better she looks so much

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.350 
day so much better she looks so much
more<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:40.259> her<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> sims<00:01:41.009> 3<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.119> think

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that's partially due to um I think

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
that's partially due to um I think
that's<00:01:45.600> partially<00:01:45.869> due<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> custom<00:01:47.250> content
