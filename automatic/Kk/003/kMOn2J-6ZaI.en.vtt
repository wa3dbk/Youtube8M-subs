00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
higher priority and the charging profile

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
higher priority and the charging profile
charging<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> same<00:01:18.090> except<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
charging is about the same except it's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
charging is about the same except it's
at<00:01:19.140> 20%<00:01:19.710> priority<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:20.970> screen<00:01:21.330> off

at 20% priority but the screen off
profile<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> biggest<00:01:23.189> battery

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
profile is really the biggest battery

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
profile is really the biggest battery
saver<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.990> else<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.560> do

please let me know but what I do is when

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.560 
please let me know but what I do is when
the<00:01:31.979> screen<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.340> off<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.090> example<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the screen is off so for example when I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
the screen is off so for example when I
just<00:01:33.750> turn<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> screen<00:01:34.140> off<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
just turn the screen off like this the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.210 
just turn the screen off like this the
processor<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:37.259> under<00:01:37.590> clocks<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
processor really really under clocks and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
processor really really under clocks and
I'll<00:01:38.280> show<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:39.540> under<00:01:39.869> clock<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
I'll show you it's under clock to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'll show you it's under clock to
between<00:01:40.850> 150<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.210> 125<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> 250<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.520> megahertz

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
between 150 or 125 and 250 and megahertz

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
between 150 or 125 and 250 and megahertz
so<00:01:45.780> let's<00:01:45.960> scaled<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.680> down<00:01:46.979> from<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> stock

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so let's scaled way down from the stock

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
so let's scaled way down from the stock
550<00:01:48.360> megahertz<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:50.009> chilling<00:01:50.280> your

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
550 megahertz it's really chilling your

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
550 megahertz it's really chilling your
phone<00:01:50.729> gets<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.270> cool<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:52.020> chills<00:01:52.430> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
phone gets really cool just chills and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
phone gets really cool just chills and
you<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.329> save<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.750> ton<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.110> battery<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you really save a ton of battery that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
you really save a ton of battery that
way<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.700> scaling<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.299> performance

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
way now if scaling is on performance

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
way now if scaling is on performance
mode<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.619> unlock<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> phone<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.729> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mode because I do unlock the phone and I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.480 
mode because I do unlock the phone and I
want<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.390> 250<00:02:01.170> immediately<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.399> your

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
want it to be at 250 immediately so your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
want it to be at 250 immediately so your
phone<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.930> stay<00:02:04.170> chilling

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
phone will really just stay chilling

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700 
phone will really just stay chilling

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
damage to your phone but that's really

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.310 
damage to your phone but that's really
all<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.850> use<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.810> course<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.170> have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
all I use there and of course I have

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.400 
all I use there and of course I have

profiles enabled under advanced I really

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.530 
profiles enabled under advanced I really
haven't<00:02:28.590> changed<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.100> much<00:02:29.310> under<00:02:29.970> sampling

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
haven't changed that much under sampling

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.090 
haven't changed that much under sampling
rate<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.990> don't<00:02:31.200> want<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.560> sample<00:02:31.920> too

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
rate you don't want it to sample too

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.460 
rate you don't want it to sample too
quickly<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.120> will<00:02:33.270> actually<00:02:33.480> begin

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
quickly because that will actually begin

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.920 
quickly because that will actually begin
to<00:02:34.920> take<00:02:35.550> battery<00:02:35.970> power<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.690> sample

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to take battery power so if you sample

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.760 
to take battery power so if you sample
too<00:02:37.800> many<00:02:37.980> times<00:02:38.250> per<00:02:38.520> second<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.510> will

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
too many times per second that will

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.230 
too many times per second that will
start<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.370> we're<00:02:41.820> down<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.060> phone<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
start to you know we're down the phone a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.840 
start to you know we're down the phone a
little<00:02:42.390> bit<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.890> 300,000

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
little bit so I have it at the 300,000

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.120 
little bit so I have it at the 300,000
instead<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> minimum<00:02:45.660> 30,000<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
instead of the minimum 30,000 I have the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.420 
instead of the minimum 30,000 I have the
sub<00:02:47.340> CPU<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.940> threshold<00:02:48.660> 250<00:02:49.110> percent<00:02:49.260> zero<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
sub CPU up threshold 250 percent zero to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
sub CPU up threshold 250 percent zero to
ignore<00:02:50.790> nice<00:02:50.970> load<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.990> power<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
ignore nice load and I have the power to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.710 
ignore nice load and I have the power to
a<00:02:52.410> bias<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:53.130> 820<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.240> gives<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> good

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
a bias to 820 so that gives you a good

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
a bias to 820 so that gives you a good
idea<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.740> battery<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.580> get<00:02:56.760> with

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
idea of how the battery you can get with

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.110 
idea of how the battery you can get with
820<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.050> that's<00:02:58.830> about<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.460> for<00:02:59.670> how<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.820> use

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
820 and that's about it for how I use

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.270 
820 and that's about it for how I use
set<00:03:00.330> CPU<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.080> hopefully<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.620> gives<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
set CPU so hopefully this gives you a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.070 
set CPU so hopefully this gives you a
better<00:03:02.640> idea<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:03.090> how<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> best

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
better idea of how you can get the best

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.510 
better idea of how you can get the best
battery<00:03:04.350> life<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.920> your<00:03:05.040> phone<00:03:05.190> while

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
battery life out of your phone while

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.710 
battery life out of your phone while
still<00:03:05.790> getting<00:03:06.000> some<00:03:06.180> pretty<00:03:06.540> awesome

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
still getting some pretty awesome

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900 
still getting some pretty awesome
performance<00:03:07.530> out<00:03:07.710> of<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.130> don't<00:03:08.520> actually

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
performance out of it I don't actually

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.090 
performance out of it I don't actually
use<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.300> some<00:03:09.510> CPU<00:03:09.810> widget<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.890> use

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
use this some CPU widget but you can use

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.010 
use this some CPU widget but you can use
that<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.460> get<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> good<00:03:11.760> idea<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.120> monitoring

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
that to get a good idea of monitoring

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.470 
that to get a good idea of monitoring
your<00:03:13.200> temperatures<00:03:13.680> but<00:03:14.100> overall<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.850> really

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
your temperatures but overall I really

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.910 
your temperatures but overall I really
love<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.750> application<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.620> helped<00:03:16.800> me

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
love this application and it's helped me

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.980 
love this application and it's helped me
save<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> lot<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.400> battery<00:03:17.790> life<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.780> my

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
save a lot of battery life and have my
