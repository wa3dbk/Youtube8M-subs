weakest<00:05:13.190> shit<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:14.090> commando<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.720> good<00:05:14.960> gun

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
weakest shit the commando is a good gun

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.990 
weakest shit the commando is a good gun
is<00:05:15.380> nice<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.770> strong<00:05:16.009> but<00:05:16.280> it's<00:05:16.460> slower<00:05:16.789> than

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
is nice and strong but it's slower than

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.520 
is nice and strong but it's slower than
the<00:05:17.060> famas<00:05:17.449> that's<00:05:17.750> what<00:05:17.900> makes<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.229> not<00:05:18.349> as

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
the famas that's what makes it not as

the famas that's what makes it not as
usable<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:20.120> AAG<00:05:20.560> I'm<00:05:21.560> like<00:05:22.099> I'm<00:05:22.310> thinking

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
usable and the AAG I'm like I'm thinking

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.640 
usable and the AAG I'm like I'm thinking
that<00:05:22.849> this<00:05:23.030> is<00:05:23.210> what<00:05:23.360> I'm<00:05:23.449> thinking<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:23.990> MLG

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
that this is what I'm thinking like MLG

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.689 
that this is what I'm thinking like MLG
players<00:05:24.860> are<00:05:25.009> going<00:05:25.099> to<00:05:25.160> automatically

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
either hop on the ark and if not that

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.350 
either hop on the ark and if not that
then<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.520> commando<00:05:28.940> is<00:05:29.000> going<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.210> be<00:05:29.270> the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
then the commando is going to be the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.149 
then the commando is going to be the
next<00:05:29.510> option<00:05:29.780> but<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.199> OGG<00:05:30.349> is<00:05:30.680> not<00:05:30.889> getting

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
most the strongest gun just just because

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.240 
most the strongest gun just just because
we<00:06:25.159> know<00:06:25.250> just<00:06:25.520> picking<00:06:26.090> a<00:06:26.330> random<00:06:26.509> gun<00:06:26.900> and

we know just picking a random gun and

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.860 
we know just picking a random gun and
making<00:06:28.250> it<00:06:28.340> stronger<00:06:28.610> this<00:06:28.820> then<00:06:29.360> make<00:06:29.750> it

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
making it stronger this then make it

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.689 
making it stronger this then make it
seem<00:06:30.139> like<00:06:30.169> it's<00:06:30.590> stronger<00:06:30.860> than<00:06:30.889> the<00:06:31.370> famas

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
seem like it's stronger than the famas

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.029 
seem like it's stronger than the famas
and<00:06:32.000> be<00:06:32.659> fine<00:06:32.930> like<00:06:33.169> that<00:06:33.380> but<00:06:33.620> I'm<00:06:33.710> tired<00:06:33.919> of
