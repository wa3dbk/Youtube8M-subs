00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
front now this is gonna be kind of a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.400 
front now this is gonna be kind of a
hard<00:02:18.120> part<00:02:18.390> I've<00:02:18.660> never<00:02:18.930> done<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.350> before

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hard part I've never done this before

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.640 
hard part I've never done this before
but<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.040> haven't<00:02:20.490> my<00:02:20.640> mind<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.560> hopefully<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
but I haven't my mind so hopefully it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.830 
but I haven't my mind so hopefully it
turns<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.820> zigzag<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
turns out I'm just going to zigzag the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.040 
turns out I'm just going to zigzag the
string<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.890> forth<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.540> triangle

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
string back and forth on the triangle

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.130 
string back and forth on the triangle
piece<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.530> our<00:02:28.680> top<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> looks<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:30.140> she's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
piece of our top so it looks like she's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.310 
piece of our top so it looks like she's
wearing<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.500> corset<00:02:32.630> kind<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.750> hard<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.050> do

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
wearing a corset kind of hard to do

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720 
wearing a corset kind of hard to do
one-handed<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.190> I'm<00:02:35.280> holding<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730

one-handed to because I'm holding the
Barbie<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.330> doing<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.019> one<00:02:37.200> hand

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
Barbie and then doing this with one hand

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.220 
Barbie and then doing this with one hand
so<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.580> press<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.610> fold<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:43.019> back

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
so just press it and fold it and go back

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.530 
so just press it and fold it and go back
and<00:02:43.470> forth

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 

okay<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.650> did<00:02:50.830> one<00:02:51.010> side<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.400> ribbon<00:02:51.909> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
okay we did one side of the ribbon and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.789 
okay we did one side of the ribbon and
then<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.299> have<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.599> do<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> other<00:02:53.049> side<00:02:53.439> I

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
then we have to do the other side I

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.179 
then we have to do the other side I
rolled<00:02:54.519> out<00:02:54.640> my<00:02:54.849> hands<00:02:55.180> another<00:02:55.540> string<00:02:56.189> and

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
rolled out my hands another string and

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.100 
rolled out my hands another string and
we'll<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.579> connect<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.269> same<00:02:58.480> way<00:02:58.720> just

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
we'll just connect it the same way just

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.780 
we'll just connect it the same way just
starting<00:02:59.530> at<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> top<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.310> then<00:03:00.459> going<00:03:00.760> back

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
starting at the top and then going back

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.339 
starting at the top and then going back
and<00:03:01.269> forth<00:03:01.659> all<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.319> way<00:03:02.620> down<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.159> bottom

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
and forth all the way down to the bottom

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.140 
and forth all the way down to the bottom
I'm<00:03:05.349> just<00:03:05.650> Criss<00:03:05.920> crossing<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.849> then

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
I'm just Criss crossing it and then

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.390 
I'm just Criss crossing it and then
making<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.629> faults<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.290> between<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.069> string

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
making the faults in between the string

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
making the faults in between the string
that<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.579> just<00:03:09.879> did<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.909> little<00:03:13.209> bit<00:03:13.360> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
that I just did and have a little bit of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.819 
that I just did and have a little bit of
extra<00:03:13.629> play-doh<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.079> I'm<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.650> wrap

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
extra play-doh so I'm just going to wrap

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.440 
extra play-doh so I'm just going to wrap
it<00:03:14.860> around<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.459> connect<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> first

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
it around and connect it to the first

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.800 
it around and connect it to the first
string<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.879> here's<00:03:18.879> a<00:03:19.000> better<00:03:19.150> look<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.629> her

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
string and here's a better look at her

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.360 
string and here's a better look at her
corset<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.560> actually<00:03:20.829> turned<00:03:21.310> out<00:03:21.430> really<00:03:21.489> well

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
corset I actually turned out really well

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.860 
corset I actually turned out really well
next<00:03:24.370> I'm<00:03:24.489> going<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.790> use<00:03:24.970> play-doh<00:03:25.269> Plus<00:03:25.540> to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
next I'm going to use play-doh Plus to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.740 
next I'm going to use play-doh Plus to
make<00:03:26.019> Rapunzel's<00:03:26.680> Barbie<00:03:27.040> sleeves<00:03:27.750> now

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
make Rapunzel's Barbie sleeves now

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.170 
make Rapunzel's Barbie sleeves now
play-doh<00:03:29.200> Plus<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:29.650> much<00:03:29.859> easier<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> extrude

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
play-doh Plus is much easier to extrude

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.530 
play-doh Plus is much easier to extrude
and<00:03:31.569> mold<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.430> model<00:03:33.430> than<00:03:33.909> regular<00:03:34.120> play-doh

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and mold and model than regular play-doh

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.660 
and mold and model than regular play-doh
so<00:03:35.200> I'm<00:03:35.349> gonna<00:03:35.560> use<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.950> my<00:03:36.099> advantage

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
so I'm gonna use that to my advantage

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.610 
so I'm gonna use that to my advantage
what<00:03:37.269> I'm<00:03:37.329> doing<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.810> just<00:03:37.870> pressing<00:03:38.409> it<00:03:38.530> up

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
what I'm doing is just pressing it up

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.800 
what I'm doing is just pressing it up
the<00:03:39.310> play-doh<00:03:39.519> extruder<00:03:39.639> but<00:03:40.450> I'm<00:03:40.540> kind<00:03:40.750> of

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the play-doh extruder but I'm kind of

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.619 
the play-doh extruder but I'm kind of
pressing<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.290> into<00:03:41.500> her<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.030> what<00:03:43.180> makes<00:03:43.389> a

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
pressing it into her and so what makes a

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.890 
pressing it into her and so what makes a
little<00:03:43.780> folding<00:03:44.290> pattern<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:46.450> sticky

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
little folding pattern and it's sticky

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.180 
little folding pattern and it's sticky
