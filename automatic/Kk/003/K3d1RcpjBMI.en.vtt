okay<00:01:44.550> there<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.790> couple<00:01:44.910> techniques<00:01:45.330> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
okay there are a couple techniques that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390 
okay there are a couple techniques that
we're<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.050> over<00:01:46.080> here<00:01:46.620> briefly

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
we're going to go over here briefly

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.640 
we're going to go over here briefly
before<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.060> start<00:01:48.480> getting<00:01:48.990> into<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.320> lead<00:01:49.440> to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
before we start getting into the lead to

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
before we start getting into the lead to
much<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.640> first<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.360> rake<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.440> do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
much the first is a rake I do a lot of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.900 
much the first is a rake I do a lot of
rakes<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.470> song<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.700> first

on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.180> D<00:02:03.900> note<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:06.210> you're<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
on the D note and then you're going to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.780 
on the D note and then you're going to
create<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:07.860> rake<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> five<00:02:08.460> cord

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
create you're going to rake a five cord

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.050 
create you're going to rake a five cord
basically<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.510> to<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.979> high<00:02:11.130> D<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.940> B

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
basically up to the high D on the B

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.620 
basically up to the high D on the B
string<00:02:13.340> rake<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.580> sort<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.480> sweet

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
string rake is sort of like sweet

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.360 
string rake is sort of like sweet
picking<00:02:16.020> except<00:02:16.350> for<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.740> goal<00:02:16.920> isn't<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
picking except for your goal isn't to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.150 
picking except for your goal isn't to
necessarily<00:02:18.330> keep<00:02:18.570> time<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.290> more<00:02:19.530> grace

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
necessarily keep time it's more grace

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.020 
necessarily keep time it's more grace
notes<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:21.360> you're<00:02:21.750> targeting<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.530> certain<00:02:22.830> note

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
notes as you're targeting a certain note

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.890 
notes as you're targeting a certain note
so<00:02:24.030> I'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.270> play<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> beginning<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
so I'm going to play the beginning of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.780 
so I'm going to play the beginning of
the<00:02:24.960> solo<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.710> show<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.190> how<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.370> rake

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the solo here and show you how that rake

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:40.960 
the solo here and show you how that rake
is<00:02:27.090> applied<00:02:33.950> look<00:02:34.950> at<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:35.310> time

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.150 

okay<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:42.720> there's<00:02:42.930> another<00:02:43.050> rake<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
okay then there's another rake that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.180 
okay then there's another rake that
happens<00:02:44.550> over<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> diminished<00:02:45.600> triad<00:02:46.190> we're

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
happens over a diminished triad we're

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
happens over a diminished triad we're
going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> head<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.700> down<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
going to head back down here to the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:59.770 
going to head back down here to the
b-flat<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:54.060> they'll<00:02:54.180> sound<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.480> this

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.990 

yeah<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.900> more<00:03:00.989> time

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.480 

okay<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.230> those<00:03:09.350> are<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> rakes<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:10.070> am

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
okay so those are the rakes I am

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.050 
okay so those are the rakes I am
basically<00:03:10.820> playing<00:03:11.210> right<00:03:11.450> now<00:03:11.480> out<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.290> a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
basically playing right now out of a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.690 
basically playing right now out of a
natural<00:03:14.060> harmonic<00:03:14.690> minor<00:03:15.380> scale<00:03:15.860> in<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.550> key

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
natural harmonic minor scale in the key

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.300 
natural harmonic minor scale in the key
of<00:03:16.730> D<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.230> position<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.980> can<00:03:19.100> look<00:03:19.220> in

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
of D and the position you can look in

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.190 
of D and the position you can look in
the<00:03:19.370> reference<00:03:19.640> material<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.660> position<00:03:21.080> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
the reference material the position I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.120 
the reference material the position I
intentionally<00:03:21.800> left<00:03:22.340> out<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.730> high<00:03:22.880> E<00:03:22.910> string

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
intentionally left out the high E string

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.200 
intentionally left out the high E string
for<00:03:25.130> most<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.550> this<00:03:25.670> stuff<00:03:25.910> at<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.090> beginning

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
for most of this stuff at the beginning

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.180 
for most of this stuff at the beginning
because<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.810> like<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.230> freedom<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.800> able<00:03:27.890> to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
because I like the freedom to be able to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.370 
because I like the freedom to be able to
nail<00:03:29.000> those<00:03:29.210> vibrato<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.780> little<00:03:30.080> bit<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:30.350> you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
nail those vibrato a little bit if you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.170 
nail those vibrato a little bit if you
were<00:03:30.530> doing<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.920> on<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.070> east<00:03:31.370> ring<00:03:31.640> you'd

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
were doing that on your east ring you'd

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.540 
were doing that on your east ring you'd
be<00:03:32.360> pulling<00:03:33.050> off<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.980> edge<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.340> neck

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
be pulling off the the edge of the neck

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:44.880 
be pulling off the the edge of the neck
so<00:03:34.940> let's<00:03:35.840> look<00:03:35.990> at<00:03:36.170> at<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.740> scale<00:03:37.070> now

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:53.540 

ending

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.850 

so<00:03:54.550> this<00:03:54.730> first<00:03:54.880> part<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.360> staying<00:03:56.350> mainly<00:03:56.770> in

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
so this first part is staying mainly in

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.740 
so this first part is staying mainly in
the<00:03:56.950> natural<00:03:57.340> minor<00:03:57.550> if<00:03:57.820> we<00:03:58.210> look<00:03:58.420> at<00:03:58.600> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the natural minor if we look at the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.240 
the natural minor if we look at the
beginning<00:03:59.140> riff<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.560> most<00:04:05.740> part<00:04:05.980> other

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
beginning riff for the most part other

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.370 
beginning riff for the most part other
than<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.490> diminished<00:04:06.820> triad<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:08.140> are

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
than that diminished triad we are

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.160 
than that diminished triad we are
staying<00:04:09.130> in<00:04:09.540> natural<00:04:10.540> minor<00:04:10.720> we're<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.050> kind

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
staying in natural minor we're just kind

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.650 
staying in natural minor we're just kind
of<00:04:11.200> walking<00:04:11.620> down<00:04:11.770> descending<00:04:12.550> in<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.510> D

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
of walking down descending in the D

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.880 
of walking down descending in the D
natural<00:04:14.260> minor<00:04:14.410> scale<00:04:19.799> essentially<00:04:20.799> that's

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
natural minor scale essentially that's

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.930 
natural minor scale essentially that's
what<00:04:21.010> I'm<00:04:21.100> doing<00:04:21.280> just<00:04:21.459> adding<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.760> little<00:04:21.790> bit

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
what I'm doing just adding a little bit

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.220 
what I'm doing just adding a little bit
more<00:04:22.030> flavor<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.660> I'm<00:04:22.930> gonna<00:04:23.020> play<00:04:23.200> that

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
more flavor so I'm gonna play that

okay<00:05:28.440> after<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.520> we've<00:05:29.790> got<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:30.030> unison<00:05:30.690> bin

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
okay after that we've got a unison bin

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:42.440 
okay after that we've got a unison bin
and<00:05:33.139> then<00:05:39.320> now<00:05:40.320> at<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.590> point<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:41.270> switch<00:05:42.270> my

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
and then now at this point I switch my

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.629 
and then now at this point I switch my
pickup<00:05:42.810> configuration<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:44.010> my<00:05:44.160> neck<00:05:44.370> pickup

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
pickup configuration to my neck pickup

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.850 
pickup configuration to my neck pickup
because<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.750> next<00:05:45.960> rake<00:05:46.139> that's<00:05:46.320> coming<00:05:46.590> up<00:05:46.740> I

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
because the next rake that's coming up I

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.270 
because the next rake that's coming up I
thought<00:05:47.040> sounded<00:05:47.250> cooler<00:05:47.730> on<00:05:47.940> this<00:05:48.750> pickup

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
thought sounded cooler on this pickup

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.580 
thought sounded cooler on this pickup
alright<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.460> this<00:05:50.610> this<00:05:51.030> next<00:05:51.300> rake<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.900> going

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
alright so this this next rake is going

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.690 
alright so this this next rake is going
to<00:05:52.650> be<00:05:52.770> done<00:05:53.600> over<00:05:54.600> a<00:05:54.630> C<00:05:55.020> major<00:05:55.650> arpeggio<00:05:56.460> and

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
this C major arpeggio is going to be

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.090 
this C major arpeggio is going to be
played<00:05:59.010> over<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.520> D<00:05:59.880> minor<00:06:00.270> groove<00:06:00.950> how<00:06:01.950> does

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:54.910 

one<00:06:45.950> more<00:06:46.070> time<00:06:52.030> now<00:06:53.030> over<00:06:53.540> the<00:06:53.870> D<00:06:54.020> chord<00:06:54.320> we're

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
one more time now over the D chord we're

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.290 
one more time now over the D chord we're
going<00:06:54.950> to<00:06:55.100> just<00:06:55.310> do<00:06:55.400> it<00:06:55.430> real<00:06:55.670> fast<00:06:55.880> this<00:06:56.180> is<00:06:56.270> a

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
going to just do it real fast this is a

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.350 
going to just do it real fast this is a
little<00:06:56.600> bit<00:06:56.720> slower<00:06:57.080> than<00:06:58.030> some<00:06:59.030> of<00:06:59.180> the<00:06:59.240> other

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
little bit slower than some of the other

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.700 
little bit slower than some of the other
ones<00:06:59.540> we've<00:06:59.690> done<00:06:59.870> a<00:06:59.900> little<00:07:00.080> bit<00:07:00.260> less<00:07:00.410> grace

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
ones we've done a little bit less grace

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.980 
ones we've done a little bit less grace
notes<00:07:01.010> and<00:07:01.250> you're<00:07:01.340> actually<00:07:01.490> a<00:07:01.940> little<00:07:02.900> bit

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
notes and you're actually a little bit

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.360 
notes and you're actually a little bit
more<00:07:03.140> of<00:07:03.200> like<00:07:03.320> a<00:07:03.350> sweet<00:07:03.650> picking<00:07:03.950> exercise

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
more of like a sweet picking exercise

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.280 
more of like a sweet picking exercise
here<00:07:04.640> so<00:07:05.420> that's<00:07:05.570> going<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.750> sound<00:07:05.960> like<00:07:06.080> this

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
here so that's going to sound like this

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:21.870 
here so that's going to sound like this
closed<00:07:06.830> up<00:07:06.950> to<00:07:07.070> tempo

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.940
