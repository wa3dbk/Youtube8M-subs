00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
me basically three choices at this point

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
me basically three choices at this point
I<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.509> decide<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.989> play<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
I can decide to play it just like a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.570 
I can decide to play it just like a
normal<00:02:10.890> DVD

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
normal DVD

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000

between<00:02:15.090> 10<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.630> 40<00:02:15.990> minutes<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.380> depends<00:02:16.710> on

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
between 10 and 40 minutes it depends on

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.280 
between 10 and 40 minutes it depends on
your<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.220> DVD<00:02:17.550> Drive<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.000> PC<00:02:18.300> or<00:02:19.080> we've

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
your your DVD Drive and your PC or we've

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
your your DVD Drive and your PC or we've
introduced<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.920> innovative<00:02:20.190> feature<00:02:20.460> which

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
introduced this innovative feature which

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
introduced this innovative feature which
allows<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.180> plane<00:02:21.540> save<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> same

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
allows you to plane save it at the same

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.810 
allows you to plane save it at the same
time<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.340> innovative

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
time we think this is really innovative

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.980 
time we think this is really innovative
because<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.180> haven't<00:02:24.330> seen<00:02:24.510> any<00:02:24.690> product<00:02:24.960> that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
because we haven't seen any product that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.050 
because we haven't seen any product that
allows<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.470> actually<00:02:25.710> play<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> DVD<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
allows you to actually play a DVD and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.250 
allows you to actually play a DVD and
save<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> same<00:02:27.600> time<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.020> you're<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

rush and you want to start watching it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.950 
rush and you want to start watching it
while<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:29.820> saving<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.210> they<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
while you're saving it they can do that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.840 
while you're saving it they can do that
and<00:02:31.380> I'll<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.010> I'll<00:02:32.160> start<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.490> process<00:02:32.640> up

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and I'll just I'll start that process up

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.580 
and I'll just I'll start that process up
here<00:02:33.000> once<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> drive<00:02:33.450> spins<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.170> how<00:02:34.440> is
