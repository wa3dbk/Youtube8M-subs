and here's how that sounds you've heard
that<00:02:06.490> before<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> really<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.679> blend<00:02:08.920> major

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
that before so really we can blend major

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.949 
that before so really we can blend major
pentatonic<00:02:09.580> scale<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.330> minor<00:02:10.569> pentatonic

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
pentatonic scale and minor pentatonic

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.259 
pentatonic scale and minor pentatonic
scale<00:02:11.500> over<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:12.099> dominant<00:02:12.730> chord<00:02:12.880> what<00:02:13.239> I

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
scale over a dominant chord what I

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.350 
scale over a dominant chord what I
wanted<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.900> show<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> today<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.680> how<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:16.150> can

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
wanted to show you today is how we can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.009 
wanted to show you today is how we can
play<00:02:16.540> modal<00:02:17.049> modes<00:02:17.910> within<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.360> dominant

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
play modal modes within this dominant

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.319 
play modal modes within this dominant
context<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.739> it's<00:02:20.980> really<00:02:21.250> easy<00:02:21.400> let's<00:02:22.120> take

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
context and it's really easy let's take

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.480 
context and it's really easy let's take
a<00:02:22.359> minor<00:02:22.720> pentatonic<00:02:23.560> scale

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.820 

we're<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.240> G<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:29.690> G<00:02:29.720> minor<00:02:30.080> pentatonic<00:02:30.410> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
we're in G so G minor pentatonic and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.940 
we're in G so G minor pentatonic and
then<00:02:31.400> let's<00:02:31.960> now<00:02:32.960> look<00:02:33.410> at<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.680> major

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
then let's now look at a major

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.720 
then let's now look at a major
pentatonic<00:02:34.340> scale<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.940> G<00:02:39.160> let's<00:02:40.160> now<00:02:40.310> blend

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
pentatonic scale in G let's now blend

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.760 
pentatonic scale in G let's now blend
both<00:02:41.090> scales<00:02:41.540> together<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.530> we're<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.710> to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
both scales together so we're going to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.000 
both scales together so we're going to
have<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.720> weird-looking<00:02:44.720> shape<00:02:45.230> we're<00:02:45.620> looking

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
have a weird-looking shape we're looking

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.860 
have a weird-looking shape we're looking
scale<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.120> made<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> minor

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
scale that is made of the minor

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.510 
scale that is made of the minor
pentatonic<00:02:48.230> scale<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.920> major<00:02:49.130> pentatonic

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
pentatonic scale and a major pentatonic

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.250 
pentatonic scale and a major pentatonic
scale<00:02:50.830> confusing<00:02:51.830> right<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:53.330> if<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.110> know

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
scale confusing right but if you know

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.400 
scale confusing right but if you know
your<00:02:54.440> modes<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.790> find<00:02:56.300> 2<00:02:56.750> Headed<00:02:57.200> modes

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
your modes we can find 2 Headed modes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.970 
your modes we can find 2 Headed modes
within<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.570> blend<00:02:59.570> of<00:02:59.840> pentatonic<00:03:00.710> scales

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
within that blend of pentatonic scales

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.200 
within that blend of pentatonic scales
you<00:03:01.910> find<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.390> mixolydian<00:03:02.840> mode<00:03:03.070> that's

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
you find the mixolydian mode that's

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.790 
you find the mixolydian mode that's
great<00:03:05.210> because<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.930> mixolydian<00:03:06.200> mode<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.710> a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
great because the mixolydian mode is a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.300 
great because the mixolydian mode is a
dominant<00:03:07.250> mode<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.790> has<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> major<00:03:08.270> third<00:03:08.570> minor

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
dominant mode it has a major third minor

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.140 
dominant mode it has a major third minor
7<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.990> that's<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.860> know<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:16.520> know<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.910> we

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
7 and that's you know we know that we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.360 
7 and that's you know we know that we
should<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.570> that's<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.050> we<00:03:18.200> also<00:03:18.350> find<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
should know that's but we also find the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.180 
should know that's but we also find the
Dorian<00:03:19.760> mode<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:21.020> Dorian<00:03:21.380> mode<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.800> not<00:03:22.160> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
Dorian mode the Dorian mode is not a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.820 
Dorian mode the Dorian mode is not a
dominant<00:03:22.760> mode<00:03:22.940> but<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.660> has<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.870> minor<00:03:24.200> 3rd<00:03:24.560> and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
dominant mode but it has a minor 3rd and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.620 
dominant mode but it has a minor 3rd and
we<00:03:25.010> know<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.520> play<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.760> minor<00:03:26.060> 3rd<00:03:26.360> over<00:03:26.600> a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
we know we can play a minor 3rd over a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.140 
we know we can play a minor 3rd over a
major<00:03:26.870> 3rd<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.470> blues<00:03:28.070> context<00:03:28.700> that's<00:03:28.970> what

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
major 3rd and blues context that's what

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.200 
major 3rd and blues context that's what
gives<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.750> flavor<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.410> blues<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.460> what

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
gives it the flavor of the blues so what

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.610 
gives it the flavor of the blues so what
did<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.360> mean<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.810> means<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.230> next<00:03:33.500> time
