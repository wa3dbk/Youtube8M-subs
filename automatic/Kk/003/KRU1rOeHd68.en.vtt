treatment<00:01:37.149> to<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.539> when<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.750> was<00:01:37.899> bribing<00:01:38.470> up<00:01:38.740> a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
treatment to get when I was bribing up a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.399 
treatment to get when I was bribing up a
bit<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.039> a<00:01:39.159> lift<00:01:39.539> somehow<00:01:40.539> there<00:01:40.720> are<00:01:40.750> benefits

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
bit of a lift somehow there are benefits

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.930 
bit of a lift somehow there are benefits
I<00:01:41.470> usually<00:01:41.619> go<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> little<00:01:42.100> bit<00:01:42.310> longer<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:42.729> I'm

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
I usually go a little bit longer so I'm

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.309 
I usually go a little bit longer so I'm
going<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.210> go<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> little<00:01:43.450> further<00:01:43.690> than<00:01:43.929> 30

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
going to go a little further than 30

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.010 
going to go a little further than 30
seconds<00:01:44.800> but<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.729> does<00:01:45.970> time<00:01:46.390> itself<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
seconds but it does time itself and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.840 
seconds but it does time itself and
after<00:01:47.200> every<00:01:47.470> 30<00:01:47.710> seconds<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.340> will<00:01:48.490> turn<00:01:48.700> on

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
after every 30 seconds it will turn on

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.050 
after every 30 seconds it will turn on
so<00:01:49.450> will<00:01:49.630> be<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.020> turning<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.440> right<00:01:50.560> back<00:01:50.740> on

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so will be just turning it right back on

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.249 
so will be just turning it right back on
now<00:01:52.060> if<00:01:52.179> you<00:01:52.270> notice<00:01:52.569> they<00:01:52.720> will<00:01:52.899> start

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
now if you notice they will start

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.410 
now if you notice they will start
usually<00:01:53.740> with<00:01:53.979> lifting<00:01:54.429> on<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.819> tail<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.300> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
usually with lifting on the tail of the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.779 
usually with lifting on the tail of the
brow<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.050> midpoint<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.340> when<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.550> get

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
brow and the midpoint that so when I get

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.669 
brow and the midpoint that so when I get
up<00:01:57.909> on<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.509> area<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.929> now<00:01:59.200> I'm<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.530> your

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
up on to that area and now I'm on your

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.010 
up on to that area and now I'm on your
brow<00:01:59.860> bone<00:02:00.069> I<00:02:00.340> tend<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.270> start<00:02:01.509> out<00:02:01.720> here<00:02:01.869> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
brow bone I tend to start out here in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.680 
brow bone I tend to start out here in
the<00:02:02.110> temple<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.280> apply<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.640> pretty<00:02:03.970> good-sized

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the temple and apply a pretty good-sized

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.570 
the temple and apply a pretty good-sized
pressure<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:06.009> make<00:02:06.190> sure<00:02:06.369> you're<00:02:06.520> not

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
pressure just make sure you're not

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.430 
pressure just make sure you're not
dragging<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.209> skin<00:02:07.509> right<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:08.319> it's

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
dragging the skin right and then it's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.990 
dragging the skin right and then it's
always<00:02:08.619> gliding<00:02:11.280> how's<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.400> feeling<00:02:12.670> just

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
always gliding how's that feeling just

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.809 
always gliding how's that feeling just
good

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.360 

that<00:02:16.390> word<00:02:16.629> your<00:02:17.019> cerumen<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:18.219> not

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.880 
that word your cerumen it's not
irritating<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.269> but<00:02:19.659> it's<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:20.620> light

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
irritating it's but it's not light

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.300 
irritating it's but it's not light
ticklish<00:02:21.750> good<00:02:22.750> point<00:02:23.469> you<00:02:23.560> comfortable

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
ticklish good point you comfortable

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.099 
ticklish good point you comfortable
it<00:02:24.579> does<00:02:24.730> feel<00:02:24.939> fantastic<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.719> you're<00:02:25.870> doing

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
it does feel fantastic if you're doing

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.199 
it does feel fantastic if you're doing
this<00:02:26.200> yourself

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.640 

so<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.689> always<00:02:30.870> want<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.170> make<00:02:31.319> sure<00:02:31.500> it's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so you always want to make sure it's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.319 
so you always want to make sure it's
always<00:02:31.829> gliding<00:02:32.400> there's<00:02:32.700> our<00:02:32.849> first<00:02:33.030> 30

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
always gliding there's our first 30

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.020 
always gliding there's our first 30
seconds<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:35.040> fact<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.489> find<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.909> it

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
seconds if in fact you find that it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.179 
seconds if in fact you find that it
stops<00:02:36.359> gliding<00:02:36.959> your<00:02:37.290> serums<00:02:37.650> may<00:02:37.859> be<00:02:37.920> either

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
stops gliding your serums may be either

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.280 
stops gliding your serums may be either
penetrated<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.239> or<00:02:39.569> it's<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.260> done

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
penetrated in or it's time to be done

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
penetrated in or it's time to be done
with<00:02:40.469> your<00:02:40.769> treatment<00:02:41.150> what<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> usually<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.689> is

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
with your treatment what I usually do is

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.690
