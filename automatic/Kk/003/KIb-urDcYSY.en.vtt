00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
have just stuck to the numbers good but

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.810 
have just stuck to the numbers good but
Britt<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.080> saw<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.590> gave<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.190> nothing

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
are the only difference is it's been

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.320 
are the only difference is it's been
supercharged<00:01:30.050> so<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.380> produces<00:01:30.940> 542<00:01:31.940> brake
