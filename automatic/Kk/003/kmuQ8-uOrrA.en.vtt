00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
twist this like how it was before and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.350 
twist this like how it was before and
just<00:01:57.290> flip<00:01:57.620> it<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:01.610> how<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.910> straight<00:02:02.120> you

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
just flip it see how it's straight you

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.300 
just flip it see how it's straight you
just<00:02:02.390> flip<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.070> beads

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
just flip it and then you have the beads

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.570 
just flip it and then you have the beads
come<00:02:07.790> through<00:02:08.710> like<00:02:09.710> this

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.720 

I<00:02:15.610> mean<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.660> um<00:02:17.410> always<00:02:18.250> wrap<00:02:18.490> this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
I mean you can um always wrap this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.190 
I mean you can um always wrap this
around<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.400> can't<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.930> hair

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
around so that you can't see the hair

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.070 
around so that you can't see the hair
poking<00:02:26.530> out<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.240> then<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.540> how<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> be<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
poking out and then this is how to be to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.320 
poking out and then this is how to be to
look
