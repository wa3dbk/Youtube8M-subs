00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello my dear friends with you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.639
 crazy ted and welcome to new 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 part of mine craft mechanisms in general then i 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.420
 left here for a while how to say 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 briefly for a month generally change how 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.550
 so it happened but in any case 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 Now I am ready to show you this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 fucking mechanism 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 he is as always ultracompact in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.770
 In general, everything as you like to 3 by 2 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.399
 block everything takes red wool again 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.370
 do we have it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.130
 prolongs the mechanism looks it all here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 so here it is closed and 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.030
 opened that is this mechanism 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.190
 naturally as u understood from the club 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.300
 mechanical yes where was the gate then 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.860
 there is an internal parking that is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 here and so this mechanism looks 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 in general it is simply unreal pity now 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.300
 we will build in just a couple of seconds so 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.699
 that everyone get ready let's start now 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.760
 We put so accordingly pine 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.320
 four blocks in there so 2 repeater on 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.229
 maximum delay here a piece 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 redstone here in this way set 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.050
 2 blocks and then the floor block here we need 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.369
 insert a red torch here another block 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.300
 another lot of the day boiler fill it 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.350
 water remove the block set here 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.540
 the comporator is here a piece of redstone and here 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.820
 Now we have already held the red 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.560
 great now here is a repeater 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.200
 two clicks of the delay here a piece 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 arrested everyone now starting by 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.759
 order here is the usual piston here we are 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.479
 We put here in this way 3 sticky pistons 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.970
 and here we can already put semi-blocks 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.990
 either the glass is important for it to be 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.270
 a blog that doesn't try to signal now 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.369
 still so the whole thing set that is two 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 boiler you get over them here 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 such half blocks 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 Now we are doing even further construction here. 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.900
 Again, we should have several 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.010
 blocks 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:19.760
 here a half block follower 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.569
 comparator a piece of redstone and of course 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.400
 same red torch 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.380
 all you can now put the sand just 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.790
 So 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:38.230
 and blocks blocks this here we close up like u 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 we will be such a wall here we put 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.460
 so two blocks here we will already have 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.800
 fence fence set here and over it yet 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 block now you can immediately put more 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.190
 sticky pistons that will be so 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.370
 Venish is directed yes fine so now 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:05.740
 now we put a red block here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.430
 the torch lever set here immediately in 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.510
 activate here the repeater unit without 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.410
 delay block on red torch sticky 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 piston 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 only so he down was given so here 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:26.260
 respectively blog 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:31.200
 red block repeater here and normal 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.069
 piston put it in here like this all 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.010
 further put here god red torch 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.860
 block two more blocks here here a piece 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.599
 redstone here is a follower delay 2 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.050
 click here repeater is delayed by one 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.060
 click and basically it should be all 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.130
 let's check our mechanism don't hope 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.930
 that will work very hard now 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:00.269
 I hope so click on the lever here with us 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.069
 the mechanism closed and put on the lever he 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.349
 opened that is, as you understand further 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.660
 all you have to do to 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.180
 increase the mechanism here just let's say 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.060
 a piece of redstone repeater but also 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.650
 all this is put here you have a situation 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.019
 not really changing something you just have to 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.639
 also put the blocks here 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.740
 put the floor block like this and that is 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.440
 pave so simple and stand 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.360
 repeaters basically that's all mine 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 Dear friends, thank you so much for 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.300
 watching with you was crazycat
