00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
things from be ravine once they go over

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.240 
things from be ravine once they go over
to<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> midpoint<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:12.410> can<00:02:12.560> easily<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:12.980> jump

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to a midpoint we can easily just jump

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.100 
to a midpoint we can easily just jump
whoa<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.510> was<00:02:14.840> weird<00:02:16.090> weird<00:02:17.090> camera<00:02:17.360> angle<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
whoa I was weird weird camera angle the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.420 
whoa I was weird weird camera angle the
slowest<00:02:18.470> part<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.830> little<00:02:19.010> heart<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.280> that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
slowest part of a little heart is that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.890 
slowest part of a little heart is that
part<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.000> pretty<00:02:20.360> much<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.660> rest<00:02:20.780> of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
part and then pretty much the rest of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.920 
part and then pretty much the rest of
the<00:02:20.990> levels<00:02:21.290> very<00:02:21.860> easy<00:02:22.180> um<00:02:23.180> once<00:02:23.630> you've

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the levels very easy um once you've

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.590 
the levels very easy um once you've
beaten<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> second<00:02:25.310> version<00:02:25.550> quite<00:02:26.180> no<00:02:26.360> no<00:02:26.480> no

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
beaten the second version quite no no no

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.300 
beaten the second version quite no no no
once<00:02:26.840> you've<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.440> gone<00:02:27.709> through<00:02:27.770> here<00:02:28.160> that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
once you've just gone through here that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.010 
once you've just gone through here that
with<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> bow<00:02:28.670> winner<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.240> don't<00:02:29.600> know<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
with the bow winner but I don't know I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.990 
with the bow winner but I don't know I
don't<00:02:30.680> know<00:02:30.800> if<00:02:30.920> there's<00:02:31.070> any<00:02:31.220> specific<00:02:31.760> part

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
don't know if there's any specific part

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.510 
don't know if there's any specific part
I<00:02:32.209> know<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.540> didn't<00:02:32.840> even<00:02:32.870> test<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.520> shooter

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
I know I didn't even test that shooter

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
I know I didn't even test that shooter
really<00:02:35.020> but<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.050> think<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.380> when<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> go

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
really but I think it's just when you go

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.100 
really but I think it's just when you go
through<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.010> door<00:02:37.250> oh<00:02:37.670> no<00:02:38.209> eny<00:02:38.720> its<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.020> you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
through that door oh no eny its if you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.540 
through that door oh no eny its if you
get<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.350> dried<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.890> that's<00:02:40.010> probably<00:02:40.160> what

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
get that dried and that's probably what

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.130 
get that dried and that's probably what
it<00:02:40.580> probably<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.150> actually

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it probably is actually

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.370 
it probably is actually
test<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.220> any<00:02:43.370> more

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
test that if there any more

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
test that if there any more
say<00:02:45.980> look<00:02:46.100> we've<00:02:46.490> got<00:02:46.520> like<00:02:46.820> 300<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.810> like<00:02:49.090> 30

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
say look we've got like 300 and like 30

makers<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.260> dream<00:04:36.440> weavers<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.070> couldn't

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
makers and dream weavers I couldn't

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.700 
makers and dream weavers I couldn't
really<00:04:37.760> put<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.120> my<00:04:38.390> finger<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.810> what<00:04:39.410> kind<00:04:39.620> of

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
really put it my finger on what kind of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.040 
really put it my finger on what kind of
level<00:04:39.950> they<00:04:40.070> want<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:41.210> thought<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
level they want because I thought the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.450 
level they want because I thought the
best<00:04:42.080> bakers<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.740> removes<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.250> most

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
best bakers and removes the most

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.450 
best bakers and removes the most
creative<00:04:43.670> walls<00:04:44.480> in<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.720> game<00:04:45.130> beach<00:04:46.130> bag<00:04:46.310> is

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
creative walls in the game beach bag is

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.720 
creative walls in the game beach bag is
probably<00:04:46.760> more<00:04:47.060> than<00:04:47.360> dream<00:04:47.690> weavers<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
probably more than dream weavers and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
probably more than dream weavers and
that's<00:04:49.910> why<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.060> these<00:04:50.330> bankers<00:04:50.630> this

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
that's why I like these bankers this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.900 
that's why I like these bankers this
wall<00:04:50.960> that's<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.530> some<00:04:51.800> kind<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.430> original

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
wall that's like some kind of original

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.560 
wall that's like some kind of original
compared<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:54.490> dream<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.610> us<00:04:55.730> yeah<00:04:55.940> okay<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:56.450> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570
