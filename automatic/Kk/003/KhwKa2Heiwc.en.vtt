00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.560
 in general, guys, I welcome everyone again 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.390
 Today I want you how to get 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 fire with the already used 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.349
 lighters often happen that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 if your campaign is over every 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 vein chased in other ways 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 No, I'll show you how to do it. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.810
 already with used lighter main 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 so that we still have the Kremushek gas start 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.519
 will not be but that the jailers we take 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.750
 dismantle the lighter 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.369
 my case is the clipper therefore 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 understands just such a clicker them and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 I have been using not for the first year in general 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.030
 a little lucky because with the creeper 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 do it a little bit easier in general 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 we get in this case with the creeper 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 kremushki so if you have the usual simple 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.770
 when the chinese lighter you need 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.750
 take off will mean this windproof 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.750
 little ring and what should we do with you 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 yaga along with not put leaves because 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 what will be seen on it approximately 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.180
 the amount of this cream is some to us 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 need to kindle a fire 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 now we take this cream and start 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.960
 rotate it back and forth 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960
 Well, we do not do full movements otherwise we 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 everything will flare up and also not bring very 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 kremushek close 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.500
 in the shavings you already sawed 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.070
 by such simple manipulations we 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.020
 download kremushki this way not yet 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 known since childhood but never him 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.170
 put into practice until some times 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.360
 basically really indulged now 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.570
 we you helped develop a fire and in 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 general, while I was talking to you here , I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 I think that you can already see that small 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.060
 the amount of cream I have already collected this 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.630
 so not enough so we are probably 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 let's continue 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.200
 I repeat that it is desirable not to press 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.700
 some distance 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 lighter from your exact cream otherwise 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 1 here's how to see one little spark and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 all our business will go down the drain therefore 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:15.510
 keep the distance it will take 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.740
 a few minutes a little less of course in 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 In general, wait another couple of minutes and all 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.820
 we will be fine, I want to naturally 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.820
 more but to read it and clarity 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.489
 In principle, such an amount is enough 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.580
 now you need to prepare the guys 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.560
 work should be desirable and such 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.360
 so that it quickly ignites for example and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.610
 I will use to use the old one 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.349
 pine stick she is very strong 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.739
 oiled so on lights up 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:10.659
 almost from one spark i use 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.430
 because how would I have it on 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.090
 in fact , all souls will find pines 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.319
 which is soaked in resin you can 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.700
 use wool for example either friends 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.900
 some assistants once general but I think 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.200
 I also had this amount 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.260
 enough no i'm not going to name 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.909
 kindle is simple and do for you 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.519
 small instruction well, and I think this 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.150
 quantities with major will be quite 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.150
 enough 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.890
 now neatly pour our 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.890
 kremushki developed buds 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.230
 Now we take the same kremushek 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:12.260
 let's not get a little bit closer like this 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:18.380
 here neatly bring kremushki or 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:22.840
 lighter voila but this time it's all 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.840
 thanks for watching until new meetings
