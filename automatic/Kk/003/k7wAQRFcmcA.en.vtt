00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
doing but in the sense that we needed to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
doing but in the sense that we needed to
use<00:01:05.970> every<00:01:06.420> single<00:01:06.630> PCIe<00:01:07.520> lane<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:09.689> needed<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
use every single PCIe lane we needed to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.340 
use every single PCIe lane we needed to
use<00:01:10.470> every<00:01:11.070> onboard<00:01:11.729> controller<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.600> USB<00:01:13.020> 3

there<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> i<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.360> every<00:02:00.810> port<00:02:01.079> jammed<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.560> i

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
there so i have every port jammed up i

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.340 
there so i have every port jammed up i
am<00:02:02.219> using<00:02:02.399> USB<00:02:02.880> 3<00:02:03.149> across<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.700> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
am using USB 3 across all of them and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.650 
am using USB 3 across all of them and
what<00:02:07.350> should<00:02:07.740> ultimately<00:02:08.459> slow<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.599> thing

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
what should ultimately slow this thing

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.820 
what should ultimately slow this thing
down<00:02:09.869> quite<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.440> isn't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
down quite a bit isn't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.220 
down quite a bit isn't
this<00:02:12.760> has<00:02:13.000> been<00:02:13.030> rocks<00:02:13.450> i'll<00:02:13.630> be<00:02:13.750> running<00:02:14.020> this

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
this has been rocks i'll be running this

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.770 
this has been rocks i'll be running this
for<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> couple<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.650> months<00:02:14.710> now<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.750> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
for a couple of months now this is a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.190 
for a couple of months now this is a
media<00:02:17.140> center<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.850> know<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.360> were<00:02:19.540> running

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
media center you know we were running

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.250 
media center you know we were running
movies<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.300> doing<00:02:22.300> transfers<00:02:22.810> doing

movies and doing transfers doing
everything<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.710> same<00:02:23.860> time<00:02:24.130> and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
everything at the same time and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.940 
everything at the same time and
everything<00:02:24.700> has<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:24.940> been<00:02:25.240> beautiful<00:02:25.690> I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
everything has just been beautiful I

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.870 
everything has just been beautiful I
should<00:02:26.950> point<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.400> i'm<00:02:27.490> running<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
should point out that i'm running the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.610 
should point out that i'm running the
Zeon<00:02:28.210> in<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.750> particular<00:02:28.900> system<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.560> will

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
Zeon in this particular system it will

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.610 
Zeon in this particular system it will
run<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> VIII's<00:02:30.490> eons<00:02:31.020> which<00:02:32.020> are<00:02:32.200> beautiful

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
run the VIII's eons which are beautiful

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.290 
run the VIII's eons which are beautiful
because<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.070> get<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> extra<00:02:33.580> pcie<00:02:33.970> lanes

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
because you get the extra pcie lanes

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.520 
because you get the extra pcie lanes
although<00:02:35.110> they're<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:35.410> necessarily

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
although they're not necessarily

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.060 
although they're not necessarily
required<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.500> motherboard<00:02:38.830> to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
required for this motherboard to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.450 
required for this motherboard to
function<00:02:39.580> for<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.750> 4<00:02:41.050> X<00:02:41.500> 16<00:02:41.950> lanes<00:02:42.160> which

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
function for the 4 X 16 lanes which

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.530 
function for the 4 X 16 lanes which
again<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.700> think<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.970> what<00:02:43.120> most<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.450> would

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
again I think is what most of you would

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.660 
again I think is what most of you would
be<00:02:43.600> buying<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.460> because<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.550> has

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
be buying this for because it has

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.220 
be buying this for because it has
secondary<00:02:46.240> controllers<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.080> kind

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
secondary controllers on there to kind

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.260 
secondary controllers on there to kind
of<00:02:47.260> figure<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.650> logic<00:02:47.950> out<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.790> does<00:02:49.090> not

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
of figure that logic out it does not

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.730 
of figure that logic out it does not
hurt<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> does<00:02:50.020> speed<00:02:50.290> things<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.620> a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
hurt and it does speed things up a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.290 
hurt and it does speed things up a
little<00:02:50.860> bit<00:02:51.040> about<00:02:51.280> twenty<00:02:51.790> five<00:02:52.420> percent<00:02:52.560> so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
little bit about twenty five percent so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.120 
little bit about twenty five percent so
go<00:02:55.300> ahead<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.660> go<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:56.110> if<00:02:56.530> you're<00:02:56.830> if<00:02:57.010> you're

I'll<00:03:20.410> put<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.709> way<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.730> never<00:03:22.120> hurts<00:03:22.450> to

I'll put it that way it never hurts to

I'll put it that way it never hurts to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
