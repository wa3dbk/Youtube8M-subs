this year or something like that very
well<00:03:17.120> organized<00:03:17.570> much<00:03:18.500> better<00:03:18.710> than<00:03:18.890> other

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
well organized much better than other

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.790

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
conferences that do do things like this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.880 
conferences that do do things like this
and<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:23.150> really<00:03:23.600> helps<00:03:23.930> make<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.140> most<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
and it really helps make the most of the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.920 
and it really helps make the most of the
time<00:03:25.520> that's<00:03:25.730> available<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.540> one-to-one

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
time that's available the one-to-one

we've<00:03:31.190> got<00:03:31.370> something<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.850> 50<00:03:32.240> meetings

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
we've got something like 50 meetings

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.660 
we've got something like 50 meetings
over<00:03:33.410> two<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.710> half<00:03:33.830> days<00:03:34.040> they<00:03:34.610> were

over two and a half days they were
taking<00:03:35.000> advantage<00:03:35.420> of<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.020> format<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.700> want

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
taking advantage of of the format I want

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.730 
taking advantage of of the format I want
to<00:03:37.820> run<00:03:37.970> meetings<00:03:38.360> it's<00:03:38.600> also<00:03:38.780> Jamiel<00:03:39.320> idea

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740

this morning you now have a switch on

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.530 
this morning you now have a switch on
where<00:04:28.680> ourselves<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.760> airlines<00:04:30.270> are

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
where ourselves and the airlines are

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.890 
where ourselves and the airlines are
sitting<00:04:30.990> together<00:04:31.110> 5050<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.460> really<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:33.690> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
sitting together 5050 and really it's a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.530 
sitting together 5050 and really it's a
tour<00:04:34.139> was<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.650> on<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> industry<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.240> you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
tour was that on the industry if you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.620 
tour was that on the industry if you
kill<00:04:36.810> one<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.710> other<00:04:37.860> will<00:04:38.190> die<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.910> it's

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
kill one the other will die so it's

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:53.399 
kill one the other will die so it's
great

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.089 

I<00:04:54.179> think<00:04:55.179> GHI<00:04:55.839> adds<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.469> lot<00:04:56.649> to<00:04:56.709> the<00:04:56.889> grain

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
I think GHI adds a lot to the grain

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.889 
I think GHI adds a lot to the grain
handlers<00:04:57.459> because<00:04:57.699> often<00:04:57.999> it<00:04:58.479> pulls<00:04:58.749> us

00:04:58.889 --> 00:04:58.899 
handlers because often it pulls us

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.429 
handlers because often it pulls us
together<00:04:58.989> a<00:04:59.259> bit<00:05:00.599> we're<00:05:01.599> really<00:05:01.749> a<00:05:01.869> great<00:05:02.169> job

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
together a bit we're really a great job

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.499 
together a bit we're really a great job
to<00:05:02.739> the<00:05:02.860> industry<00:05:03.399> what<00:05:03.999> bringing<00:05:04.269> the

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
to the industry what bringing the

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.949 
to the industry what bringing the
industry<00:05:04.929> together<00:05:05.110> well<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.129> take<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.819> as<00:05:06.909> a

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:06.959 
industry together well I take it as a

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.149 
industry together well I take it as a
comprehensive<00:05:07.959> solution<00:05:08.529> to<00:05:09.009> getting

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
comprehensive solution to getting

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.129 
comprehensive solution to getting
information<00:05:09.429> and<00:05:09.969> actually<00:05:10.509> meeting<00:05:10.719> people

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
information and actually meeting people

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.839 
information and actually meeting people
in<00:05:11.229> networking<00:05:11.559> an<00:05:11.800> organization<00:05:12.399> whether

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
in networking an organization whether

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.159 
in networking an organization whether
it's<00:05:13.059> conference<00:05:13.479> or<00:05:13.629> whether<00:05:13.989> it's

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
it's conference or whether it's

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.989 
it's conference or whether it's
publications<00:05:14.739> so<00:05:15.189> it's<00:05:15.309> very<00:05:15.399> useful<00:05:15.789> for<00:05:15.819> us

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
publications so it's very useful for us

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.059 
publications so it's very useful for us
in<00:05:16.149> the<00:05:16.179> business<00:05:16.389> at<00:05:17.080> first<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.559> impression

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
in the business at first the impression

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.629 
in the business at first the impression
of<00:05:18.189> GHI<00:05:19.029> in<00:05:19.209> the<00:05:19.300> marketplace<00:05:19.959> I<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:22.300> think<00:05:22.809> that

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
of GHI in the marketplace I I think that

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.969 
of GHI in the marketplace I I think that
GHI<00:05:24.639> is<00:05:24.699> looked<00:05:25.059> at<00:05:25.239> as<00:05:25.269> as<00:05:25.959> certainly<00:05:26.829> the
