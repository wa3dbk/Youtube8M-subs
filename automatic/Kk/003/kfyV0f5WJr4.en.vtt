00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
thought this was a little bit more

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.550 
thought this was a little bit more
coarser<00:05:51.669> than<00:05:51.699> Barney<00:05:52.029> braid<00:05:52.330> hair<00:05:52.630> so<00:05:53.349> be

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
coarser than Barney braid hair so be

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.529 
coarser than Barney braid hair so be
careful<00:05:54.069> of<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.610> diplomatic<00:05:55.150> right<00:05:55.330> there's

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
careful of the diplomatic right there's

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.390 
careful of the diplomatic right there's
that<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:55.870> mix<00:05:56.770> because<00:05:56.949> you<00:05:57.039> don't<00:05:57.190> want<00:05:57.340> to

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
that you mix because you don't want to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.300 
that you mix because you don't want to
