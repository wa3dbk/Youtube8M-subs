00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
them near the US because they were an

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.150 
them near the US because they were an

and they were played in cinemas I think

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.700 
and they were played in cinemas I think
in<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.230> 1920s<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.699> 1930s<00:00:57.929> and<00:00:58.929> I<00:00:59.289> think<00:00:59.530> more

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
in the 1920s and 1930s and I think more

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.290 
in the 1920s and 1930s and I think more
recently<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.219> probably<00:01:00.460> find<00:01:00.670> them<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:00.879> pizza

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
recently you probably find them in pizza

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.049 
recently you probably find them in pizza
parlors<00:01:01.719> but<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:02.589> a<00:01:02.710> great<00:01:02.980> throaty<00:01:03.609> sound

you can't hear it because there's too

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.720

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
much spillage of noise but if you listen

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
