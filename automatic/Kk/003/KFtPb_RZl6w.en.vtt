00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.090
 Hello and welcome to the hospice 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 april with all yes i show them today 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.369
 not a gold coin but three on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.779
 all, I think it remains that is 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.930
 more exciting for you because she is the 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.800
 differences in the three 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.939
 best-selling gold coins but still 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.260
 gold coin speaks then it's time 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.120
 paper tissues paper bags the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290
 we know the term tempo then white 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.440
 everyone is meant 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.300
 and if someone says gold then he says 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.270
 usually yes I would like green edge 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.150
 why is it so the green edge is almost 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.390
 yes, the oldest gold coin of the modern times 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.920
 that was done , we have them 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.380
 Here we take a closer look 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.430
 then on one side the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.220
 politician paul kruger or kruger von 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.400
 South Africa and on the other side is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 the springbock on it we have to stop 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.689
 ounce coins yes that was just 19 67 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 the first time it came out, the kruger did 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.880
 no pronounced nominal value that is 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.970
 the prices daily by the current 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.920
 gold price is fixed but in south africa 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.159
 a recognized payment of course 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.440
 the green hand had known worldwide 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.940
 his best times in the 70s 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.470
 in the inflation time there were 74 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.470
 to 84 about two to six million 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.590
 krugerrand a year sells something 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.700
 gigantic number is because of 67 to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.370
 69 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.400
 there she has 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.400
 The coin has a circulation of 40,000 pieces 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 in the year and later just 260 pieces 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
 then the 1986 was decided 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.360
 that in the European 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.180
 community the krugerrand is prohibited 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.710
 and of course that's the paragraph 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.610
 declined sharply 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.750
 and since 99 is again only the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.750
 krugerrand just allows 90 that one 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.150
 banned and since then he has stopped 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.300
 again, but of course there can be 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.300
 old pay currently no longer 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.900
 rich indeed who ran a 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 copper's share is just over eight 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.380
 percent copper anyway they have 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.780
 of course with an ounce or an ounce 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.880
 Krugerrand one of our gold lies 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 more then that's the krugerrand 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.770
 in the one and form wants with 33 93 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.810
 gramm so almost 34 grams and of course 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.720
 just there the one ounce of gold in it 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.130
 contained and in copper one has just 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.400
 attached or copper attached with it 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.840
 The crane is even more stable and firm 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.850
 Of optician is natural 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.390
 a matter of taste 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.300
 So he looks just coppery from the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.670
 second party in the yes so partial 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.680
 even higher in years 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.100
 Meanwhile, as the krugerrand is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.700
 the Canadian maple leaf here in the picture 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:22.010
 The Canadian maple leaf is just whole 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.860
 great fine gold so even 99.9 in the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.080
 quality ever an ounce of 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.230
 Canadian maple leaf on one side 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.420
 side we always have the queen 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.360
 elizabeth 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.300
 and on the back the landmark 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.330
 Canada's hair sheet looks so 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.569
 awesome looking like golden 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.900
 should just after gold on the back 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:51.760
 fine gold on it is just fine gold 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 or watch tourist in french because 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.209
 here in Canada, we have a part 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.489
 French-speaking granata and 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:05.290
 english speaking granata therefore have 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:11.280
 We love it and drove for 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.430
 the French fancy so is yes 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.319
 means of payment 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.780
 Here we also have what we call it by 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.669
 Of course, 50 dollars is ours 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.160
 currently much more than this 50th 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.880
 dollar what they say it is the world 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.220
 five pieces with a weight of 100 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.220
 kilogram and a country of one 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.540
 million Canadian dollars so five 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.820
 pieces of which one of a very large 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.180
 coin and here you can see again 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.490
 look different at the same time suits edge 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.620
 and Canadian label ran i hope so 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.470
 Here comes something out of the krugerrand 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.810
 just copper colors and the fog was running 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:56.150
 nice gold color 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:00.820
 yes and one of my favorite coins is 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:04.400
 the australian market or australia 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.590
 kangaroo looks like we have 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.220
 Everybody is now last years 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.730
 year a change of kangaroo motif here 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.669
 it included the kangaroo which there is 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.190
 since 1986 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.820
 he was hung up there but only in the 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.100
 form as in Munster's nugget I say 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.460
 It looks like it was traveling then 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.190
 just wanted from the Australian gold rush 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:36.400
 show the biggest nack and the biggest one 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:40.880
 gold nugget had a weight of 1869 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.419
 72 kilograms of 72 kilograms so a 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.660
 giant gold nugget was found below 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.850
 water surface and on the tree yes 72 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.620
 kilogram, but then has the coin 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.710
 with the pictures very bad 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.080
 sold and then you have this it 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.120
 not set but just that 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.190
 coin picture changed in kangaroo 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.780
 show how the first looked 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.940
 on the basis of pictures here 1990 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.160
 had looked it so 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:23.000
 the name still australia neck 91 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:25.280
 92 93 and in 2008 the name became 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.039
 but something changed here in 2007 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.289
 second act and since 28 australia 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.719
 kangaroo so if it's getting older 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:37.099
 have in front of me that I wonder then that 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:39.469
 is therefore the same series of the 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.839
 Australians from the stock exchange says something great 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:45.080
 is or what is funny is the fit 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:47.240
 every year something of the motive of 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.849
 Queen Elizabeth to that is called 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.919
 albert here, so to speak, with the 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.830
 maple leaf see the queen 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:58.899
 Elizabeth still relatively young where the 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:04.580
 medium middle age and up to date 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:06.889
 2013 when kangaroo is a little older funny 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.349
 even small details to laugh 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.689
 even under the eyes so really nice 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.270
 made and I personally like the 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.639
 incredibly good this kangaroo said 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.800
 every year to the coins and what 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.680
 great that is always encapsulated 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.330
 Delivered in coin capsule 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.939
 there she is in there I have the before now 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.349
 just not taken out with it 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:31.999
 can show better afterwards 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:34.129
 but this always encapsulates and stays 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:37.699
 of course then in one 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:40.610
 excellent condition yes in this 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:43.159
 think trains next to run and 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.080
 Australia knows shouts they look what 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:47.089
 we have to order because everything can 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.309
 get if what is currently in stock 

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:52.569
 in this sense, thank you for listening for 

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:52.569
 watch bye bye 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.710
