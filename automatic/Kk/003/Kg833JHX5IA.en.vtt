00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
I like this part this is very

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.290 
I like this part this is very
characteristic<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:08.040> New<00:00:08.189> York<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.639> feel<00:00:09.179> like

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
characteristic of New York and feel like

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.580 
characteristic of New York and feel like
I<00:00:09.360> can't<00:00:09.540> really<00:00:09.660> leave<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> city<00:00:10.139> without<00:00:10.290> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I can't really leave the city without it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.230 
I can't really leave the city without it
it<00:00:10.710> just<00:00:10.889> gives<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.400> statement<00:00:11.700> basically

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it just gives you a statement basically

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.460 
it just gives you a statement basically
so<00:00:12.630> that's<00:00:12.929> why<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:15.170> design<00:00:16.170> very

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
so that's why we like it design very

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.160 
so that's why we like it design very
often<00:00:16.949> demands<00:00:17.760> an<00:00:18.029> interval<00:00:18.420> between<00:00:18.449> seeing

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
often demands an interval between seeing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.439 
often demands an interval between seeing
and<00:00:19.380> understanding<00:00:19.670> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> case<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.240> Love

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to be a puzzle everybody solves

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.330 
to be a puzzle everybody solves
immediately<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> result<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> it

immediately and as a result of that it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:50.550 
immediately and as a result of that it
stays<00:00:38.790> fixed<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> memory

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.400 

people<00:00:51.250> were<00:00:51.370> moving<00:00:51.730> out<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:51.910> New<00:00:52.180> York<00:00:52.410> by

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
because the place itself had become so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
because the place itself had become so
difficult<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.670> live<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:00.850> crime<00:01:01.600> was<00:01:01.870> rampant<00:01:02.290> I

New<00:01:13.990> York<00:01:14.200> was<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> manifestation<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.670> that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
New York was a manifestation of that

afterwards<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.470> realized<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.070> wasn't<00:01:24.250> good

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
afterwards I realized it wasn't good

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.790 
afterwards I realized it wasn't good
enough<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:25.150> was<00:01:25.360> really<00:01:25.750> forgettable<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.590> mean

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
incredibly more pervasive than I ever

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.300

dreamed

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.860 

it<00:02:13.310> seemed<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.820> me<00:02:13.970> there<00:02:14.180> was<00:02:14.240> almost<00:02:14.390> no<00:02:14.690> way

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it seemed to me there was almost no way

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.220 
it seemed to me there was almost no way
of<00:02:15.050> avoiding<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.430> issue<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.970> global<00:02:17.930> warming

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
of avoiding the issue of global warming

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.080 
of avoiding the issue of global warming
but<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.920> had<00:02:19.040> all<00:02:19.190> heard<00:02:19.520> about<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.940> so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
but we had all heard about it so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.170 
but we had all heard about it so
frequently<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.710> have<00:02:21.860> become<00:02:22.280> immune<00:02:22.910> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
frequently that we have become immune to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.510 
frequently that we have become immune to
the<00:02:23.420> experience<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.290> came<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.310> line

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
the experience I came up with the line

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.590 
the experience I came up with the line
it's<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.440> warming<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:28.520> dying<00:02:28.940> because<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
it's not warming it's dying because the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.480 
it's not warming it's dying because the
idea<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:29.990> global<00:02:30.380> warming<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.040> sort<00:02:31.340> of
