class<00:01:14.460> i<00:01:14.670> shall<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.450> pretty<00:01:15.689> much<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
class i shall we and it's pretty much to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
class i shall we and it's pretty much to
class<00:01:17.040> setups<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> only<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
class setups but the only thing that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.350 
class setups but the only thing that
changes<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> perfect<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.970> classes

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
changes is perfect three so the classes

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.520 
changes is perfect three so the classes
should<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.600> popping<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> screen<00:01:22.470> right

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

back<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.040> pretty<00:02:24.280> much<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.760> risky

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
back out this is pretty much a risky

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.530 
back out this is pretty much a risky
class<00:02:25.840> setup<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.920> not<00:02:27.220> bad<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
class setup but it's not bad and the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.170 
class setup but it's not bad and the
reason<00:02:28.780> i<00:02:29.020> added<00:02:29.440> rapid<00:02:30.100> fire<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.700> because

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
reason i added rapid fire on it because

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.570 
reason i added rapid fire on it because
i<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.540> using<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.020> variant<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.980> k<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.310> five<00:02:33.550> i

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
i was using a variant of the k of five i

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.850 
i was using a variant of the k of five i
think<00:02:33.970> who<00:02:34.060> spent<00:02:34.330> elite<00:02:34.690> care<00:02:34.960> five<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> i

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
think who spent elite care five and i

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.620 
think who spent elite care five and i
noticed<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> fire<00:02:36.820> rate<00:02:37.060> was<00:02:37.210> pushed<00:02:37.480> up

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
noticed that the fire rate was pushed up

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.510 
noticed that the fire rate was pushed up
on<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.140> gun<00:02:38.650> was<00:02:39.150> such<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.800> beast<00:02:41.800> but

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
on it and that gun was such a beast but

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.400

the on socks for throw me off I can't

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.860 
the on socks for throw me off I can't
use<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.040> like<00:02:45.370> i<00:02:45.490> said<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:46.000> gun<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.330> built

file you're gonna notice a dramatic
change<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.250> for<00:03:00.430> us<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> event<00:03:01.030> is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
change and for us the event is

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
change and for us the event is
rightfully<00:03:01.720> i'm<00:03:02.260> guessing<00:03:02.680> idiot<00:03:03.010> i<00:03:03.100> take

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
rightfully i'm guessing idiot i take

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.640 
rightfully i'm guessing idiot i take
longer<00:03:03.760> shots<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.570> what<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> should<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.620> I

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
longer shots to do what I should so I

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.620 
longer shots to do what I should so I
just<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.250> made<00:03:06.459> sense<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.850> me<00:03:06.940> personally<00:03:07.330> to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
just just made sense to me personally to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.080 
just just made sense to me personally to
tag<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.959> on<00:03:08.080> there<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:09.250> class<00:03:09.520> setup<00:03:09.910> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
tag it on there but this class setup it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.660 
tag it on there but this class setup it
works<00:03:10.480> very<00:03:10.750> fine<00:03:11.650> for<00:03:11.860> me<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.220> notice<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
works very fine for me if you notice the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.360 
works very fine for me if you notice the
only<00:03:13.030> thing<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.480> changes<00:03:13.959> between<00:03:14.739> these

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
only thing that changes between these

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.760 
only thing that changes between these
two<00:03:15.640> class<00:03:15.910> setups<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:17.020> my<00:03:17.170> other<00:03:17.470> one

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
two class setups is that on my other one

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.420 
two class setups is that on my other one
on<00:03:17.980> my<00:03:18.430> perk<00:03:18.760> 3<00:03:19.209> i'm<00:03:19.630> only<00:03:19.930> using<00:03:20.430> scavenger

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.580 
and blast suppressor it really depends
on<00:03:24.730> how<00:03:24.910> i<00:03:24.940> feel<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.330> day<00:03:25.570> sometimes<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.500> don't

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
on how i feel that day sometimes I don't

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.290 
on how i feel that day sometimes I don't
need<00:03:26.830> toughness<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.489> sometimes<00:03:27.850> my<00:03:28.030> chest

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
need toughness and sometimes my chest

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.080 
need toughness and sometimes my chest
I'm<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.230> accurate<00:03:29.860> my<00:03:30.010> shot<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.790> point

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
I'm just so accurate my shot is on point

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.210 
I'm just so accurate my shot is on point
but<00:03:31.360> like<00:03:31.600> earlier<00:03:32.019> today<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.560> was<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:32.980> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
but like earlier today it was just it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.729 
but like earlier today it was just it
was<00:03:33.280> messy<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:33.940> had<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.420> use<00:03:34.600> toughness<00:03:35.410> with

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
was messy I had to use toughness with

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.580 
was messy I had to use toughness with
the<00:03:35.860> scavenger<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.330> quick<00:03:38.200> reload

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
the scavenger and I like to quick reload

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.220 
the scavenger and I like to quick reload
versus<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.880> standard<00:03:40.150> reloj<00:03:40.690> even<00:03:41.080> though

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
versus the standard reloj even though

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.990 
versus the standard reloj even though
when<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.590> quick<00:03:41.890> reload<00:03:42.220> when<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.550> double

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
when you quick reload when you double

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.270 
when you quick reload when you double
tap<00:03:43.120> ex<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.870> lose<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.290> entire<00:03:44.530> clip<00:03:44.860> but<00:03:45.070> I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
tap ex you lose the entire clip but I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
tap ex you lose the entire clip but I
have<00:03:45.610> scavenger<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.209> really<00:03:46.480> don't<00:03:46.600> worry

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
have scavenger so I really don't worry

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140 
have scavenger so I really don't worry
about<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.350> now<00:03:48.070> someone<00:03:48.640> not<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.940> may<00:03:49.090> be

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
about that now someone not that may be
