00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends this is channel plugins we 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.340
 continue the line without useful mods 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.059
 for the game spintires and today we have on 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.830
 review subaru impreza with that yes like this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.490
 here she looks like this here she has 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490
 wheels 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.670
 animation mudguards if I know more precisely 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 As far as I know, the model has no 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.580
 envelopes and erased optics working here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 so here but I would even become mediocre 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.210
 Well, at least something that is, so let's 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.149
 let's get the engine as interesting 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 yes it is put well as the native sound 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.710
 native relative native sound for this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.600
 she has a few punctuation machines 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's see you open the hood and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 see what she has inside well yes 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.660
 something about worked done done 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
 traced 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 but on what keeps the hood of these here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 loop them no well for this game yet 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.240
 somehow judge 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.200
 appearance of the car for the game about 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 trucks it somehow I think not quite 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 correctly left door pro be able and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 the trunk opens with us like this 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.650
 It all looks well, in principle, that's behind 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.619
 there are these loops here and here in front 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.140
 no, but it's still my niggle so 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.120
 so here 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.479
 looks from the top of the hood 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.520
 something like this 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.430
 take it away from us 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.200
 I understand permanent four-wheel drive and 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.320
 either permanent front-wheel drive 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.479
 the community should not be complete but something I 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 I do not watch so much Well 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.960
 let's see what anton is in him and 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.730
 honestly I don’t know so badly with the handbrake 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.860
 highly 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.200
 so well anyway let's see what u 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.360
 we have we have spare tire i 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.060
 even gave that there will be no addons 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.420
 there is a spare tire and headlights 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.580
 and the headlight will even work with us 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 will work and maybe even from them 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.840
 this is not only from them will not 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.850
 absolutely can be if not included 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 no sense from them we put them and not 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.280
 we still do not give a hundred points repair 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.150
 leave it so you can put 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.930
 off-road wheels everyone understands this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 earlier though why everything is so 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.290
 wheel number two is what do we have to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.990
 Parent I do not know why everything is so 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.870
 are skeptical of such a mod Well 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.480
 clean install so go but here 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 I personally this mod I even have a little bit 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.840
 sympathetic I first thought that in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.840
 Generally something next to God 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.190
 I don't even know what to call it, but these 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.740
 Here are the wheels, in principle, the rally you yes if 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.020
 another card about it 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.930
 how do we have to pick up the same 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.550
 will be just a find why not 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.550
 let's then hung on asphalt 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:27.030
 and then try on the ground 4 gears 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:32.280
 something well, not and op op op is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.150
 not good let's go get out so well 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.150
 still quite 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.470
 then why choose a lock ? 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.590
 no it can't be 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.459
 yes seriously can not live 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.510
 so continue to be with this 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.349
 more carefully okay well remembered 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.349
 go further 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.260
 I don’t feel any control 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.180
 cars are absolutely animation because they are just 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.150
 centuries you ca n't resist where you taste you 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.470
 climbed then wait listen better 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.110
 will be from the hood 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.730
 let's see maybe 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.730
 somehow it will be better or not 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.620
 so we already picked up speed 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:11.510
 matching no no no legends 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.380
 from almost the same damage did not get it 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.380
 great guys 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.659
 did not go there 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.939
 did n't even go there 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.840
 refueling so here it is already starting damage 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:29.750
 turned out but I want to say that we have 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.520
 over the map we have 60 liters 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:43.219
 fuel and 400 damage can get on 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:45.050
 this car so well everything is left only 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:49.479
 it seems everyone looked only left 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.479
 find somewhere and any turn 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.440
 and try it on the roads like on 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.350
 off road have u on more or less 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.290
 decent road so here i go there 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.870
 don't want to leave let's turn on the divine 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.600
 camera though with skype on what's in 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.479
 not bad in principle 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.120
 no so bad stand under in perfectly 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.660
 overall not so worth it with tackle stand 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.660
 let's go right 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.989
 why then here is the last subarik he was 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:24.599
 powerful enough this some 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:27.089
 clumsy that still clings all 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:31.349
 turn on the axis off we will 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:34.109
 live you will not come he wears from the side 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:40.249
 side he starts to slip 

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:40.249
 like this is all down with us all 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.830
 strange model in my opinion and erased from the side 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:53.680
 written on the numbers in the grid whom 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:55.600
 I believe do not know do not know are not well 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.630
 no web show us here will be different 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.070
 we'll just break it in the trash 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:06.850
 huge just the amount of damage something 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.460
 like this just three hundred so external 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.540
 no deformations they just 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:17.020
 no, let's drive around a minute 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.150
 looking down it was supposed to be you 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.720
 cabin but it looks like 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.720
 so here 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.770
 so nothing to do to leaves something 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.500
 let's start altogether stopped driving 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:39.419
 refuse at all any way 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.419
 contact that's all we are dead 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.099
 completely are dead Well ride 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.479
 have looked 

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:48.789
 I wonder why not subscribe 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:51.069
 write comments to the channel 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:53.169

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.789

 bye everyone
