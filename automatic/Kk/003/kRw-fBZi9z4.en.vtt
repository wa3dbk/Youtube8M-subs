points<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.780> level<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.260> let's<00:02:25.440> take<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> look

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
points that level up let's take a look

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.570 
points that level up let's take a look
at<00:02:26.190> capture<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.180> flag<00:02:27.620> where<00:02:28.620> yours<00:02:29.070> truly

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
at capture the flag where yours truly

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.180 
at capture the flag where yours truly
actually<00:02:30.420> captured<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.960> flag<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> few<00:02:31.560> times

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
actually captured the flag a few times

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
actually captured the flag a few times
normally<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.300> too<00:02:33.450> busy<00:02:33.600> dying<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.380> that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
normally I'm too busy dying to do that

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.980 
normally I'm too busy dying to do that
but<00:02:34.920> after<00:02:35.700> memorizing<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.330> few<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> levels

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
but after memorizing a few of the levels

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.500 
but after memorizing a few of the levels
it<00:02:37.170> turned<00:02:37.800> out<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.280> fun<00:02:38.580> challenge<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
it turned out to be a fun challenge the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
it turned out to be a fun challenge the
levels<00:02:40.140> themselves<00:02:40.260> are<00:02:40.770> fairly<00:02:40.980> standard

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
levels themselves are fairly standard

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.940 
levels themselves are fairly standard
nothing<00:02:41.970> really<00:02:42.330> stands<00:02:42.690> out<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.590> basically

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
nothing really stands out it basically

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.620 
nothing really stands out it basically
looked<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.310> multiplayer<00:02:44.820> levels<00:02:45.030> based<00:02:45.360> on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
looked like multiplayer levels based on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930 
looked like multiplayer levels based on
levels<00:02:45.990> from<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> campaign<00:02:46.710> like<00:02:47.220> usual<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
levels from the campaign like usual the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.820 
levels from the campaign like usual the
games<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.600> playing<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.260> play

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
games that I was playing have you play

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.590 
games that I was playing have you play
as<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.250> humans<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:50.910> one<00:02:51.060> part<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.450> level

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
as the humans for one part of the level

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.510 
as the humans for one part of the level
then<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.930> flips<00:02:52.080> over<00:02:52.350> after<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> win<00:02:53.400> or

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
then it flips over after you win or

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.760

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
a fast connection speed I'm satisfied

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.470 
a fast connection speed I'm satisfied
and<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.160> think<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.700> pick<00:03:30.910> up<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.240> game<00:03:31.450> you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
and I think if you pick up the game you

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.130 
and I think if you pick up the game you
will<00:03:31.990> be<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.560> its<00:03:32.860> resistance<00:03:33.820> 3<00:03:34.210> let's<00:03:34.870> watch

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
will be to its resistance 3 let's watch

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:52.640 
will be to its resistance 3 let's watch
some<00:03:35.380> explosions<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.220> mayhem
