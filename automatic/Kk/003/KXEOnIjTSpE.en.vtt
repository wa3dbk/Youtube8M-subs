disc inserted and I'll give me playing
right<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> legally<00:00:25.920> own<00:00:26.220> it

right here so you know I legally own it

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:39.639 
right here so you know I legally own it
let's<00:00:27.599> see

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.950 

now<00:00:40.190> formatted<00:00:40.760> this<00:00:41.059> came<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.539> actually

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
now formatted this came to actually

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.389 
now formatted this came to actually
about<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.170> hundred<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.649> eight<00:00:42.829> gigabytes

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
about a hundred and eight gigabytes

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.270 
about a hundred and eight gigabytes
really<00:00:43.850> square<00:00:44.239> enix

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.939 

and<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.519> can<00:00:49.670> see<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:52.730> actually<00:00:53.800> just<00:00:54.800> as

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
and as you can see it's actually just as

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:05.350 
and as you can see it's actually just as
fast<00:00:55.219> as<00:00:55.550> anything<00:00:56.059> else

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:22.469 

games<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.540> movies<00:01:10.750> lit<00:01:11.750> up<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.080> fine

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.050 

it<00:01:23.049> could<00:01:23.200> take<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.380> few<00:01:23.560> moments<00:01:23.680> sometimes<00:01:24.610> to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
it could take a few moments sometimes to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.359 
it could take a few moments sometimes to
you<00:01:25.360> know<00:01:25.509> load<00:01:26.259> up<00:01:26.409> your<00:01:26.439> selection<00:01:27.130> of

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
you know load up your selection of

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.810 
you know load up your selection of
titles<00:01:27.850> but<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.549> most<00:01:30.700> part

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
titles but for the most part

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
titles but for the most part
everything's<00:01:31.360> fine

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
everything's fine

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:50.210 
everything's fine
so<00:01:32.979> for<00:01:33.310> example<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> my<00:01:36.270> videos

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.010 

anyway<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.030> show<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.390> how<00:01:52.810> it's

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
anyway so to show you that how it's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.770 
anyway so to show you that how it's
actually<00:01:53.200> working<00:01:53.649> now<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.689> know

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
actually working now now that you know

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.899 
actually working now now that you know
that<00:01:55.810> actually<00:01:56.110> does<00:01:56.439> work<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:57.610> right<00:01:57.640> I'm

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
that actually does work all right I'm

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
that actually does work all right I'm
going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.149> turn<00:01:58.299> this<00:01:58.450> off

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
going to turn this off

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.830 
going to turn this off
and<00:02:01.350> open<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.740> show<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.729> card<00:02:04.030> now

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and open it up and show you the card now

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.529 
and open it up and show you the card now
you<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.439> be<00:02:05.500> very<00:02:05.850> careful<00:02:06.850> when<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.360> do

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
you have to be very careful when you do

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.109 
you have to be very careful when you do
this<00:02:08.050> method<00:02:08.470> or<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.009> could<00:02:09.220> lose<00:02:09.489> all<00:02:09.789> of

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
this method or you could lose all of

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.780 
this method or you could lose all of
your<00:02:10.269> games<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.410> also<00:02:11.620> has<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.069> trick<00:02:12.610> to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
your games and it also has a trick to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.160 
your games and it also has a trick to
actually<00:02:13.120> getting<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.569> work<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.870> begin

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
actually getting it to work to begin

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.259 
actually getting it to work to begin
with<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:16.440> smart<00:02:17.440> dual<00:02:17.800> reader<00:02:18.269> for

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
with this is a smart dual reader for

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.800 
with this is a smart dual reader for
micro<00:02:19.599> SD<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:21.130> put<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> micro<00:02:21.760> SD<00:02:22.060> card<00:02:22.330> here

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
micro SD you put a micro SD card here

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.610 
micro SD you put a micro SD card here
and<00:02:22.930> here<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.180> put<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.720> into<00:02:26.080> your

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
and here and then you put this into your

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.390 
and here and then you put this into your
PSP<00:02:27.480> now<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.870> has<00:02:28.989> been<00:02:29.140> done<00:02:29.319> before<00:02:29.500> with

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
PSP now this has been done before with

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.570 
PSP now this has been done before with
the<00:02:30.610> 2<00:02:30.940> 32<00:02:31.269> gigabytes<00:02:31.840> I've<00:02:32.110> seen<00:02:32.350> but<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.459> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
the 2 32 gigabytes I've seen but in this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.720 
the 2 32 gigabytes I've seen but in this
one<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:33.940> using<00:02:34.120> two<00:02:34.420> 64<00:02:35.140> gigabyte<00:02:35.590> micro<00:02:36.400> SD

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
one I'm using two 64 gigabyte micro SD

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.539 
one I'm using two 64 gigabyte micro SD
cards<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:38.230> here's<00:02:38.799> where<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.099> challenge

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
cards now here's where the challenge

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.990 
cards now here's where the challenge
comes<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:40.049> these<00:02:41.049> come<00:02:41.500> pre<00:02:41.860> formatted<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.849> if

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
comes in these come pre formatted and if

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.100 
comes in these come pre formatted and if
you<00:02:43.090> put<00:02:43.330> these<00:02:43.540> together<00:02:43.780> onto<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.560> card<00:02:45.010> and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you put these together onto a card and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.509 
you put these together onto a card and
try<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.799> format<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.310> it'll<00:02:49.180> actually<00:02:49.360> only<00:02:49.930> see

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
try to format it it'll actually only see

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.199 
try to format it it'll actually only see
64<00:02:51.519> gigabytes

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
64 gigabytes

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.270 
64 gigabytes
if<00:02:52.299> each<00:02:52.750> card<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.290> properly<00:02:53.739> formatted<00:02:53.950> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
if each card is properly formatted to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.750 
if each card is properly formatted to
begin<00:02:54.579> with<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.720> trick<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.760> essentially

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
begin with the trick is to essentially

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640 
begin with the trick is to essentially
corrupt<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.480> format<00:02:58.870> when<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.079> first<00:02:59.290> set<00:02:59.530> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
corrupt the format when you first set it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.550 
corrupt the format when you first set it
up<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.730> don't<00:03:00.940> want<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.269> format<00:03:02.109> each<00:03:02.230> card

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
up you don't want to format each card

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.349 
up you don't want to format each card
separately<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.130> fat32<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.239> them

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
separately to fat32 you want to do them

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.199 
separately to fat32 you want to do them
all<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:04.720> single<00:03:05.319> card<00:03:05.850> now<00:03:06.850> if<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> have

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
all as one single card now if you have

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.030 
all as one single card now if you have
that<00:03:07.359> problem<00:03:07.540> where<00:03:07.870> your<00:03:07.959> computer<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.470> only

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
that problem where your computer is only

thing<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.359> worry<00:03:31.630> about<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.920> has<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.459> act

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
thing to worry about is this has to act

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.660 
thing to worry about is this has to act
as<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> single<00:03:34.209> unit<00:03:34.690> if<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.560> take<00:03:35.920> these<00:03:36.160> cards
