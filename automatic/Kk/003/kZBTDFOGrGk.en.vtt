 Step 1: Split all hair in two parts, stab it with clamps. 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.480
 Step 2: On the edge of the face on the left side of the part, select a narrow triangular section, divide it into three strands. From them start to weave the usual braid, perform one interweaving 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.580
 Step 3: Continue weaving the usual braid, but with the pickup on one side. Braid the left strand of the braid without a grab, that is, simply put it on the middle one. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.820
 Weave the right strand of the braid with a pick-up, that is, put it on the middle one, then separate the strand from the free hair on the right and connect it with the right strand of the braid. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 Step 4: Continue weaving the braid with a pickup on the right side along the edge hairline of the face. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.420
 Step 5: Loose the ends of the hair into a regular braid. 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 Step 6: Fasten the ends of the left braid with an elastic band. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:03:27.500
 Step 7: On the right side, perform the same weaving with a pickup on one side, but now the right side of the braid weave without pickup, and the left side with a pickup. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 Step 8: Loose the ends of the hair into a regular braid. Secure the ends of the right braid with a rubber band.
