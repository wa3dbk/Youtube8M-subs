olive<00:00:46.250> 140<00:00:47.250> denier<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.789> mean<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> actually

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
olive 140 denier I mean this is actually

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
olive 140 denier I mean this is actually
the<00:00:49.230> most<00:00:49.320> important<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> fly<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the most important part of the fly I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
the most important part of the fly I
think<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> 140<00:00:52.020> denier<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:53.100> you'll<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.550> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
think the 140 denier as you'll see you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.139 
think the 140 denier as you'll see you
later

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
later

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.130 
later
um<00:00:55.370> makes<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.360> fly<00:00:57.539> first<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> lot

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
um makes the fly first of all a lot

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
um makes the fly first of all a lot
easier<00:00:58.469> time<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.820> makes<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> look

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
easier time I think it makes it look

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
easier time I think it makes it look
better<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> we'll<00:01:01.980> start<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> B

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
better as well so we'll start with the B

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
length of the tail so about that far I'm

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.949 
length of the tail so about that far I'm
tied<00:04:00.639> in<00:04:00.819> on<00:04:00.940> my<00:04:01.090> side<00:04:01.389> first<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.900> just

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
tied in on my side first and just

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.220 
tied in on my side first and just
tighten<00:04:02.199> right<00:04:02.560> behind<00:04:02.829> that<00:04:02.980> B<00:04:03.250> chain<00:04:03.549> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
tighten right behind that B chain I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.599 
tighten right behind that B chain I
right<00:04:05.230> along<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.709> side<00:04:05.919> of<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.160> hook<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.400> I

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
right along the side of the hook and I

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.180 
right along the side of the hook and I
use<00:04:06.760> one<00:04:06.970> wrap<00:04:07.209> just<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.569> kind<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:09.010> my

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
use one wrap just to kind of get my

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.170 
use one wrap just to kind of get my
bearings<00:04:09.220> here<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:15.459> secure<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.030> with<00:04:16.060> a

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
bearings here and secure it with a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.349 
bearings here and secure it with a
second<00:04:16.630> wrap<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:18.250> flexi<00:04:18.729> floss<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.209> could

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
second wrap this flexi floss you could

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.240 
second wrap this flexi floss you could
use<00:04:19.570> some<00:04:20.169> other<00:04:20.320> leg<00:04:20.650> material<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:21.190> you

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
use some other leg material if you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.860 
use some other leg material if you
wanted<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.699> think<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.940> flexi<00:04:22.330> fossa<00:04:22.570> looks

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
wanted I think the flexi fossa looks

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.529 
wanted I think the flexi fossa looks
really<00:04:23.169> cool<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.880> behaves<00:04:24.880> erratically

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
really cool and it behaves erratically

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.969 
really cool and it behaves erratically
which<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.410> like<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.479> you<00:04:28.479> can<00:04:28.539> see<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:29.560> tied<00:04:29.800> in

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
which I like so you can see it's tied in

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.010 
which I like so you can see it's tied in
now<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:31.360> can<00:04:31.389> actually<00:04:32.039> trim<00:04:33.039> this<00:04:33.220> side<00:04:34.020> do

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
now you can actually trim this side do

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.029 
now you can actually trim this side do
about<00:04:35.199> where<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.470> want<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:38.409> last<00:04:38.650> step

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
about where you want it the last step

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.820 
about where you want it the last step
then<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.960> we're<00:04:41.139> going<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.289> take<00:04:41.470> some<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.740> this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
then is we're going to take some of this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.379 
then is we're going to take some of this
india<00:04:42.190> hand<00:04:42.449> right<00:04:43.449> here<00:04:43.659> and<00:04:44.530> just<00:04:44.560> select

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
india hand right here and just select

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:54.200 
india hand right here and just select
too<00:04:46.389> generous<00:04:46.870> feathers<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:50.099> preen<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.880> tips

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.550 

like<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.449> mean<00:04:55.810> just<00:04:56.020> kind<00:04:56.169> of<00:04:56.199> pull<00:04:56.409> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
like that I mean just kind of pull the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:06.909 
like that I mean just kind of pull the
fibers<00:04:56.919> back<00:04:57.099> so<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.370> looks<00:04:57.520> like<00:04:57.699> this

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.939 

and<00:05:07.400> then<00:05:07.669> match<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.439> feathers<00:05:09.439> up<00:05:09.710> like

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
and then match the the feathers up like

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.510 
and then match the the feathers up like
so<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:12.110> want<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.500> tie<00:05:12.650> them<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:13.069> so<00:05:13.370> they're

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
so you want to tie them in so they're

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.240 
so you want to tie them in so they're
facing<00:05:13.699> down<00:05:14.180> that<00:05:14.509> reason<00:05:14.990> is<00:05:15.229> so<00:05:15.889> that<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
facing down that reason is so that the

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.189 
facing down that reason is so that the
hackle<00:05:16.780> will<00:05:17.780> lay<00:05:19.539> backwards<00:05:20.539> when<00:05:20.870> we<00:05:21.020> wrap

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
hackle will lay backwards when we wrap

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.050 
hackle will lay backwards when we wrap
this<00:05:21.379> we<00:05:21.530> want<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.889> hackle<00:05:22.490> fibers<00:05:22.789> so<00:05:22.939> lay

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
this we want the hackle fibers so lay

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.990 
this we want the hackle fibers so lay
towards<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.449> back<00:05:23.629> of<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.900> fly<00:05:25.300> oopsie

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.080 

so<00:05:32.000> when<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.210> get<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.599> just<00:05:33.500> tire<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:34.090> come

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
so when you get that just tire in come

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.219 
so when you get that just tire in come
back<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.449> front<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:35.930> we're<00:05:36.050> going<00:05:36.199> to

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
back to the front and we're going to
