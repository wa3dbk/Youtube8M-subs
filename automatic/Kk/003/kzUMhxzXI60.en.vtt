resistance<00:00:25.630> rigid<00:00:26.589> resistant<00:00:27.039> I<00:00:27.159> mean<00:00:27.339> and<00:00:27.519> it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
resistance rigid resistant I mean and it

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.489 
resistance rigid resistant I mean and it
also<00:00:27.759> has<00:00:28.029> some<00:00:28.060> fire<00:00:28.509> resistant<00:00:29.109> to<00:00:29.289> it<00:00:29.380> as

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
well so you can see I mean these were

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.520 
well so you can see I mean these were
just<00:00:34.030> normal<00:00:34.390> two<00:00:34.510> by<00:00:34.660> fours<00:00:34.960> at<00:00:35.140> one<00:00:35.290> point

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
stain or the blue product here's a small

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.529 
stain or the blue product here's a small
piece<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.399> know<00:00:45.489> just<00:00:45.730> for<00:00:45.879> demonstration

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
piece you know just for demonstration

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.380 
piece you know just for demonstration
it's<00:00:47.019> easier<00:00:47.289> to<00:00:47.469> hang<00:00:47.859> onto<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.250> but<00:00:48.519> so<00:00:49.329> you
