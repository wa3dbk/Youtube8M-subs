00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.639
 welcome to this new video in which 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.560
 I will show you how to create a world in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.619
 super-flat single player though that is 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 what blocks are very deep there is not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 is that after three blocks and if the band is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 failed after 230 250 blocks this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.520
 it will be very useful for making constructions 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.649
 or things like that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 then started went on the single 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.239
 player fair creates a new world 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 here it puts all the name at random as it already is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 you know I will get the creative lech 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 survival as you wish 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.739
 from the other and powers to the world you do 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.710
 type world above plus act and go up 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.979
 customize subet do for settings 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 and click on turner's denim so if 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 you want the stone under the opposite earth 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 of the pet coke then access the belle 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 epoque because in the end if you want instead 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.920
 the the earth will put classic flat set 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 flat 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 if you want the desert, the sand 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 put desert then go on tunnel 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 stream is precarious and uses whose 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.939
 setting and this video you see vi 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.380
 the stone 230 will appear here at the bottom 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.159
 one would be beautiful after 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.600
 the 230 will go on the fact and I have 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.799
 written genre structures on 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.340
 if you stay on you allow that after a while 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:59.700
 god that is if you dig you will find materials 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:04.149
 that is to say, iron these things here 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 earth but if you do not find it instead 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.230
 nothing ie you will find only fine stone 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.209
 advent obviously I will put on 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.299
 jesus made creates new world the world yes 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.299
 generate you had to see 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.220

 beer you see and then in the end that is man 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 you will also find materials 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.950
 in fact , sometimes they are poorer than the earth 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.820
 so many would say seen it all 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.820

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.090

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:32.519
 happy because we did kind 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.909

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.410
