00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.640
 the coquito of the importance of proteins 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.769
 i want to walk a little bit in this point of view 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.740
 how are they classified to start and if there are any that are 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.899
 some kind that is more or less important 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.859
 miami these non-animal source proteins that tend to consume a step 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.030
 visit to targets in this case are vegetarian city who attended 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.399
 requirement stop making intelligent blends that can percent 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.890
 have a beautiful bioavailability as good as animal meat not only 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 in that case one can not be subject to analysis in detail the people that I 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 it's looking like 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.179
 the lentils with percent play and the serial kobe the stew 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.739
 cereal like milk dry matter like chestnut almonds 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.010
 nuts with yogurt or with that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 that is a month that the Zionist exists could guide you in a way 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 very punctual as a good idea because this way for minds in the country 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.710
 the message that but this note you inÃ©s animal source that between them we could 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 a classification 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 simple simple with for example the africa without iron not that the day is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.719
 or the beef sausage the clams to a very high tune 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.770
 no but there are also the rich in a beautiful makes a lot of your important 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.360
 be governed in the ejidos we are at the door of the palmita 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 per cent the rabbit's fault I can pass 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.850
 there are also those items that are rich in omega 3 that its imprint 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.229
 development of the baby cesena sardinada sancho vetoes percent but without 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.369
 However, be very careful the pregnant woman that her weekly consumption of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.780
 fish does not exceed 160 grams in the week 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.409
 we could say 120 grams three times a week if for example they are not 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.409
 special because in day many big fish 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.550
 or for example that of the swordfish 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.680
 apparently it does not have high mercury content and there will not be any is that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.690
 is inside expresses with porta as the neurotoxin 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.270
 interferes with the aunt was lived in the town hall brass steel though 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.900
 It seems strange we do not always look for omega-3 source and bilardo because 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.859
 is in the area 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.139

 also arrests tuna the itu killed low-fat lousy or the sardine is 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.049
 very high and omega 3 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.790
 the width is very high and omega 3 and can consume it with much 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.819
 tranquility because being small fish does not have a high content of 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.709
 mercury not 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.700

 trout 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:53.259
 these fish rich in omega 3 do not occur to them please crashed with pipes 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.639
 it will take temperature because its fatty acids are very sensitive 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.969
 this week to week the consumer is saved so oven 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.920
 i percent anthony that we have on the shelves 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.209
 the subject of folic acid please not important to highlight the method of 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.279
