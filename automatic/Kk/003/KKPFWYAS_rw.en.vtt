00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.730
 automatic light and 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.509
 automatic turn signal means that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 Regarding auto light I don't know 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.560
 as in other cars 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.600
 but here this function is very convenient then 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 there is just no need to know about it and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.289
 remember but if you accidentally turned on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.570
 manual mode you can forget about it 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.510
 and come to her worker 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:39.020
 the car automatically turns on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 three seconds apart is the options 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 discovered by chance and she is very fast 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 corrupted let's say so because when i 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.149
 get on another stranger car I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.539
 I try to do it and there it means like this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.539
 works 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 with a slight touch of your hand you drop a little 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:12.170
 turn signal is not until it clicks and it works 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 somewhere in the 3-4 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.020
 peak or flashing look 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.549
 so that did not work 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.540
 All this is very convenient when rebuilding 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.450
 here 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.450
 just touch the handle 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.799
 and this one is a short interval 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.100
 automatic work indicator they would 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.960
 Of course, manufacturers are a little bigger 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.189
 delay set for this as well 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.189
 the function is very convenient and
