00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
pyramid slow goes looks very nice very

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.599 
pyramid slow goes looks very nice very
high<00:02:44.579> quality<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.609> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
there's a big difference between this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.890 
there's a big difference between this
like<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> contrast<00:02:50.879> between<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.569> this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
like the contrast between this and this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.349 
like the contrast between this and this
on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.030> left<00:02:54.209> side

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
on the one on the one on the left side

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.759 
on the one on the one on the left side
you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.569> see<00:02:54.629> there's<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.140> contrast<00:02:55.590> in

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you can see there's not much contrast in

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.190 
you can see there's not much contrast in
the<00:02:55.799> white<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.459> then<00:02:56.640> here<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.420> lot<00:02:58.109> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
the white but then here it's a lot of

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.619 
the white but then here it's a lot of
contrast<00:02:58.620> looks<00:02:58.859> much<00:02:59.159> better<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.450> also

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
contrast looks much better and it's also

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.990 
contrast looks much better and it's also

super small these ones might be for like
five<00:03:26.129> by<00:03:26.370> five<00:03:26.579> or<00:03:26.790> something<00:03:26.879> maybe<00:03:27.180> six<00:03:27.510> by

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
five by five or something maybe six by

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.800 
five by five or something maybe six by
six<00:03:27.720> these<00:03:28.650> ones<00:03:28.799> might<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.910> four<00:03:31.459> 4<00:03:32.459> by<00:03:32.790> 4<00:03:33.209> or<00:03:33.239> 5

six these ones might be four 4 by 4 or 5

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.589 
six these ones might be four 4 by 4 or 5
m-f<00:03:33.989> i'm<00:03:34.139> not<00:03:34.349> sure<00:03:34.440> i<00:03:34.500> think<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.799> 505<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.609> then

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
m-f i'm not sure i think is 505 and then

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.740 
m-f i'm not sure i think is 505 and then
let's<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.730> there's<00:03:38.730> these<00:03:38.940> ones<00:03:39.269> which<00:03:39.569> are

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
let's see there's these ones which are

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.689 
let's see there's these ones which are
obviously<00:03:40.019> three<00:03:40.530> by<00:03:40.680> threes<00:03:40.919> yeah<00:03:41.129> so<00:03:41.340> these

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
obviously three by threes yeah so these

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.270 
obviously three by threes yeah so these
ones<00:03:42.000> are<00:03:42.150> probably<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:42.989> befores<00:03:43.349> these<00:03:44.040> ones

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
ones are probably for befores these ones

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.250 
ones are probably for befores these ones
are<00:03:44.370> probably<00:03:44.549> 5<00:03:44.879> by<00:03:45.030> 5<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.840> also<00:03:45.989> put

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
are probably 5 by 5 and you can also put

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.740 
are probably 5 by 5 and you can also put
the<00:03:46.379> lone<00:03:46.500> 616<00:03:47.129> so<00:03:48.060> these<00:03:48.239> are<00:03:48.449> three<00:03:48.510> by

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the lone 616 so these are three by

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.170 
the lone 616 so these are three by
threes<00:03:49.019> they<00:03:49.169> look<00:03:49.379> really<00:03:49.650> nice<00:03:49.889> see<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.000> I'll

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
threes they look really nice see so I'll

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.360 
threes they look really nice see so I'll
explain<00:03:52.049> what<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.290> logo<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.650> few<00:03:52.949> looks<00:03:53.160> like

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
explain what the logo a few looks like

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.849 
explain what the logo a few looks like
so<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.150> supposed<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.629> be<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> cube<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.680> a

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
so it's supposed to be a cube that's a

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.460 
so it's supposed to be a cube that's a
paradox<00:03:56.129> cuz<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:57.599> if<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.900> look<00:03:58.049> at<00:03:58.169> it<00:03:58.199> it's

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
paradox cuz like if you look at it it's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.500 
paradox cuz like if you look at it it's
it's<00:03:58.709> an<00:03:58.859> optical<00:03:59.069> illusion<00:03:59.370> it's<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.180> cube

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it's an optical illusion it's the cube

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.330 
it's an optical illusion it's the cube
and<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> better<00:04:01.019> it's<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:02.220> doesn't

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and the better it's like it doesn't

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.039 
and the better it's like it doesn't
really<00:04:02.609> look<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:03.030> cube<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.629> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.870> look

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
really look like a cube like if you look

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
really look like a cube like if you look
at<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.349> look<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.769> way<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:06.000> cube

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
at it look at it this way it's a cube

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.960 
at it look at it this way it's a cube
but<00:04:06.510> then<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.889> second<00:04:08.220> illusion<00:04:08.730> though

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
but then it's the second illusion though

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.199 
but then it's the second illusion though
it's<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.269> paradox<00:04:09.810> cube<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.560> then<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.790> on

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it's like a paradox cube and then the on

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.619 
it's like a paradox cube and then the on
the<00:04:12.329> bottom<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.750> says<00:04:13.079> paradox<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:15.419> font

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
the bottom it says paradox so the font

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.870 
the bottom it says paradox so the font
might<00:04:15.900> be<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.139> bit<00:04:16.320> hard<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.530> understand<00:04:17.099> it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
might be a bit hard to understand it

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
might be a bit hard to understand it
looks<00:04:18.030> really<00:04:18.209> weird<00:04:18.539> but<00:04:18.840> if<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.049> look<00:04:19.140> at<00:04:19.289> it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
looks really weird but if you look at it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.839 
looks really weird but if you look at it
from<00:04:19.469> a<00:04:19.620> distance<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.159> can<00:04:20.310> tell<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.789> this

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
from a distance you can tell it to this

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.540 
from a distance you can tell it to this
paradox<00:04:21.620> kind<00:04:22.620> of

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
paradox kind of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.950 
paradox kind of
okay<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:25.319> these<00:04:26.039> ones<00:04:26.400> are<00:04:26.759> these<00:04:27.419> square

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
okay so and these ones are these square

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.700 
okay so and these ones are these square
ones<00:04:28.169> because<00:04:28.590> they're<00:04:29.009> long<00:04:30.289> so<00:04:31.289> they<00:04:31.319> go<00:04:31.560> on

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
ones because they're long so they go on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.990 
ones because they're long so they go on
the<00:04:31.800> scope<00:04:32.009> I<00:04:32.159> don't<00:04:32.310> have<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> square<00:04:32.789> one

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the scope I don't have a square one

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.379 
the scope I don't have a square one
sadly<00:04:33.870> but<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:35.430> these<00:04:35.699> are<00:04:35.729> great<00:04:36.090> these<00:04:36.240> are
