00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
the sitting and thinking about it we

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.710 
the sitting and thinking about it we
played<00:00:14.770> finals<00:00:15.670> two<00:00:15.910> times<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.420> we<00:00:16.480> played

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
played finals two times and we played

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.499 
played finals two times and we played
semi-finals<00:00:17.410> two<00:00:17.590> times<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.330> other

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
semi-finals two times and the other

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.120 
semi-finals two times and the other
editions<00:00:20.050> we<00:00:20.200> haven't<00:00:20.529> been<00:00:20.650> able<00:00:20.770> to<00:00:20.980> go
