rushing<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.770> map<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.220> usually<00:02:15.760> try<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.090> stay

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
rushing this map I usually try to stay

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
rushing this map I usually try to stay
on<00:02:16.420> top<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> buildings<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.380> don't<00:02:17.530> know<00:02:17.650> why

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
on top of the buildings I don't know why

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.490 
on top of the buildings I don't know why
I<00:02:18.190> could<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> light<00:02:19.870> down<00:02:20.170> near<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I could just be a light down near the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.680 
I could just be a light down near the
ground<00:02:20.680> where<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.250> could<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.580> safer<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
ground where it could be safer but I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.260 
ground where it could be safer but I
just<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:24.100> being<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.760> top<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> building

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
just like being on top of the building

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.040 
just like being on top of the building
six<00:02:25.660> more<00:02:25.840> fun<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.340> there's<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.420> guy<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
kind of got blown up by a framework that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.100 
kind of got blown up by a framework that
just<00:02:30.970> made<00:02:31.120> me<00:02:31.209> start<00:02:31.390> laughing<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.050> know

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
just made me start laughing I don't know

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.520 
just made me start laughing I don't know
why<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.070> funny<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.330> get<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.810> guy<00:02:34.989> go

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
why it is funny and get that guy go

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.880 
why it is funny and get that guy go
upstairs<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.820> up<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.410> point<00:02:38.770> I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
upstairs is get up there at that point I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.660 
upstairs is get up there at that point I
probably<00:02:38.920> should<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.760> got<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.060> bomb<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:40.930> I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
probably should have got the bomb but I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.699 
probably should have got the bomb but I
just<00:02:42.670> left<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.140> speed<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
just left it so going to speed this up a

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.810 
just left it so going to speed this up a
little<00:02:44.799> bit<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:46.860> I'm<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.280> map<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.610> just

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
little bit and I'm on this map I just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.900 
little bit and I'm on this map I just
like<00:02:49.120> being<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.810> roofs<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.890> more<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
like being on the roofs it's more in the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.620 
like being on the roofs it's more in the
open<00:02:52.269> I'm<00:02:52.560> more<00:02:53.560> vulnerable<00:02:54.160> but<00:02:54.489> makes<00:02:55.450> it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
open I'm more vulnerable but makes it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.370 
open I'm more vulnerable but makes it
more<00:02:55.780> exciting<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.320> guess<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:58.019> whenever<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.110> have

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
more exciting I guess so whenever I have

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.600 
more exciting I guess so whenever I have
the<00:02:59.410> bomb<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.280> plant<00:03:00.519> i

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the bomb and I'm going to plant i

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.180 
the bomb and I'm going to plant i
usually<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.030> throw<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> smoke<00:03:01.660> or<00:03:02.049> something

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
usually like throw a smoke or something

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.490 
usually like throw a smoke or something
across<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.400> map<00:03:03.610> because<00:03:04.450> maybe<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
across the map because maybe that the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.949 
across the map because maybe that the
person<00:03:06.010> will<00:03:06.070> hear<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.820> some<00:03:07.360> noise<00:03:07.570> on<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
person will hear like some noise on the

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.810 
person will hear like some noise on the
complete<00:03:08.650> opposite<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.340> map<00:03:09.580> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
complete opposite side of the map and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.810 
complete opposite side of the map and
thanked<00:03:10.780> 0<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:10.989> might<00:03:11.320> be<00:03:11.470> over<00:03:11.650> there<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.760> I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
thanked 0 you might be over there so I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.680 
thanked 0 you might be over there so I
just<00:03:13.090> used<00:03:13.299> as<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> distraction<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:15.690> works

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
just used as a distraction it works

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.500 
just used as a distraction it works
