00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
to go for more for a marine build a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.700 
to go for more for a marine build a
marine<00:03:04.040> build<00:03:04.250> allows<00:03:04.700> him<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:06.440> able<00:03:06.560> to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
marine build allows him to be able to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.800 
marine build allows him to be able to
produce<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.220> lot<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> units<00:03:07.790> not<00:03:08.000> get<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.480> gas

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
produce a lot of units not get that gas

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.080 
produce a lot of units not get that gas
early<00:03:09.290> however<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.280> makes<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.670> much<00:03:10.910> more

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
early however it makes it much more

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.430 
early however it makes it much more
difficult<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.570> try<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.840> take<00:03:12.080> down<00:03:12.110> these

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
difficult to try to take down these

SCV did a little bit of scouting does in
fact<00:03:26.570> see<00:03:26.960> it's<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.320> be<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> three<00:03:27.830> gate

these units and whether or not we can

get a run by here is probably a whole
entire<00:05:27.290> another<00:05:27.740> question<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.460> many<00:05:28.520> bunkers

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
entire another question so many bunkers

Reapers now coming out the truth perhaps
try<00:06:30.440> to<00:06:30.470> join<00:06:30.740> in<00:06:30.920> on<00:06:31.040> that<00:06:31.160> fight<00:06:31.430> but<00:06:31.970> the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
try to join in on that fight but the

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.810 
try to join in on that fight but the
Reapers<00:06:32.420> have<00:06:32.810> a<00:06:32.840> range<00:06:33.200> of<00:06:33.350> 4.5<00:06:34.190> then

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
Reapers have a range of 4.5 then

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.760 
Reapers have a range of 4.5 then
compared<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.480> an<00:06:35.540> instruction<00:06:36.080> being<00:06:36.590> that

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
compared to an instruction being that

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.490 
compared to an instruction being that
has<00:06:36.920> a<00:06:36.950> range<00:06:37.340> of<00:06:37.640> five<00:06:37.940> so<00:06:38.630> those<00:06:38.840> centuries

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
has a range of five so those centuries

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.910 
has a range of five so those centuries
will<00:06:39.650> be<00:06:39.770> able<00:06:40.040> to<00:06:40.130> get<00:06:40.310> off<00:06:40.490> one<00:06:40.820> or<00:06:40.850> two<00:06:41.240> shots

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
will be able to get off one or two shots

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.990 
will be able to get off one or two shots
before<00:06:42.920> the<00:06:43.040> Reaper<00:06:43.340> will<00:06:43.490> be<00:06:43.610> able<00:06:43.730> to<00:06:43.850> get

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
before the Reaper will be able to get

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.360 
before the Reaper will be able to get
into<00:06:44.180> position<00:06:44.630> and<00:06:44.750> that<00:06:45.530> is<00:06:45.710> going<00:06:45.860> to<00:06:45.980> be<00:06:46.100> GG

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
into position and that is going to be GG

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.870 
into position and that is going to be GG
so<00:06:47.060> dimm<00:06:47.300> Muslim<00:06:47.720> loses<00:06:48.230> this<00:06:48.470> game<00:06:48.530> and<00:06:49.100> night
