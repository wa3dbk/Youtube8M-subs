00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.470
 Very rich low calorie salad that 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.140
 I like it a lot and I want to share 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.360
 good for it we just need some 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.460
 chicken breasts and in this case the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.669
 I'm doing with a little bit of oil 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.720
 of sunflower a little white wine and 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:36.079
 aromatic spices like garlic parsley and 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.600
 you know good later for the salad 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.570
 we need half lettuce or according to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.579
 people who are, well, you are seeing 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.629

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.160
 skimmed vinegar sunflower oil 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.949
 liquid and good sweetener 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.769
 the next step is to cut everything in 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.809
 pieces and wash the ingredients in 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.180
 this case washing the lettuce and the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.000
 chopped up 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.790
 the washing the carrot I'm going to cut 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.430
 the trunks also in the breasts 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.460
 of chicken tell you that the carrot the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.560
 you can grate but I in my case do not 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.430
 I have scratched because that is how we will have 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.979
 the feeling of being chewing more and 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.250
 so then to fill them more and good 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.880
 Now let's proceed to mix the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 ingredients 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.509
 good we take our plate 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 and well I'm going to do so you 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.740
 you can do it more delicately 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.170
 since I'm recording with bone what 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.420
 I'm doing with one hand but 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.350
 good the procedure is because well 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.290
 it would be like that and now we mix 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.220
 we take our vinegar 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.220
 and we take it 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.260
 Pretty enough vinegar 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.200
 after 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.980
 we take 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.700
 Oil 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.010
 of sunflower but of sunflower does not remain 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.350
 same and ready we put a little bit is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.350
 you just do not have to miss a lot 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.739
 Now let's go with the liquid sweetener 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.870
 and we are also well I do not know the two so 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.680
 two or three tablespoons really 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 and now we take the skim milk and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.900
 we are also a chorreÃ³n thus more or 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.530

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.530

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.550

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.020
 and when we already have this 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.000
 we mix all the ingredients then 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.410
 with a fork a pair of tweezers 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.410

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.380
 I love it, I 've called it a Chinese salad 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.260

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:53.490
