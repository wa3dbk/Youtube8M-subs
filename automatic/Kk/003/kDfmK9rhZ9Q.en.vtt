00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi everyone today i'm going to tagline 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.610
 strongly do the term icetec be questions 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.530
 about summer or yes some things and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.389
 since summer is now one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 summer vacation and also beautiful 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 again i'll be a good one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.560
 place this tag to do this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.900
 it is already 9 o'clock in the evening is sun 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.820
 then bit goes under so it's not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.230
 bright sun in my face or something 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 the weather is nice and hence 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.609
 that I will ask the tag's questions 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 put Heerlen description so that you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 also can do ok let's just 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 to start 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 would you rather have a house on the beach 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 or have a house by the lake 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.329
 I'd rather be a beach fact house 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.219
 because I think a lot of people share 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 that would also choose because it is beach 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.469
 just nice and on the sand it is nicer 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.690
 then to him more and I don't know I think 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.550
 the sea 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 also just nice so I find one 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 pizza efe both nice though it just out 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.520
 you at the museum 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.010
 yes that already seems hard what your 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 favorite summer hairstyle 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 so how do you prefer to wear your hair 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 summer and my name is just my name 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.320
 so also release in the summer 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.930
 but when I go or go in the jacuzzi 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.780
 swim or I really super super hot 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 then I usually do a high tail 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.280
 so usually just wear my hair like that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 nice and loose you get tanned sooner or later 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 burned sooner well I'll be pretty 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 fast brown actually after i get normal 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.159
 brain but I burn nothing so I get 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 brown faster because I banish you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 ever had a henna tattoo 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.210
 yes i had gran once when i went 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.890
 Canaria go about 4 or 3 years ago 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 I go so let them at table 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 put with a heart 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 and there the land looked very old 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 Men go there 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.150
 no i am doing it again think you have 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.830
 prefer a campfire or swimming in the evening 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.320
 games in the evening but then it must be 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.080
 really nice weather for swimming 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 or the pool should be a little warmer 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.560
 are then normal 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.869
 because they like a campfire 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.759
 sing his songs 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.259
 I don't like that so I think so 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.399
 swimming and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 because in general I find them there 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.060
 busy if you have to choose where you would go 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.800
 want in the summer 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 where would you go i think i am 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.540
 rather in the fall or winter to what 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.670
 sunnier country because then it is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.489
 cold here and warm there and then take advantage 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 so what is it hot here so yes 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.640
 It is not really necessary to go to one 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.720
 warm runner you prefer bikinis 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 tankinis 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 or bathing suits well I am very static 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.549
 red to the tankini is in my opinion 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.630
 something like a bikini but then on 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.610
 each other or something 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.910
 so not really a bathing suit but that 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.380
 They sit together at one oh but i have 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.780
 just prefer a bikini and usually 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.180
 cushion of shirt what is a summer 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.069
 I had to wear makeup not so much 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.989
 makeup and in the summer aneke 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.250
 not at all because I then get it dirty and 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.200
 finds sticky 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 but if I want to do something about makeup 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.650
 i just black eyeliner black mascara 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.180
 just simple and yet a bit 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 staged what was the hottest so far 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.799
 day 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.890
 I think the hottest day was 26 degrees 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.329
 or 25 degrees I don't know painfully 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.519
 is not really become super hot in 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.410
 the Netherlands honey it wasn't going to be 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.320
 I think 26 degrees 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.480
 do you sport his son well I think it is 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.120
 super hot in the summer and I do sports 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.920
 generally not really but it is 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 well so that the kids summer more 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 then moves in the winter because I love me 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.940
 swim so dass also sport and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.209
 another joyce in the summer it is too 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.950
 sports so I do all to sum 'sport it 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.660
 summer but not spill gym 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 so that you ever have one 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.500
 holiday love hole i have never had one 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.810
 I had holiday love, honey 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.760
 that I liked someone on vacation or 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.410
 just to walk out release just like that 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.170
 never really 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.209
 unkind and kind of that we are a bunch 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 I never had that and it went 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.160
 actually not so good idea on vacation 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.290
 most cows live in another country 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.000
 or from a different location far away 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.190
 the netherlands and you have to meet each other here 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.290
 miss and then turn what do you want it 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.920
 like to do as appropriate as I want 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.650
 anyway with roy and my friend to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.150
 duinrell and then also to the pool and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 then to tick nice 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.359
 I do n't want to go to the beach and I want to 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.700
 do a few other cool things 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.470
 but i dont really like that 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120
 do I really have to do that I think so 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.340
 just like i had it all happen 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.990
 do you prefer long or short hair during 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.479
 the summer i want my hair right now 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.570
 grows and I went short hair 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.250
 so avoid anything at all 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.950
 longer you wear makeup when you go 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.880
 beach pool or something else with water 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.340
 so goes 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.380
 no i generally wear let me 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.120
 not so much makeup and snap 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.650
 pool or beach do not go at all 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.900
 For me there is not easy without 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.250
 make up or let go and 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.729
 yes it does affect people a bit 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.310
 day is not there so prefer no makeup 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.600
