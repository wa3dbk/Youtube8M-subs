00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that makes sense but the tap water is a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
that makes sense but the tap water is a

think<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> lot<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> people<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
think a lot of people do it out of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
think a lot of people do it out of
convenience<00:01:20.210> they<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> perhaps<00:01:21.630> because

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
convenience they do it perhaps because

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
convenience they do it perhaps because
there's<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> fear<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.640> purity<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> american

and<00:01:58.590> pretend<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.189> from<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.820> fancy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and pretend like it's from some fancy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
and pretend like it's from some fancy
spring<00:02:00.659> well<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> real<00:02:01.530> question<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
spring well the real question here is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.490 
spring well the real question here is
how<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.610> communicate<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.810> information<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
how to communicate that information to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.649 
how to communicate that information to
the<00:02:04.590> consumer<00:02:04.939> bottled<00:02:05.939> water<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.329> very

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the consumer bottled water is very

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
the consumer bottled water is very
different<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> food<00:02:07.979> product<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.610> very

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
different it's a food product it's very

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.300 
different it's a food product it's very
different<00:02:09.149> than<00:02:09.239> tap<00:02:09.479> water<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.950> believe<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
different than tap water we believe that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.760 
different than tap water we believe that
the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.290 
the
it's<00:02:11.890> appropriate<00:02:12.400> way<00:02:12.490> for<00:02:12.520> consumers<00:02:12.820> to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
it's appropriate way for consumers to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.970 
it's appropriate way for consumers to
get<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.570> information<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.410> contact<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
get that information is to contact the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.830 
get that information is to contact the
company<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.760> contact<00:02:16.240> information

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
company and there is contact information

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.740 
company and there is contact information
on<00:02:16.990> almost<00:02:17.320> every<00:02:18.010> bottled<00:02:18.370> water

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
on almost every bottled water

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.150 
on almost every bottled water
particularly<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.900> phone<00:02:20.110> number<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.920> call

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
particularly a phone number if they call

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.830 
particularly a phone number if they call
the<00:02:21.310> company<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.730> ask<00:02:21.970> for<00:02:22.120> information<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the company and ask for information and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.060 
the company and ask for information and
they<00:02:23.020> don't<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.470> information<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.950> they

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
they don't get the information that they

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.920 
they don't get the information that they
want<00:02:24.400> they<00:02:24.850> should<00:02:25.030> choose<00:02:25.210> another<00:02:25.480> bottle

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
want they should choose another bottle

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.600 
want they should choose another bottle
water<00:02:26.080> brand<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:27.040> an<00:02:27.190> important

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
water brand and that's an important

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.070 
water brand and that's an important
distinction<00:02:27.940> here<00:02:28.240> its<00:02:28.360> consumer<00:02:28.750> choice

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
distinction here its consumer choice

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.040 
distinction here its consumer choice
consumers<00:02:30.040> cannot<00:02:30.400> choose<00:02:30.820> which<00:02:31.150> tap<00:02:31.720> water

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
reason why the tap water systems are

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.240 
reason why the tap water systems are
required<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.170> provide<00:02:38.500> consumer<00:02:39.010> confidence
