okay so after cleaning your board you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.840 
okay so after cleaning your board you
want<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.660> go<00:00:15.780> ahead<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.320> touch<00:00:17.160> your<00:00:17.310> edges<00:00:17.670> up

want to go ahead and touch your edges up
make<00:00:18.600> sure<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.230> don't<00:00:19.350> have<00:00:19.500> any<00:00:19.770> burrs

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
make sure that they don't have any burrs

make sure that they don't have any burrs
or<00:00:20.430> cut<00:00:21.420> marks<00:00:21.750> from<00:00:22.020> rocks<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.710> rails<00:00:23.010> or

anything and you also want to make sure

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.419 
anything and you also want to make sure
it's<00:00:26.460> nice<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.699> smooth<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:29.039> solid

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's nice and smooth and a good solid

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.659 
it's nice and smooth and a good solid
edge<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.210> see<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.470> kids<00:00:31.830> taking<00:00:32.550> their

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
edge I see a lot of kids taking their

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.350 
edge I see a lot of kids taking their
files<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:34.250> completely<00:00:35.250> rolling<00:00:35.850> their<00:00:36.030> edges

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
files and completely rolling their edges

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.619 
files and completely rolling their edges
off<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.899> they're<00:00:37.050> hitting<00:00:37.290> rails<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
off because they're hitting rails and

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
off because they're hitting rails and
you<00:00:39.629> won't<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:40.050> pros<00:00:40.379> doing<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.010> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you won't see pros doing that because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
you won't see pros doing that because
they<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:43.320> sort<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> edge<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.730> dig

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
they still need some sort of edge to dig

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
they still need some sort of edge to dig
into<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> harder<00:00:45.809> snow<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.280> talked

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
into the harder snow so what we talked

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
into the harder snow so what we talked
about<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.510> picture<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.989> being

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
about here if you can picture this being

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.799 
about here if you can picture this being
your<00:00:49.320> base<00:00:49.620> edge<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.120> being<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.420> side

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
your base edge and this being your side

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.830 
your base edge and this being your side
edge<00:00:52.050> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.480> these<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.539> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
edge kind of like this these are just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380 
edge kind of like this these are just
the<00:00:54.960> angles<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.129> bevels<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:57.000> edges

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the angles or the bevels of your edges

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.930 
the angles or the bevels of your edges
that<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> talk<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.590> okay<00:00:59.280> if

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that we're going to talk about okay if

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
that we're going to talk about okay if
you<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> file<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you do if you do take a file and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.570 
you do if you do take a file and
completely<00:01:03.030> round<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.780> edges<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.580> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
completely round your edges off you

whatsoever so that's what we're going to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.609 
whatsoever so that's what we're going to
be<00:01:23.880> talking<00:01:24.119> about<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
be talking about first thing that you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
be talking about first thing that you
want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:28.560> take<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> gummy<00:01:29.250> stone<00:01:29.610> okay

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
want to do is take a gummy stone okay

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
want to do is take a gummy stone okay
and<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.290> pulling<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and you can see I'm pulling it out of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580 
and you can see I'm pulling it out of
the<00:01:32.369> water<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> wet<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the water I just like to use it wet it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
the water I just like to use it wet it
creates<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.400> less<00:01:35.610> friction<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
creates a little less friction and up in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
creates a little less friction and up in
the<00:01:37.380> tip<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.619> tail<00:01:37.950> section<00:01:38.520> where<00:01:38.939> your

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the tip and tail section where your

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
the tip and tail section where your
board<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.810> edge<00:01:39.960> never<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.680> touches<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
board your edge never really touches the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.359 
board your edge never really touches the
snow<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.659> ahead<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.369> take

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
snow you do want to go ahead and take

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.219 
snow you do want to go ahead and take
that<00:01:44.399> off<00:01:44.820> pretty<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.810> call<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that off pretty well we call this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.550 
that off pretty well we call this
detuning<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.369> tip<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.759> tail

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.870 

this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> only<00:01:55.979> place<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.610> board

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this is the only place on your board

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
this is the only place on your board
that<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.539> aggressive<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:59.430> your

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
that you want to be aggressive with your

that you want to be aggressive with your
with<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.329> stones<00:02:00.750> okay<00:02:01.289> up<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.920> area

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
with your stones okay up in this area

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
with your stones okay up in this area
you<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.759> need<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.179> edge<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.020> again

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you don't really need your edge so again

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.219 
you don't really need your edge so again
we're<00:02:04.560> detuning<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.549> soon<00:02:05.789> as<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.659> curve<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
we're detuning as soon as the curve of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
we're detuning as soon as the curve of
your<00:02:07.259> board<00:02:07.649> stops<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:09.000> much<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
your board stops is pretty much when you

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
your board stops is pretty much when you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
want to stop with the detuning of your

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.800 
want to stop with the detuning of your
edges<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.489> I'll<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> same<00:02:15.480> thing

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
edges like so I'll do the same thing

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
edges like so I'll do the same thing
down

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
up here which is the tip and this is

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.880 
up here which is the tip and this is
terry<00:02:24.909> oaxaca<00:02:25.209> sins<00:02:25.480> board<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.019> he

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
terry oaxaca sins board and he

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.740 
terry oaxaca sins board and he
definitely<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.549> very<00:02:27.609> particular<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.599> his

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
definitely is very particular with his

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.929 
definitely is very particular with his
edges<00:02:29.109> he<00:02:29.409> knows<00:02:29.590> exactly<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.400> he<00:02:30.459> likes<00:02:30.760> them

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
edges he knows exactly how he likes them

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.500 
edges he knows exactly how he likes them
to<00:02:31.150> feel<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.890> he<00:02:33.069> definitely<00:02:33.370> never<00:02:34.150> ever

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
to feel and he definitely never ever

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.559 
to feel and he definitely never ever
takes<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.530> file<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.129> rounds<00:02:36.790> his<00:02:36.939> whole<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> job

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
takes a file and rounds his whole a job

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.050 
takes a file and rounds his whole a job
so<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.530> called<00:02:38.769> detuning<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.700> tip<00:02:39.909> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
so that's called detuning the tip and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.470 
so that's called detuning the tip and
tail<00:02:40.269> okay<00:02:41.459> your<00:02:42.459> next<00:02:42.670> step<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.730> making<00:02:46.060> sure

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
tail okay your next step is making sure

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990 
tail okay your next step is making sure
your<00:02:46.780> bottom<00:02:47.200> edge<00:02:47.439> or<00:02:47.889> your<00:02:48.159> base<00:02:48.370> edge<00:02:48.639> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
your bottom edge or your base edge is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.709 
your bottom edge or your base edge is
cleaned<00:02:49.900> up<00:02:50.639> it's<00:02:51.639> called<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.090> bevel<00:02:52.450> here

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
cleaned up it's called the bevel here

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.750 
cleaned up it's called the bevel here
okay<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> what<00:02:53.980> we're<00:02:54.069> going<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.250> do<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.609> we're

going to use a diamond stone right here
for<00:02:57.609> wet<00:02:57.760> diamond<00:02:58.150> stalls<00:02:58.389> I'm<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.409> going<00:02:59.590> to

for wet diamond stalls I'm just going to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.789 
for wet diamond stalls I'm just going to
use<00:02:59.859> it<00:03:00.010> with<00:03:00.189> my<00:03:00.340> hands<00:03:01.209> as<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.629> guide<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.690 

there's<00:03:37.340> your<00:03:37.549> base<00:03:37.760> edge<00:03:38.170> now<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:40.310> your<00:03:40.340> side

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
there's your base edge now for your side

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.170 
there's your base edge now for your side
edge<00:03:41.980> we're<00:03:42.980> not<00:03:43.099> going<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.549> use<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.819> hand

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
edge we're not going to just use a hand

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.020 
edge we're not going to just use a hand
guide<00:03:44.480> we're<00:03:44.930> actually<00:03:45.079> going<00:03:45.379> to<00:03:45.470> use<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:46.030> file

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
guide we're actually going to use a file

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.360 
guide we're actually going to use a file
guide<00:03:47.299> for<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.659> okay<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.859> for<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.099> one

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
guide for this okay this is for a one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.629 
guide for this okay this is for a one
degree<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.750> again<00:03:51.079> on<00:03:51.260> your<00:03:51.409> side<00:03:51.680> edge<00:03:52.010> we're

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
degree so again on your side edge we're

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.759 
degree so again on your side edge we're
going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.819> go<00:03:52.969> one<00:03:53.209> degree<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.689> and<00:03:53.989> on<00:03:54.590> our

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
going to go one degree in and on our

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.830 
going to go one degree in and on our
base<00:03:54.980> edge<00:03:55.250> we're<00:03:55.909> going<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> go<00:03:56.209> at<00:03:56.329> least<00:03:56.359> one

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
base edge we're going to go at least one

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.740 
base edge we're going to go at least one
degree<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.760> maybe<00:03:58.760> two<00:03:59.090> degrees<00:03:59.450> because

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
degree in maybe two degrees because

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.619 
degree in maybe two degrees because
that's<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.919> angle<00:04:01.219> that<00:04:01.400> we<00:04:01.629> don't

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
that's this is the angle that we don't

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.679 
that's this is the angle that we don't
want<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.049> be<00:04:03.139> catching<00:04:03.349> our<00:04:03.650> edges<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.129> ok<00:04:05.120> so

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
want to be catching our edges on ok so

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.860 
want to be catching our edges on ok so
again<00:04:05.919> 122<00:04:06.919> degrees<00:04:07.250> on<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.519> base<00:04:07.700> one<00:04:08.569> degree

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
again 122 degrees on the base one degree

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.409 
again 122 degrees on the base one degree
on<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.049> side<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.489> going<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:10.969> be<00:04:11.120> kind

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
on the side and this is going to be kind

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.649 
on the side and this is going to be kind
of<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.629> bevels<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.169> your<00:04:12.290> angles<00:04:13.419> so<00:04:14.419> again<00:04:14.599> I

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
of the bevels of your angles so again I

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.409 
of the bevels of your angles so again I
put<00:04:14.840> my<00:04:14.959> file<00:04:15.199> into<00:04:15.530> my<00:04:15.650> file<00:04:15.859> guide<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:17.239> is

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
put my file into my file guide this is

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.099 
put my file into my file guide this is
again<00:04:17.659> going<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.900> give<00:04:18.049> me<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.260> one<00:04:18.409> degree<00:04:18.739> I

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
again going to give me the one degree I

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.050 
again going to give me the one degree I
place<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.260> alongside<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.709> edge<00:04:22.039> bases<00:04:22.940> away

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
place it alongside the edge bases away

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.050 
place it alongside the edge bases away
from<00:04:23.449> me<00:04:23.570> very<00:04:24.020> easy<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.470> use<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:25.610> board<00:04:25.909> is<00:04:26.030> in

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
from me very easy to use the board is in

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.850 
from me very easy to use the board is in
a<00:04:26.240> nice<00:04:26.419> vice<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:28.220> pull<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.580> along<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.770> you
