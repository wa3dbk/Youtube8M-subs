hook it onto the end and it dangles I

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.630 
hook it onto the end and it dangles I
used<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.780> clean<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.019> strings<00:02:23.319> after<00:02:23.640> every

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
used to clean the strings after every

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.069 
used to clean the strings after every
time<00:02:24.790> alright<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.569> I'm<00:02:25.629> going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> pre-drill

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
time alright so I'm going to pre-drill

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.920 
time alright so I'm going to pre-drill
the<00:02:26.260> holes<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.849> don't<00:02:28.030> want<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.569> drill

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
the holes if you don't want to drill

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.660 
the holes if you don't want to drill
into<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.379> pool<00:02:29.829> table<00:02:30.189> or<00:02:30.250> whatever<00:02:30.430> you're

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
into the pool table or whatever you're

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.589 
into the pool table or whatever you're
drilling<00:02:30.970> into<00:02:31.769> probably<00:02:32.769> good<00:02:32.920> idea<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
drilling into probably good idea to

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.849 
drilling into probably good idea to
maybe<00:02:34.599> put<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:34.989> book<00:02:35.230> or<00:02:35.409> something<00:02:35.650> underneath

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
maybe put a book or something underneath

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.589 
maybe put a book or something underneath
so<00:02:36.400> if<00:02:36.459> you're<00:02:36.579> gonna<00:02:36.670> drill<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.299> can<00:02:37.329> drill

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
so if you're gonna drill you can drill

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:56.610 
so if you're gonna drill you can drill
them<00:02:37.689> to<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.900> book<00:02:38.189> speed<00:02:39.189> this<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:55.439> a<00:02:56.439> little

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
them to the book speed this up a little

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:18.740 
them to the book speed this up a little
bit<00:02:56.829> here<00:02:57.099> it's<00:02:57.879> called<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.389> countersink<00:02:59.079> bit

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.300 

yeah<00:03:19.750> we'll<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:19.989> get<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.470> screws<00:03:21.069> ready

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
yeah we'll just get that screws ready

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.729 
yeah we'll just get that screws ready
this<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.849> outside<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.629> once<00:03:23.319> again<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.680> said

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
this is the outside so once again I said

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.470 
this is the outside so once again I said
I'm<00:03:23.980> gonna<00:03:24.099> use<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:25.060> shorter<00:03:26.879> ones<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.359> then

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
I'm gonna use the shorter ones and then

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.369 
I'm gonna use the shorter ones and then
on<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.690> inside

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
on the inside

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.059 
on the inside
a<00:03:30.269> little<00:03:31.269> bit<00:03:31.359> longer<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:34.299> right<00:03:35.069> two

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
a little bit longer all right two

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.490 
a little bit longer all right two
settings<00:03:36.459> on<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.730> drill<00:03:36.970> low<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.540> high<00:03:37.690> low

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
settings on the drill low and high low

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.229 
settings on the drill low and high low
gives<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.799> more<00:03:38.979> torque<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.639> makes<00:03:40.150> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
gives you more torque and makes the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:04:02.870 
gives you more torque and makes the
battery<00:03:40.569> last<00:03:40.750> longer

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.500 

solid<00:04:03.880> guitars<00:04:04.870> are<00:04:05.050> not<00:04:05.260> gonna<00:04:05.440> fall<00:04:05.740> now<00:04:06.510> so

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
solid guitars are not gonna fall now so

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.930 
solid guitars are not gonna fall now so
here's<00:04:07.720> my<00:04:07.900> little<00:04:08.080> hook<00:04:08.520> that's<00:04:09.520> gonna<00:04:09.730> go

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
here's my little hook that's gonna go

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.390 
here's my little hook that's gonna go
somewhere<00:04:10.360> over<00:04:10.660> here<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.070> other<00:04:12.130> one

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
somewhere over here and the other one

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.030 
somewhere over here and the other one
over<00:04:12.430> here<00:04:12.610> we<00:04:13.450> grow<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.170> hole<00:04:14.320> on<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.830> side

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
over here we grow the hole on one side

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.310 
over here we grow the hole on one side
and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.490> other<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.910> pre<00:04:16.540> drilled<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> on<00:04:17.080> an

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
and the other I pre drilled it on an

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.560 
and the other I pre drilled it on an
angle<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.860> that<00:04:18.280> they're<00:04:18.670> hanging<00:04:19.090> upward

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
angle so that they're hanging upward

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.790 
angle so that they're hanging upward
like<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:19.840> because<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> price<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
like this because the price of the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.050 
like this because the price of the
guitar<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.130> gonna<00:04:21.370> slowly<00:04:21.610> bring<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:21.970> down

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
guitar is gonna slowly bring it down

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.890 
guitar is gonna slowly bring it down
after<00:04:22.570> time<00:04:22.780> hopefully<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> will<00:04:24.070> practice<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
after time hopefully I will practice and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:48.660 
after time hopefully I will practice and
get<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.470> video<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.690> go<00:04:47.490> zoom<00:04:48.490> in

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
get a video up and there you go zoom in

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.660 
get a video up and there you go zoom in
on<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:49.120> fine<00:04:49.870> detail<00:04:50.320> work<00:04:50.350> here<00:04:50.890> there's<00:04:51.340> the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
on the fine detail work here there's the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.570 
on the fine detail work here there's the
countersink<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:53.110> holes<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.160> corner

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
countersink the holes in the corner

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.690 
countersink the holes in the corner
there's<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:55.000> 30-degree<00:04:55.750> angle<00:04:55.780> on<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.230> edge

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
there's a 30-degree angle on the edge

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.230 
there's a 30-degree angle on the edge
and<00:04:57.700> on<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.300> other<00:04:58.480> end<00:04:59.850> there's<00:05:00.850> just

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240
