00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.170 

can't<00:01:28.210> take<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.570> little<00:01:28.960> bit<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.110> time<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.530> load

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
can't take a little bit of time to load

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.730

unfortunately

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.539 

still<00:01:39.460> loading<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.700> go

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.599 

so<00:01:46.549> first<00:01:46.939> thing<00:01:47.149> first<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:48.340> guess<00:01:49.340> he<00:01:51.340> Sonic<00:01:52.340> is

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
so first thing first I guess he Sonic is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.330 
so first thing first I guess he Sonic is
actually<00:01:53.210> rendering<00:01:53.570> 3d<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.770> background

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
actually rendering 3d and the background

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.950 
actually rendering 3d and the background
and<00:01:55.670> foreground<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:57.320> 2d<00:01:58.420> right<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.659> I'm

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
and foreground is in 2d right now I'm

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.870 
and foreground is in 2d right now I'm
gonna<00:02:00.200> use<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.770> devices<00:02:01.579> motion<00:02:02.119> sensor<00:02:02.539> to

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
gonna use the devices motion sensor to

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.370 
gonna use the devices motion sensor to
move<00:02:04.880> left<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.299> right<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.020> find<00:02:06.289> it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
move left and right because I find it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.949 
move left and right because I find it
look<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.920> lot<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:07.670> easier<00:02:08.269> than<00:02:08.569> using<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
look a lot more easier than using the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.809 
look a lot more easier than using the
on-screen<00:02:09.110> buttons<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.009> anyway<00:02:10.789> frankly<00:02:12.819> you

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
on-screen buttons and anyway frankly you

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.610 
on-screen buttons and anyway frankly you
can't<00:02:14.980> replace<00:02:15.980> real<00:02:16.840> buttons<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.440> type

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
can't replace real buttons for this type

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
can't replace real buttons for this type
of<00:02:18.650> games<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.390> when<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> tap<00:02:21.049> I<00:02:21.380> can't<00:02:21.620> jump<00:02:21.860> so

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
of games and when I tap I can't jump so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.020 
of games and when I tap I can't jump so
let's<00:02:22.819> try<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:24.530> something

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.000 

once<00:02:30.570> again<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.380> bit<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> hawk<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
once again it's a little bit the hawk to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:48.440 
once again it's a little bit the hawk to
play<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.440> shoot<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.490> video<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.150> time

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:03:29.630 

performances<00:02:50.849> good

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.840 

once<00:03:30.640> again<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:32.620> not<00:03:33.010> easy<00:03:33.400> at<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:33.700> to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
once again it's not easy at all to

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:44.990 
once again it's not easy at all to
control<00:03:34.480> your

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.450 

so<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.630> said<00:03:45.990> earlier<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.650> game<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:47.130> a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
so like I said earlier the game is a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.600 
so like I said earlier the game is a
little<00:03:48.030> bit<00:03:48.240> expensive<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:49.130> cost<00:03:50.130> your<00:03:50.340> 6.99

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
little bit expensive but cost your 6.99

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.480 
little bit expensive but cost your 6.99
but<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.470> one<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.650> best<00:03:55.920> looking

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
but this is one of the best looking

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.730 
but this is one of the best looking
games<00:03:56.730> right<00:03:57.060> not<00:03:57.300> one<00:03:57.450> Windows<00:03:57.750> Phone<00:03:57.930> 7<00:04:00.740> only

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
games right not one Windows Phone 7 only

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:15.610 
games right not one Windows Phone 7 only
downside<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.400> really<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.080> controls

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:35.700 

boo

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.890 

so<00:04:36.220> anyway<00:04:36.460> let's<00:04:36.669> go<00:04:36.790> back<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.680> actually<00:04:43.080> try

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
so anyway let's go back and actually try

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.570 
so anyway let's go back and actually try
playing<00:04:46.900> with<00:04:47.229> on-screen<00:04:49.680> buttons<00:04:50.680> let's

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
playing with on-screen buttons let's

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.640 
playing with on-screen buttons let's
change<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.150> cuckoo<00:04:52.509> sorry<00:04:53.020> Chris<00:04:53.350> change
