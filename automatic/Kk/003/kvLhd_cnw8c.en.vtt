00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
these look like by default so page turns

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.100 
these look like by default so page turns
pretty<00:02:49.520> much<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.820> exact<00:02:50.060> same<00:02:50.270> speed<00:02:50.600> you'll

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
pretty much the exact same speed you'll

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.880 
pretty much the exact same speed you'll
see<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.780> onyx<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.959> more<00:02:54.440> seamless

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
see that the onyx is more seamless

see that the onyx is more seamless
whereas<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.060> Kobo<00:02:56.510> will<00:02:56.690> kind<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.989> gray<00:02:57.320> out

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
whereas the Kobo will kind of gray out

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.530 
whereas the Kobo will kind of gray out
with<00:02:57.830> these<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.130> dots<00:02:58.520> everywhere<00:02:59.120> every

the onyx books to find it you can make
highlights<00:03:14.260> highlight<00:03:15.260> add<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> note<00:03:15.920> we'll

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
highlights highlight add a note we'll

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.690 
highlights highlight add a note we'll
take<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:16.670> look<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:16.970> keyboard<00:03:17.150> real<00:03:17.480> quick

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
take a look at the keyboard real quick

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.970 
take a look at the keyboard real quick
so<00:03:19.700> let's<00:03:20.090> do<00:03:20.510> an<00:03:20.660> annotation<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:21.860> this

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
so let's do an annotation and on this

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.490 
so let's do an annotation and on this
one<00:03:22.190> we<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.670> choose<00:03:22.940> note<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.380> is

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
one we have to choose note so this is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.350 
one we have to choose note so this is
what<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> keyboards<00:03:25.070> look<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.670> like<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
what the keyboards look like I like the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.970 
what the keyboards look like I like the
keyboard<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.780> onyx<00:03:27.049> way<00:03:27.320> better<00:03:27.560> not<00:03:27.799> because

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
keyboard and onyx way better not because

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.470 
keyboard and onyx way better not because
there's<00:03:28.280> more<00:03:28.430> screen<00:03:28.670> real<00:03:28.700> estate<00:03:28.940> although

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
there's more screen real estate although

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.810 
there's more screen real estate although
that<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> factor<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:31.130> more<00:03:31.370> defined

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
that is a factor but it's more defined

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.449 
that is a factor but it's more defined
it<00:03:32.480> pops<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.019> looks<00:03:33.440> more<00:03:33.620> three-dimensional

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
it pops it looks more three-dimensional

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.440 
it pops it looks more three-dimensional
whereas<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.360> very<00:03:35.420> bland<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:38.299> is

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
whereas this it's very bland the it is

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
whereas this it's very bland the it is
not<00:03:38.660> natural<00:03:39.230> because<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> keyboard

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
not natural because this is a keyboard

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.729 
not natural because this is a keyboard
you<00:03:40.549> see<00:03:40.730> how<00:03:40.850> they're<00:03:41.000> staggered<00:03:41.330> where<00:03:42.140> for

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you see how they're staggered where for

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.490 
you see how they're staggered where for
example<00:03:42.830> qwe<00:03:43.760> rty<00:03:44.209> doesn't<00:03:44.690> exactly<00:03:44.959> line<00:03:45.350> up

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
example qwe rty doesn't exactly line up

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.190 
example qwe rty doesn't exactly line up
with<00:03:45.620> AST<00:03:46.090> asdf<00:03:47.090> whereas<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.989> almost

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
with AST asdf whereas this is almost

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.570 
with AST asdf whereas this is almost
like<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.440> pure<00:03:48.709> grid<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.370> not<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.519> very

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
like a pure grid so it's not a very

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.009 
like a pure grid so it's not a very
natural<00:03:49.910> way<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.330> type<00:03:52.450> there's<00:03:53.450> no<00:03:53.570> home<00:03:53.690> home

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
natural way to type there's no home home

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.330 
natural way to type there's no home home
button<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.410> either<00:03:54.530> these<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.010> can't<00:03:55.220> go

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
if I've forced it you see did a reflow

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.830 
if I've forced it you see did a reflow
there<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.070> really<00:04:58.400> wanted<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.789> do<00:04:58.880> reflow<00:04:59.300> but

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
there I really wanted to do reflow but

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.200 
there I really wanted to do reflow but
it<00:04:59.960> did<00:05:00.110> one<00:05:00.259> anyways<00:05:00.639> page<00:05:01.639> turns<00:05:01.940> take<00:05:02.180> a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
it did one anyways page turns take a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.390 
it did one anyways page turns take a
very<00:05:02.509> long<00:05:02.750> time<00:05:03.080> right<00:05:03.889> now<00:05:04.009> I<00:05:04.039> think<00:05:04.280> it's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
very long time right now I think it's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.010 
very long time right now I think it's
fitting<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.729> width<00:05:05.180> that's<00:05:05.539> why<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.720> height

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
fitting to width that's why the height

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.930 
fitting to width that's why the height
is<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.169> little<00:05:06.259> strange

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
is a little strange

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.100 
is a little strange
