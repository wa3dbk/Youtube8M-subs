00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 So you have to record this video to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.640
 then I took my used one here 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 That's what he's white on the bottom but 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 It's for you to watch Sunday, you know? 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 how is it a biphasic product? 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 so when you get a makeup remover 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.030
 knows he has one he is a liquid 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 he has here is a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.390
 the other phase despite being the same 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 color are two phases 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 and when you come to failure it gets 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 white boy so okay so how 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.170
 It's because it serves what it's for, right? 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
 basically take the makeup off the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 eyes still softening to the area of ​​the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.629
 eyes despite pretending that sometimes 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.449
 used to take off the makeup of the lips 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 when it is too fixed do not know 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.289
 take advantage to take but it's done 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 for the eyes is so it is not 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.159
 oil has no oil because it is made to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.360
 silicone base 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 so that's why he will not either 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.150
 pull the skin of the eyes and not even 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 clear inside the eye the chance 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.840

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.159
