galaxy's<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.619> success<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.010> could<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> 2k

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
galaxy's for success we could have a 2k

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
galaxy's for success we could have a 2k
resolution<00:00:27.090> screen<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.920> basically

4k video in these four cakes place for

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.600 
4k video in these four cakes place for
KABC<00:00:36.840> means<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.770> four<00:00:38.070> times<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
KABC means like four times the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
KABC means like four times the
resolution<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:39.120> 1080p<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.559> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
resolution of 1080p from what I can on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.630 
resolution of 1080p from what I can on
sound<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.160> 2k<00:00:41.610> display<00:00:42.510> should<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.770> same

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
sound so 2k display should be and same

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
sound so 2k display should be and same
resolution<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.719> assume<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.649> times

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
resolution that's like assume two times

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.689 
resolution that's like assume two times
the<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:48.420> communion<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:50.989> obey<00:00:52.579> let's<00:00:53.579> see

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the this communion of a obey let's see

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
the this communion of a obey let's see
here<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.750> 1080p<00:00:55.500> display<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.640> same

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
here of a 1080p display so the same

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.260 
here of a 1080p display so the same
resolution<00:00:57.270> could<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.489> outs<00:00:59.670> 5<00:01:00.030> from

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
resolution could see on the outs 5 from

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.319 
resolution could see on the outs 5 from
two<00:01:00.539> inches<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.770> bigger

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
two inches they also a little bit bigger

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
two inches they also a little bit bigger
if<00:01:03.329> something<00:01:03.719> likes<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.100> off<00:01:05.250> two

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
if something likes to go up and off two

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
if something likes to go up and off two
inch<00:01:05.820> each<00:01:06.720> time<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> accurate<00:01:07.619> advices<00:01:08.159> they

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
inch each time the accurate advices they

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
inch each time the accurate advices they
did<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.760> their<00:01:08.909> note<00:01:09.090> series<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> for

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
did it with their note series you go for

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.429 
did it with their note series you go for
53<00:01:10.920> inch<00:01:11.100> 5.5<00:01:11.820> inch<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:12.420> I'll<00:01:12.630> 57<00:01:13.320> inch

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
53 inch 5.5 inch and then I'll 57 inch

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.429 
53 inch 5.5 inch and then I'll 57 inch
and<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.430> made<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:14.970> same<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> rs3

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and it made it same with it like the rs3

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.550 
and it made it same with it like the rs3
was<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.830> forward<00:01:17.280> 6<00:01:17.670> inch<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:19.170> fold<00:01:19.439> an

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
was like forward 6 inch and then fold an

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.000 
was like forward 6 inch and then fold an
8<00:01:19.740> inch

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
8 inch

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.040 

let's<00:01:23.010> see<00:01:23.160> here<00:01:23.370> website<00:01:23.790> no<00:01:24.090> formed<00:01:24.690> 8-inch

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
let's see here website no formed 8-inch

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.620 
let's see here website no formed 8-inch
that<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.700> food<00:01:26.700> 8-inch<00:01:27.150> i<00:01:27.300> think<00:01:27.510> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that was the food 8-inch i think that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.680 
that was the food 8-inch i think that
was<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> s3<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.070> went<00:01:29.220> s4<00:01:30.120> cottage

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
was the s3 and then they went s4 cottage

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.080 
was the s3 and then they went s4 cottage
and<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.410> maybe<00:01:31.710> hoping<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.250> inch<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> new

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and now maybe hoping to inch on this new

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.820 
and now maybe hoping to inch on this new
variant<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:34.050> can<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> main<00:01:34.620> one

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
variant you can see the main one

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.350 
variant you can see the main one
flexible<00:01:35.280> Virginia<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.210> also

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
flexible Virginia because it's also

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.700 
flexible Virginia because it's also
great<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.660> these<00:01:36.930> rumors<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> sounds<00:01:37.620> we

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
great for these rumors that sounds we

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.410 
great for these rumors that sounds we
might<00:01:37.890> release<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:38.910> flexible

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
might release more and more flexible

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
might release more and more flexible
smartphones<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.380> new<00:01:40.470> galaxy<00:01:40.860> round

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
smartphones we have the new galaxy round

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.370 
smartphones we have the new galaxy round
right<00:01:41.910> now<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.140> flexible

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
right now that is a little bit flexible

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.580 
right now that is a little bit flexible
as<00:01:43.920> mother<00:01:44.550> rumored<00:01:45.300> specs<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.410> nothing

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
as mother rumored specs is it's nothing

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
on 880 205 Snapdragon 800 is already in

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.820 
on 880 205 Snapdragon 800 is already in
a<00:01:50.340> three<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.970> would<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.300> boring<00:01:51.870> 805<00:01:52.620> would

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
a three so we would be boring 805 would

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.350 
a three so we would be boring 805 would
be<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.010> little<00:01:53.160> more<00:01:53.310> interesting<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.180> also

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
be a little more interesting and also

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.710 
be a little more interesting and also
maybe<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.780> drew<00:01:55.020> 400<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.760> are<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.970> everyone<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.480> 3

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
maybe I drew 400 we are on everyone to 3

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.410
