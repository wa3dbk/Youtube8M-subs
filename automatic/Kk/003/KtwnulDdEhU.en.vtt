I'll start with the patches if the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.050 
I'll start with the patches if the
patches<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.600> working<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> simply

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
explained in the comments I'll have him
up<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.480> he<00:00:36.600> deserves<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
up here because he deserves that and

up here because he deserves that and
also<00:00:38.989> another<00:00:39.989> reason<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.739> may<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.980> be

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
also another reason that it may not be
