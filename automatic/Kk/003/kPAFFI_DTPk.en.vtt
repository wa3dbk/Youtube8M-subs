for<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:33.980> first<00:03:34.159> time<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.849> we<00:03:35.269> started

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
for the first time and we started

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.119 
for the first time and we started
talking<00:03:35.870> about<00:03:35.930> stuff<00:03:36.379> you<00:03:36.409> know<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.680> found<00:03:36.980> out

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
talking about stuff you know I found out

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.459 
talking about stuff you know I found out
a<00:03:37.159> lot<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.489> things<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.879> I<00:03:37.969> was<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.170> as<00:03:39.349> an

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469 
a lot of things that I was just as an

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.440 
a lot of things that I was just as an
Israeli<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.920> was<00:03:40.129> not<00:03:40.340> aware<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.329> think

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
Israeli I was not aware of so I think

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.479 
Israeli I was not aware of so I think
this<00:03:41.689> is<00:03:41.750> very<00:03:42.019> important<00:03:42.409> just<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:43.250> aware

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
this is very important just to be aware

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.940 
this is very important just to be aware
to<00:03:43.549> hear<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.150> other<00:03:44.269> side<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:45.409> only<00:03:45.620> to

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
to hear the other side and not only to

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.710 
to hear the other side and not only to
you<00:03:46.519> know<00:03:46.639> to<00:03:46.700> lock<00:03:46.939> your<00:03:47.060> stuff<00:03:47.269> in<00:03:47.389> what<00:03:47.510> you

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
used to what worked really well that we

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.089 
used to what worked really well that we
had<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.700> lot<00:03:52.849> of<00:03:53.180> respect<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.439> each<00:03:54.590> other<00:03:54.829> and
