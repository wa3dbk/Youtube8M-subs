paintings in the encaustic paintings and
also<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> books<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:26.390> started<00:00:27.390> using

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
also in the books I started using

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.080 
also in the books I started using
calligraphy<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.160> write<00:00:29.400> handwriting

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
calligraphy and we're write handwriting

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.160 
calligraphy and we're write handwriting
really<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:32.270> after<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> while<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> realized

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
really and then after a while I realized

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470 
really and then after a while I realized
that<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.739> handwriting<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.670> symbols<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that these handwriting was symbols and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.680 
that these handwriting was symbols and
then<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> started<00:00:37.770> using<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.610> paintings<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
then I started using it in paintings and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.470 
then I started using it in paintings and
it<00:00:40.649> became<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> form<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.700> itself<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.360> do

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it became a form in itself to do

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
it became a form in itself to do
abstract<00:00:43.020> paintings<00:00:51.559> everyone<00:00:52.559> sees<00:00:52.920> words

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
in that different way and everyone has a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
in that different way and everyone has a
word<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.860> means<00:00:56.010> something<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.820> them<00:00:57.030> they

England doing printmaking and over time

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.490 
England doing printmaking and over time
I<00:01:13.260> started<00:01:14.070> making<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.670> own<00:01:15.049> creative<00:01:16.049> books

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
basically hand painted books if you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.719 
basically hand painted books if you
think<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> series<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> paintings<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.520> book

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.050 
think of a series of paintings in a book
form<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.689> book<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.170> made<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.460> larger

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
form this book is just made from larger

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.590 
form this book is just made from larger
sheets<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> paper<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.080> write<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
sheets of paper that I write on and I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
sheets of paper that I write on and I
use<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> fairly<00:01:33.140> simple<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> making<00:01:34.500> them

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
use a fairly simple way of making them

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.050 
use a fairly simple way of making them
and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.369> big<00:01:35.640> sheets<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.930> will

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
and I work big sheets and then I will

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
and I work big sheets and then I will
cut<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.470> let<00:01:40.680> many<00:01:40.890> layers<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
cut them up and do let many layers you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
cut them up and do let many layers you
can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.610> there's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.590> over

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
can see there's a be here and it's over

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
can see there's a be here and it's over
another<00:01:44.310> layer<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.820> words<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> definitely

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
another layer of words in a definitely

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.489 
another layer of words in a definitely
different<00:01:46.560> color

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.090 

encaustic<00:01:52.499> is<00:01:52.909> basically<00:01:53.909> its<00:01:54.149> beeswax<00:01:55.100> with

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
encaustic is basically its beeswax with

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.260 
encaustic is basically its beeswax with
a<00:01:56.369> tree<00:01:57.090> resin<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.789> sometimes<00:01:59.789> I<00:01:59.969> use<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
a tree resin in it sometimes I use the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
a tree resin in it sometimes I use the
whole<00:02:00.420> word<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.319> times<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.829> word

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
whole word but a lot of times the word

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
whole word but a lot of times the word
becomes<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.670> abstract<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.569> I<00:02:03.659> tear<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
becomes more abstract because I tear it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:18.280 
becomes more abstract because I tear it
apart<00:02:04.109> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.499> don't<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:05.039> what<00:02:05.249> the<00:02:05.369> word<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.199 

I'm<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.920> interested<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.700> feeling<00:02:20.999> of

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
I'm just interested in a feeling of

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.300 
I'm just interested in a feeling of
words<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.930> feeling<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.379> shapes<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.889> color

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
words the feeling of shapes that color

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.470 
words the feeling of shapes that color
and<00:02:25.069> thinking<00:02:26.069> about<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:26.700> terms<00:02:26.999> of<00:02:27.269> some

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and thinking about it in terms of some

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.309 
and thinking about it in terms of some
ancient<00:02:27.980> manuscript<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:30.569> babies<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.200> the

wall instead of in a book and there's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.379

connections<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:35.159> people<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.849> all<00:02:36.030> ways

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
connections to people in all ways

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.170
