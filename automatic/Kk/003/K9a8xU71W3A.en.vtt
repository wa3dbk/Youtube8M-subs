00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.770
 frequent rains sometimes crossmen itself 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.020
 reduced daylight hours and 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.840
 fallen leaves on the roadway because 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.269
 what we see on the roads now 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.209
 so today let's talk about how 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.749
 recommendations must be followed 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.740
 this time of year 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.750
 so mid-autumn naturally you are still on 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.750
 summer tires but you need to remember 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.800
 characteristic feature of summer 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.140
 tire 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.750
 at temperatures below plus 5 degrees they are 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.390
 other 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 as a result, significantly reduced 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890
 wheel traction ratio 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.860
 dear and then there's rain 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 need to remember that when driving during 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.579
 the rain 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 we donâ€™t see things well 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.370
 is ahead of us and the quality is not blurred 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 it seems to us that no further than it is on 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.280
 in fact, therefore, must necessarily 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.510
 reduce the speed you need 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.810
 be sure to turn on the windshield wipers 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.310
 and don't forget that movement 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.080
 wiper constantly in front 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.690
 eyes too can if katya for attention 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.720
 the driver must turn on 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.470
 abdul glasses so that misting does not 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.270
 closed review 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.870
 also do not forget about 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.740
 the dangers that bears on the roads 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.729
 big water 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.659
 when driving heavy rain brake 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.929
 the pads are constantly running wet 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.140
 environment and as a result if necessary 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.880
 sudden braking the brake pedal can 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.000
 become 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 so I recommend while driving 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.050
 step on the pedal 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.070
 brakes to dry brake 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 pads 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.500
 even more trouble 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.450
 delivers night rain in the dark glare 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 from wet pavement and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.670
 a film of water on the glass watching the driver he 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 movement in the dark is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 itâ€™s generally dangerous to eat 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.380
 heavy rain 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 only about the possibility of such a trip juices 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 better refrain 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.460
 but the driver has no other choice for us 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 need to comply with all measures 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.659
 small speed precautions 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.420
 you need to turn on the fog lights 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 together with the low beam headlights this is what 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.340
 provide him with the best visibility 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.610
 such conditions 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.800
 so if the rain has intensified so much 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.920
 that even the wipers can not cope I 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.610
 I recommend you to stay at 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 curb and wait out 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.760
 because heavy rain never happens 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.700
 long do not forget to include 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.130
 side lights and better driver 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.770
 so that others can see you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.590
 road users motive grave 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.759
 conditions 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.039
 of course what we told you about it 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.049
 you yourself know all but compliance 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.729
 such simple recommendations will make 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.719
 your trip is safer
