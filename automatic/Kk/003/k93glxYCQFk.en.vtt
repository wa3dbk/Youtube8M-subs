00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
packaging I literally just got these

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:39.430 
packaging I literally just got these
like<00:03:20.140> five<00:03:20.350> minutes<00:03:20.530> ago

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.980 

it's<00:03:40.070> got<00:03:40.250> good<00:03:40.400> jumping<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> spine<00:03:41.720> for

it's got good jumping on the spine for
the<00:03:42.050> handle<00:03:42.350> end<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.800> it's<00:03:42.920> got<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.070> really

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the handle end and it's got a really

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920 
the handle end and it's got a really
good<00:03:43.700> secure<00:03:44.120> grip<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.480> think<00:03:44.660> they<00:03:44.750> did<00:03:44.900> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
good secure grip I think they did a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.960 
good secure grip I think they did a
really<00:03:45.140> good<00:03:45.350> job<00:03:45.410> with<00:03:45.680> these<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
really good job with these and the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.340 
really good job with these and the
reason<00:03:47.450> why<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.600> think<00:03:47.780> these<00:03:47.990> are<00:03:48.050> going<00:03:48.290> to

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
reason why I think these are going to

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.260 
reason why I think these are going to
appeal<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.830> lot<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.010> people<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.550> this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
appeal to a lot of people is this

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.880 
appeal to a lot of people is this
because<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:50.960> going<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.140> give<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> very

because it's going to give you a very

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.030 
because it's going to give you a very
good<00:03:52.010> ability<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.730> get<00:03:53.150> budget-priced<00:03:54.040> high

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040
