Hello everyone
World Rubber Market

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.549
Is Yassun
This table tennis Chiebukuro is

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.660
For above rotation stop
And I'm going to do

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.840
Feature of this stop
The Tteyuu normal stop

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.060
I'd be Henkyu under rotation
This time, I'm stop

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.609
I Henkyu above rotation
You will form Tteyuu

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.199
Anyway, because it is
You will shape you poke the surprise of the other party

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.620
Opponent in such form
If you think it's a flick

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.019
Correspondence is late and in a short
Go flying if you rely

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.969
Or over mistakes
To or become chance ball

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.219
Anyway by Tteyuu
For poke a surprise

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.429
You will stop
In particular, this

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.829
Than done in the receive
Opponent has been stopped

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.069
Against ball
When done in doubles top

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:05.030
Especially has the effect
When you say why

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.399
Opponent to a stop
I am down once

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.320
So the next doubles top
It is a little reaction for

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.490
Will be delayed
So more partner

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.079
I come digs before
Because there is a momentum

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.079
When the upper rotation enters there
Since becomes form of ease skip

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.409
Try in the doubles top
You thought that I would like to have

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.499
I do on the rotation stop in
Three point

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.289
Described will
First The first point of

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.030
Is swing way
The racket is in this way

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.770
To direct the plane towards the opponent
Holding and so as to be wiper

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.999
Please to swing
Here is allowed to wiper

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.469
Firmly and Kyu
By I'll rub

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.380
I will put on the rotation
The second point of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.609
As not skip
It is that raise rubbing

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.939
If you now would skip before
Since not stop

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.860
it is possible to suppress the forces as much as possible to skip
I'll add only force rub

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.879
The thing Tteyuu
Here but I'm pretty difficult

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.170
Very important point
Because now come

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.140
Please note
Anyway third point of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.409
Please be early the RBI
Quite stop the Tteyuu is

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.700
It is a fast technique of RBI
When delayed here

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.379
The time to correspond to the other party
Since giving would

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.709
Through the early RBI
Effect goes up

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.260
Also, when would slow down the RBI
Flew the ball

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.409
Since it away you
Is stopped well short

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.840
Be made to two bound
Difficult is you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.730
If it is almost the distance to the net
Firmly momentum

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.540
Only'll kill
To more than two-bound

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.689
It will be to stop
Anyway RBI is

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.689
Please do do early
Through the practice of this

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.510
Effect of the game
I of course

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.590
Through the practice of this
Soft touch that can not skipped

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.079
To yourself for Tteyuu
It is possible to learn

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.200
therefore certainly can remember
In earnest Gachigachi

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.030
Even without practice
Because good even play sensation

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.150
I think that the Na want to try
So the play

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.890
Please see
