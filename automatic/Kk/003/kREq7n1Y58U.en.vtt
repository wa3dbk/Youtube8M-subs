00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.800
 taking a mouthpiece on the wide part 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.740
 down we start to form long to 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.740
 first we make the cocoon 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.220
 doing a full turn 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.730
 about the union we started making a 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.730
 petal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.329
 we calculate to get 3 to give us the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.019
 turn in that first petal 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.859
 now in the unions I start to give him the 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.859
 another turn 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.360
 here we could leave it as buttons 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.280
 pink 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 when combined with the white we start 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.380
 covering the union with another petal 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 here it is already opening 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 and so we would have a medium rose 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.280
 combined 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.800
 when it is dry it can be removed from 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 paper 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.120
 let's now do it with the mouthpiece 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.120
 bigger with the 104 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.759
 we take the first round 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.759
 and we make the three following petals 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 and the size is more appreciated 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.879
 we started making petals covering the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.879
 union of the previous 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.960
 here the button is a little more open and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.000
 now with the white between the unions of 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.780
 the previous ones we make the petals 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.780
 following 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.410
 if we want it to be more open or more 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.110
 big we continue making the petals 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.110
 always covering the previous unions 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.210
 here we can drop it a little to 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.210
 that looks more open 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.160
 and depending how big or so 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.690
 open you want the rose likewise let's go 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.690
 making more petals 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.019
 according to the size we have the button 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.539
 button already a little open this looks like 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.740
 a small rose and this one already looks like 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.740
 a bigger rose
