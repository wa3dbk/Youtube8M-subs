00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.790
 known what it is and what do you expect to touch it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.030
 as of tomorrow it was 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.530
 well very well because it is a good 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.840

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.900

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.200

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
 and now he said and suddenly 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.439
 for this concentration I come to love me 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.270
 contingency but I thought I wanted 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.670
 fight in amateur tournaments if you endure the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.009

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.320

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.299

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.850

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.860
