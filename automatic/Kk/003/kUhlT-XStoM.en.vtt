horrible and you'll be able to see

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:31.060 
horrible and you'll be able to see
really<00:04:21.019> badly<00:04:21.380> as<00:04:21.680> well<00:04:21.890> where<00:04:22.100> they<00:04:22.130> are

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.920 

me<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:31.820> my<00:04:31.940> client<00:04:32.450> decided<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.500> we'd<00:04:33.890> do<00:04:34.460> a

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
me and my client decided that we'd do a

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.320 
me and my client decided that we'd do a
pastel<00:04:35.930> purple<00:04:36.910> with<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.650> hostile<00:04:39.650> pink

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
pastel purple with a hostile pink

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.500 
pastel purple with a hostile pink
pigment<00:04:41.330> in<00:04:42.050> an<00:04:42.320> ombre<00:04:42.800> because<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.820> didn't

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
pigment in an ombre because I didn't

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.660 
pigment in an ombre because I didn't
want<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.660> do<00:04:44.840> colored<00:04:45.350> acrylic<00:04:45.500> because<00:04:46.430> I

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
want to do colored acrylic because I

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.090 
want to do colored acrylic because I
find<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.480> such<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.750> hostile<00:04:48.320> just<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.770> foil<00:04:49.070> it

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
find it such a hostile just to foil it

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.270 
find it such a hostile just to foil it
all<00:04:49.370> off<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.880> then<00:04:50.060> start<00:04:50.450> again<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.020> just

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
all off and then start again and it just

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.710 
all off and then start again and it just
takes<00:04:52.280> forever<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.180> way<00:04:53.390> was<00:04:53.570> the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
takes forever so this way was the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.340 
takes forever so this way was the
easiest<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.470> quickest<00:04:54.890> way<00:04:55.270> because

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
easiest in the quickest way because

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.310 
easiest in the quickest way because
that's<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.470> way<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:57.800> wanted<00:04:58.100> it<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.110> we<00:05:00.110> went

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
that's the way we wanted it so we went

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.940 
that's the way we wanted it so we went
in<00:05:00.560> with<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:00.950> purple<00:05:01.790> polish<00:05:02.110> we<00:05:03.110> did<00:05:03.350> three

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
in with the purple polish we did three

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.150 
in with the purple polish we did three
layers<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.640> then<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:05.390> cured<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.170> then

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
layers and then we cured it and then

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.970 
layers and then we cured it and then
with<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.330> tacky<00:05:08.630> layer<00:05:08.960> or<00:05:09.320> push<00:05:09.710> the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
with the tacky layer or push the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.490 
with the tacky layer or push the
pigments<00:05:10.580> into<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.510> tip<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:12.020> nail<00:05:12.200> and

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
pigments into the tip of the nail and

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.770 
pigments into the tip of the nail and
then<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:13.430> brushed<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.880> up<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.090> nail<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.540> it<00:05:14.600> gave

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
then I brushed it up the nail so it gave

00:05:14.780 --> 00:06:08.140 
then I brushed it up the nail so it gave
