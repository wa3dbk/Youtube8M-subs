 the theme galaxies for mini like her 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 Example of a stop for mac computer 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 eg spot the flash or other or 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.390
 and you just want to go back to that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.189
 stock or you a deo dagsay never 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 then this is the right video 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.130
 for you the whole will be wired 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.849
 installed the whole is around 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 900 megawatt large short Gigabyte 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.640
 this is an alternative to, so to speak 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 Red now tell you so about that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.879
 We have to make it all the way up 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.010
 buttons off home button and power button 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.039
 to press 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 the x is excessive when the blue 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.420
 text above 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 so now we have hats and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:04.760
 installed that went to data factor 3 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 user tasks partitioned cash strapped 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 to the promise dk german form is ik 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.630
 1 that is now the jazz ev sdk is the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 internal store and tourist is 1 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.490
 the sd card that makes me in here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.799
 have the whole on sd card 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 Now I'm going to roma the odeg 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:31.350
 drummer darabos s family style and now 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.930
 leather that are once through that can 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 say a little while 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 Let's look at the form the room is on 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 base of 42 is of course very good 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 as there are a few additional features 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.610
 machines holler hollo launcher that was 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.020
 then also sp base and otherwise the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.210
 kids remain the same as far has 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.040
 sweats the whole thing is in the dx, so to speak 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.180
 format as already said when we do not order 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 duplicate files in the system 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 what else can you update that? 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.590
 not so far as I know because we are one 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.119
 in it and once the changed 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.170
 system files he'll get you right out 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.880
 throw that is not often that goes 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.620
 whole three to four minutes I think 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.010
 maybe even a bit 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.870
 faster, I do not know exactly 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:28.140
 the mini takes a bit longer 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:32.019
 That's how it should be 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.849
 maybe still will be 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.380
 a few sp mini videos will come then 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.760
 The device will disappear again because 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.920
 It just does not do so many things for 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.640
 this device gives 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 maybe I'll do some more 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.950
 zammer videos or anything else I was 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.769
 then I'll see I have the device 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.590
 ever had and the flash process 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.730
 will be ready soon 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.459
 I hope it was therefore not surprised 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.760
 if that really long flash because of it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.620
 is a city as I said 900 megawatts 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.100
 that always takes a bit or a bit 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:14.519
 little until the whole thing starts up or 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.519
 flash 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.569
 come on 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.980
 So it can of course be a bit of a challenge for you 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.810
 faster according to the internal 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.980
 memory that I have that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 faster but I have that on the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.130
 sd it takes a little while 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.130
 but you have good but well 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.599
 if yours does not come after him 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.209
 you should start again 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.010
 election program so if not start up 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 should still be a train on 8 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.379
 update and then the device should 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.090
 start up as I said not surprised that 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.600
 it then starts up longer as I said 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.910
 already two or a minute ago it drives 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.220
 Three to four minutes high at Miami 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.240
 that takes a little longer 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.770
 I see something nice there 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.639
 loading work that moves there that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.320
 means it is finished now have now 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.660
 make different selection options 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.180
 press home button to make way but 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.470
 how to party back button and go 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:47.060
 also for system and leave the whole 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.060
 The device was always high for mini 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.430
 so boot up all the load 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.960
 I wanted not only movies now 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.550
 kill three more minutes for 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.919
 So you like to copy one video 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.990
 main channel look in the description 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.250
 the hecking team is waiting for you 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.270
 These are very many things again 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.009
 Read about it for four for example 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.159
 or probably even the mini sp 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.710
 tattoo and other devices the 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.389
 actually very well known are usually 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.490
 just the description on and 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.330
 open the link and then I would 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.330
 say next time
