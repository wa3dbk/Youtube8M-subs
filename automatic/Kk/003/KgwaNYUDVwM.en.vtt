00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.130
 so hello everyone and you are on the channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.720
 abarth r2 and immediately go positive 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
 news on my channel finally appeared 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 first thousand followers thank you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 that you selected my channel and subscribed 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 on him 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 I will try to do my video 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 more often but not yet that's all 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 same today monday 9 march tomorrow 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 all at work for someone to study and at least 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 one o'clock in the evening I decided 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 make a video video count now 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.180
 it is quite relevant and useful 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.040
 This is the choice of computer in terms of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 virtually a crisis and not for anyone not 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.770
 the secret is that now in Russia the dollar 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.899
 already 62-64 rubles, respectively 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.500
 because of this, the cost of iron is strongly 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.570
 rose and collect yourself a good gaming 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.719
 computer on the report on the price has become very 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 it's hard not to speculate on this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.359
 someone is trying to cheat like this 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.489
 for example in this video a company of braces here 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.189
 and I will try to help you make sure 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.770
 selection of components 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.689
 so that you save and get 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 maximum benefit from this iron and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.810
 so let's start the first this is the processor 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 intel i3 4160 mash is 36 hertz two cores 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 four threads good processor for gaming 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.470
 I want to immediately say why not md 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.900
 why not 86 i egor and so on because 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 that most games did n't care about 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 number uncle 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.420
 Inga is more important is the performance 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.689
 on the core and the performance on and draw 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 in the love is always above at least 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.040
 last year and that's why 36 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.710
 gigahertz with two cores a and 3 for a little 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.299
 not the latest generation 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.189
 gain compared to and in b6 300 and fx 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.759
 8320 if we are talking about overclocking then 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.530
 Of course 4160 you especially do not overclock andr 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.689
 in principle possible but you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.689
 do not have to save on the system 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.229
 cooling how we do it now 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.080
 CPU cooler 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.019
 theta deepcool 25,390 rubles this 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.250
 principle is not very expensive but such 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.180
 cooler can with easily 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.480
 more than cool this pretty not 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 I know 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.819
 cold percent like in the elite 3 4161 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.700
 54 watts only deepcool theta 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.640
 cool it easy and simple price tag when 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.709
 it is small and it is plus operational 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.250
 memory will have to take two dies almost 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.840
 gigabyte and so unix original i think 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.610
 only regina chemistry you need to take either 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.579
 samsung original because this is the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.190
 reliable memory and reliability, I think 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.690
 much more important 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.120
 appearance which happens at accelerating 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.239
 Of course, memory could have been a little bit 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 save on memory and simpler but i'm so 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.989
 don't do frequency here 1806 6 megahertz 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.480
 standard 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.750
 this is very cool this is really fast 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.599
 memory case body we have cheap 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.140
 because so understand we need 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.629
 save 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.250
 buy a separate building for 3000 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.319
 still as much power supply we just 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.989
 can not afford if you can 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.220
 buy but i choose 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.019
 such a casing and so seagate its 7203 with 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.380
 nana sea ​​some kind of power supply on 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.620
 500 watts but even 500 watts stretched out 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.120
 configuration with a good margin 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.950
 body principle with a good system 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.579
 cooling see very large 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.950
 120mm ventilation amount 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.319
 rear ventilation is the same 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.880
 the lattice is on two coolers 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.510
 almost any 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.239
 graphics cards that is basically the case 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.980
 more than acceptable to our system 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.440
 motherboard came accounted for 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.260
 save not from x and matrix 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.440
 but with full sound with all the right ones 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.609
 connectors and other 3320 rubles asrock 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.790
 h81 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.000
 m fee is very decent for my money I 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.280
 I think this is one of the best choices. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.919
 we have a hybrid hard drive 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.890
 and hard drive ssd ssd true all 8 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.870
 gigabyte and what it will give us literally 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.990
 after a week and a half use 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.470
 your computer hard drive will understand 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.780
 what files do we use more often and these 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 files will pass through ssd and 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.139
 it will give a positive effect in terms of 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.260
 operating speed itself 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.990
 systems of course you can save buy 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.370
 My hard drive is simpler, but I think 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.510
 this one is the best choice for 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.530
 good computer regards video card 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.220
 This is our gtx 960 have disappeared by what 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.870
 the video card is good in many tests 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.320
 references will be below in the description of the video 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.780
 in expand this description see everything 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.889
 this video card is pretty powerful 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.570
 comparable to 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.039
 r9 280x 280x 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.419
 sometimes of course does not lose sometimes 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 wins them on average has parity 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.419
 the cost of the video card is cheaper 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.350
 than we are 280x 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.419
 and sometimes even cheaper than 280 is 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.789
 by the way one of the most inexpensive versions 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.760
 wait for 960 and then basically you can 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.070
 save on cool cooling because 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.330
 that this video card has a very low 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.280
 heat dissipation accordingly 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.099
 power consumption ie graphics cards in 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.080
 this plan is very good to have at least 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.099
 two gigabytes of video memory but in many 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.440
 games this will be enough in length 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.460
 the graphics card is all 210 millimeters of this 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.210
 enough for our corps on all 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.949
 characteristics everything is fine that we have from 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.580
 we get it out of it we get 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.900
 36 thousand three hundred forty rubles for the system 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.190
 if we want to save 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.780
 what we do we buy r9 280x and 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.810
 gaming will save about 600 rubles 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.470
 the video card will be the same level as r9 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.919
 960 as the same type of cooling system is very 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.900
 even decent I cost a little lower 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:23.380
 here is 3 gigabytes of memory which is 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.730
 my understanding of the advantage here on this tsiferku 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.500
 you can not even pay attention to it 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.180
 complete nonsense 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.360
 sizes a bit bigger but our case 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.700
 holds the hard drive the biggest 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.710
 savings it vs digital there were in the series 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.470
 this is already a normal hard drive and saving 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.630
 about one and a half thousand rubles 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.669
 config with him by the way will have the config 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.070
 her again in the description of the video, see them 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.400
 in the same place cost thirty four thousand 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.690
 three hundred and sixty rubles as you can 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.660
 reduce the cost of this config 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.970
 Of course, you can still put the motherboard 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.580
 easier to save 500 rubles, I think 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.570
 it is uncritical 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.080
 RAM you can take the horse again 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:06.490
 kingston save with both slats yet 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.620
 a couple of hundred rubles in principle 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:13.510
 no more savings here 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.970
 do all say something goes on 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.919
 some such deeper changes 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.930
 it will already concern your other 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.590
 topics and let's say it will need a case 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.410
 another video and most likely they will be in 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.419
 The first will be a video for a very budget 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.789
 computer gaming now 25 thousand 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.700
 rubles it is very budget and this video 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:36.280
 will and will also be a video about some 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.250
 more expensive sistemnik I bye 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.729
 I think about what the price will be 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.669
 you can offer yours in this video 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:50.260
 the price you think is the most 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:51.850
 interestingly say 45,000 50-60 thousand here 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.710
 what will be interesting to you just write in 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.100
 comments i read your comments 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:00.400
 and after the video about the computer for 25,000 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:04.720
 rubles, I will make a video that pick up 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:08.740
 seek the greatest interest from the audience here 

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.080
 on this I want to finish this video thanks 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.870
 for watching this video thanks 

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.919
 subscribe to my channel like and 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.919
 bye everyone
