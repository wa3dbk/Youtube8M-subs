00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 in the center you can place more in the front of the car and the trunk can 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.180
 have more space this is the basic idea because this is easier for 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.590
 we use this car in england and france there are no problems the 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.919
 driver is in the center 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.919
 steering wheel to the right or to the left does not matter 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.069
 Beijing EFE made a car for everyone 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.619
 the cost of cadiz can vary from 7 thousand dollars to one of four 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.749
 cylinders up to 25 thousand dollars for a family car p 6 cylinders 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.580
 negre's determination to be environmentally responsible is also 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.750
 extends to manufacturing 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.220
 we are going to expand the industrial concept with which we started which is to manufacture 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.340
 cars in small factories located in the market 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 It is an original concept 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.480
 it is very important for the economy 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 for society the issue of pollution 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.150
 the compressed air car works 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.450
 Now all that Kylie needs is the support of the public and the industry 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 automotive 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.380
 the advances are always difficult and especially the technological advances 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.730
 because it's the industry generally follows an established direction 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.570
 and they do not like to see someone change the course but today there is a need 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 world for changing the course 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 there is also a worldwide need for pure water 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.399
 luckily we can turn contaminated water into something drinkable 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
 but this costs us millions 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 listen to the particular sound of this solution to pollution 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 it's a car that works with compressed air 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.580
 it's called letters 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.260
 hotel did not have compressed air 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.650
 is the result of 14 years of research and development of the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.180
 French engine designer 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.519
 limit 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.609
 with the cat 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.819
 Messi created a car that produced followed in missions 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.800
 the premise of this project was 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.040
 To run a car, especially in the city, little energy is needed 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.170
 With compressed air you can accumulate enough energy to do it 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.939
 compressed air has long been used as a source of energy for 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.049
 numerous tools and equipment 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.670
 for car designers compressed air became difficult and take advantage 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.429
 but now Miter and his team in the national increase engine built a 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 engine that they believe will revolutionize the market 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.359
 inside a combustion engine gasoline and oxygen are 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.829
 they ignite two resulting explosions create pressure which pushes the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.759
 pistons that rotate the crankshaft 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.229
 with the negre motor 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.699
 Accurately calculated air exclusions create the 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.929
 pressure needed to run the pistons without contaminating 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.659
 providing enough energy to operate the car requires a 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.109
 pressure of 4 thousand 300 pounds per square inch 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.109
 those more than 100 times the tire pressure of a car 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.589
 force the air inside a tank so small as to fit under the 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.589
 Cat's chassis is a potential time bomb 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.379
 the designers took on the challenge of building a tank that would not explode 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.790
 here we see the technology inside the car can see that under the floor 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 we have some carbon fiber tanks should be used carbon fiber 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.779
 the cars because it's very safe 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.499
 if there is a shock there will be no problems with the dispersion of the pieces there only 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.499
 a crack and air escape 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.670
 the tanks 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.670
 can even withstand the impact of a small caliber weapon 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.709
 Since it works with air the cat has a lightweight aluminum chassis for 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.129
 keep it slim and agile 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.049
 the same care is taken for the bodywork 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.980
 the body of the car is made with fiberglass 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.900
 Using fiberglass is very important for us because the car 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 will be lighter and having a light car we will have greater autonomy 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.699
 our technology does not store much energy so we have to achieve a 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.439
 greater autonomy with this amount 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.830
 the company of l'ebre 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.750
 gave a license to tata motors the largest car manufacturer in india 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.270
 and the city of mexico without three
