00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 with deaf you know it can 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 earn money just place 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.970
 his under not sure a life insurance a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 booklet has by buying shares of

 obligations of these countries brief full of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 placement but with jumps I want 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 say with real coins 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.000
 like this one you can also win 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.189
 money then not with anyone 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 which room of course but with 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.670
 collectibles 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.340
 greet them call the numismatists they 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 are a little over 90000 in France 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
 about and their passion is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.670
 collect coins then they 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 may be old date napoleon 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 Romans or Greeks and we beat them 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.440
 currencies for millennia 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.200
 now we can also have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.870
 pieces just out of the workshops of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.390
 currency of paris then in gold or in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 money they often have more value 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 that if they are nickel and their price 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 can evolve in function and many 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.199
 Gold price of precious materials 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.359
 but what makes the value of a coin 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 in addition to its good state of conservation 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.250
 it's much more its rarity we're going 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.909
 take an example with a piece of the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 money of Paris 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.130
 the taj mahal a kilo of gold which at 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.720
 current price is around 35000 euros 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 must know that it sold there 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 two years one hundred thousand euros 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.659
 so, of course, there were diamonds 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 neighborhood above on the dome of the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.740
 famous Indian mausoleum but especially 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.130
 this work of art was made 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.689
 than 29 copies which explains why 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 largely its value another 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.780
 example a piece of 2 francs can 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 exchanging on the internet hold on well 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 up to 800 euros more than 2500 times his 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.490
 facial value hours not everything 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 no need to search in your 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 wallet your old pieces of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.240
 two fronts it's only the ones that 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.990
 were made in 1991 this year 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.799
 there France in the product that 2500 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 copies 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 there will not be any for all 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 collectors the numismatists can 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
 to have in their hands real 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.509
 fortunes constituted over the years the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.340
 most one must know of these 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.289
 collectors will never sell their 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.879
 collection of their living 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.579
 but history shows that the pieces of 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.189
 currency can also constitute a very 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.049
 good placement as the 5000 pieces 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.420
 euros in gold of the wheel bet you 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.730
 can see 2000 pieces that have 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.549
 sold in just a few hours and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.590
 which will always be worth at least 5000 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.900
 euros the currency of paris that succeeded 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.060
 a nice operation in 2010 with the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.310
 launch of currencies from more regions 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.439
 10 million pieces sold 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.790
 in more than 3,000 post offices then 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.530
 the most sought after one should know that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 it's the 10 euro coin of mayotte 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.510
 sold only on this island not far 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.609
 of madagascar some collectors 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.859
 competed with imagination to be able to 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.959
 get them the case for example from a 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.000
 collective firefighters who did not hesitate 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 to go up all over the national territory 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 a kind of association to exchange 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.579
 pieces the case also I was told 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.099
 of a former constable who furrowed 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.439
 all France to get your hands on 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.810
 the 27 coins issued each year 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.269
 for three years and to know everything 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.099
