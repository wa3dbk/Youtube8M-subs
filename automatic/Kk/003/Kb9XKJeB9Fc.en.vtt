what you brought to the show I think
we've<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> pipeline<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.449> we

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
we've got the pipeline that's right we

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.779 
we've got the pipeline that's right we
got<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> pipeline<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> Fat<00:00:22.590> City<00:00:22.789> those

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
got the pipeline in the Fat City those

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.929 
got the pipeline in the Fat City those
are<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.180> brand<00:00:24.449> new<00:00:24.480> pedals<00:00:25.939> basically

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
are the two brand new pedals basically

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
are the two brand new pedals basically
pipeline<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.869> kind<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> dual<00:00:28.619> purpose<00:00:28.830> pedal

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
pipeline is kind of a dual purpose pedal

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.519 
pipeline is kind of a dual purpose pedal
it's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.490> tremolo<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.900> does<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it's a tremolo but it also does the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
it's a tremolo but it also does the
harmonic<00:00:31.920> vibrato<00:00:32.279> found<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> early

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
harmonic vibrato found on the early

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
harmonic vibrato found on the early
sixties<00:00:34.230> Brown<00:00:35.040> fender<00:00:35.550> amps<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.059> only<00:00:36.210> made

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
sixties Brown fender amps they only made

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
sixties Brown fender amps they only made
them<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> few<00:00:36.870> years<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> really

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
them for a few years and it was a really

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
them for a few years and it was a really
complex<00:00:38.670> tremolo<00:00:39.180> circuit<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:41.660> basically<00:00:42.660> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
complex tremolo circuit and basically we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.830 
complex tremolo circuit and basically we
replicated<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> nine-volt<00:00:44.250> pedal<00:00:44.840> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
replicated that in a nine-volt pedal and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
replicated that in a nine-volt pedal and
it<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.680> cool<00:00:46.950> stereo<00:00:47.309> stuff<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.730> on

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it has some cool stereo stuff going on

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
it has some cool stereo stuff going on
absolutely<00:00:48.629> yeah<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
absolutely yeah you can you can it has a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.580 
absolutely yeah you can you can it has a
mono<00:00:50.489> effect<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.000> also<00:00:51.120> stereo<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
mono effect but also stereo out and in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.400 
mono effect but also stereo out and in
stereo<00:00:53.070> mode<00:00:53.129> it'll<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:53.910> pan<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
stereo mode it'll actually pan the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
stereo mode it'll actually pan the
tremolo<00:00:55.680> back<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> forth<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> harmonic

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
tremolo back and forth or the harmonic

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.610 
tremolo back and forth or the harmonic
Matt<00:00:57.570> brought<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.320> forth<00:00:58.500> between

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
Matt brought it back and forth between

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
Matt brought it back and forth between
two<00:00:59.100> speakers<00:00:59.340> alright<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.510> try

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
two speakers alright now we're gonna try

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
two speakers alright now we're gonna try
to<00:01:00.899> listen<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.920> we're<00:01:02.370> gonna<00:01:02.460> set

to listen to that right we're gonna set

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.990 
to listen to that right we're gonna set
up<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> mic<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
up a mic and see if we can really

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
up a mic and see if we can really
capture<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.810> demonstrating<00:01:07.770> we've<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.040> Tom

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
capture it demonstrating we've got Tom

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.110 

that<00:02:44.830> sounded<00:02:45.130> great<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.400> hope<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.970> comes

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that sounded great I hope it comes

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.020 
that sounded great I hope it comes
across<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:48.100> panning<00:02:48.490> sounds<00:02:48.760> really

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
across but the panning sounds really

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.580 
across but the panning sounds really
great<00:02:49.240> what<00:02:49.480> were<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:50.080> were<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.350> doing

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
great what were you what were you doing

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.480 
great what were you what were you doing
with<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.830> pedal<00:02:51.100> um<00:02:51.280> basically<00:02:53.130> he<00:02:54.130> began

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
with the pedal um basically he began

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.270 
with the pedal um basically he began
with<00:02:54.850> fairly<00:02:55.570> low<00:02:55.780> intensity<00:02:56.320> had<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
with fairly low intensity had the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.140 
with fairly low intensity had the
standard<00:02:57.670> tremolo<00:02:58.180> mode<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.959> stereo<00:02:59.500> and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
standard tremolo mode in stereo and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.449 
standard tremolo mode in stereo and
after<00:03:01.150> about<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.780> know<00:03:02.320> 40<00:03:02.680> 50<00:03:02.770> seconds<00:03:03.190> or<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.430> I

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
after about I know 40 50 seconds or so I

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.890 
after about I know 40 50 seconds or so I
switched<00:03:03.880> over<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.270> harmonic<00:03:04.569> vibrato

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
switched over to the harmonic vibrato

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.770 
switched over to the harmonic vibrato
and<00:03:05.650> that's<00:03:05.980> where<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.060> alternating<00:03:07.570> high

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and that's where the alternating high

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.620 
and that's where the alternating high
and<00:03:07.959> low-pass<00:03:08.230> filters<00:03:08.680> kicked<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and low-pass filters kicked in and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.580 
and low-pass filters kicked in and
obviously<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.810> messing<00:03:11.110> with<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.290> speed<00:03:11.560> a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
obviously it's messing with the speed a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.199 
obviously it's messing with the speed a
little<00:03:11.709> bit<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.250> intensity<00:03:12.700> together

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
little bit and the intensity together

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.930 
little bit and the intensity together
the<00:03:13.600> show<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.019> get<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> very<00:03:14.410> light<00:03:14.940> vibrato

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the show it can get a very light vibrato

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.690 
the show it can get a very light vibrato
or<00:03:16.120> very<00:03:16.660> heavy<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.310> also

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
or very heavy one right now you also

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.550 
or very heavy one right now you also
have<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> sad<00:03:19.120> City<00:03:19.420> look<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.170> know<00:03:20.260> tell<00:03:20.470> us

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
have the sad City look you know tell us

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.990 
have the sad City look you know tell us
about<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.920> little<00:03:21.070> bit<00:03:21.310> absolutely

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
about that a little bit absolutely

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.630 
about that a little bit absolutely
basically<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.050> two<00:03:23.860> independent

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
basically it is two independent

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.350 
basically it is two independent
OverDrive's<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.880> basically<00:03:28.269> we've

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
OverDrive's it is there basically we've

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.210 
OverDrive's it is there basically we've
got<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> one<00:03:28.810> mile<00:03:29.019> two<00:03:29.200> hour<00:03:29.320> drive<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.860> one

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
got a one mile two hour drive and one

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.390 
got a one mile two hour drive and one
fairly<00:03:30.730> heavy<00:03:31.060> Marshall<00:03:31.690> type<00:03:31.870> overdrive

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
fairly heavy Marshall type overdrive

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.560 
fairly heavy Marshall type overdrive
they're<00:03:33.400> independent<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.910> each<00:03:33.970> other<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.300> you

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
they're independent of each other so you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.600 
they're independent of each other so you
can<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:35.019> either<00:03:35.350> one<00:03:35.680> or<00:03:35.980> both<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.430> at<00:03:36.550> the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
can have either one or both on at the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.150 
can have either one or both on at the
same<00:03:36.790> time<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.209> cascade<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:38.709> addition<00:03:39.040> it's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
same time in cascade in addition it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.069 
same time in cascade in addition it's
got<00:03:39.340> an<00:03:39.430> independent<00:03:39.640> boost<00:03:40.239> which<00:03:40.750> can<00:03:40.989> be

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
got an independent boost which can be

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.410 
got an independent boost which can be
switched<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.530> be<00:03:41.650> pre<00:03:41.920> or<00:03:42.220> post<00:03:42.519> overdrive<00:03:43.090> so

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
with a mild overdrive the overdrive -

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.950 
with a mild overdrive the overdrive -
then<00:06:13.730> I<00:06:13.760> switched<00:06:14.030> it<00:06:14.180> off<00:06:14.300> after<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:14.900> few

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
then I switched it off after a few

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.690 
then I switched it off after a few
seconds<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.530> we<00:06:15.680> went<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.920> overdrive<00:06:16.340> number

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
seconds and we went to overdrive number

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.180 
seconds and we went to overdrive number
one<00:06:16.880> which<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.540> heavier<00:06:18.320> more<00:06:18.620> Marshall

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
one which is the heavier more Marshall

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.010 
one which is the heavier more Marshall
type<00:06:19.340> overdrive<00:06:19.790> and<00:06:20.030> then<00:06:20.510> basically<00:06:20.930> I

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
type overdrive and then basically I

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.380 
type overdrive and then basically I
switched<00:06:21.290> on<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.590> second<00:06:21.950> overdrive<00:06:22.390> along

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
switched on the second overdrive along

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.730 
switched on the second overdrive along
with<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.780> first<00:06:23.990> overdrive<00:06:24.410> you<00:06:24.590> got<00:06:24.710> a

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
with the first overdrive you got a

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.370 
with the first overdrive you got a
cascading<00:06:25.310> effect<00:06:25.400> and<00:06:25.910> it<00:06:26.030> ends<00:06:26.540> up<00:06:26.660> getting

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
cascading effect and it ends up getting

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.480 
cascading effect and it ends up getting
a<00:06:28.450> lot<00:06:29.450> of<00:06:29.510> gain<00:06:29.810> but<00:06:30.170> it's<00:06:30.290> oddly<00:06:30.500> defined<00:06:31.130> and

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
a lot of gain but it's oddly defined and

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.660 
a lot of gain but it's oddly defined and
it's<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:31.820> fat<00:06:32.810> city<00:06:33.080> alright<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:33.950> thanks<00:06:34.250> a<00:06:34.280> lot
