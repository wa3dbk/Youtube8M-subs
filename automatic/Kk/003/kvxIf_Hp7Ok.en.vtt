00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
my twisted like that and I pick up

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.969 
my twisted like that and I pick up
another<00:01:01.640> strand<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.789> hair<00:01:03.650> from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> scalp

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
another strand of hair from the scalp

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.719 
another strand of hair from the scalp
and<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:06.000> twist<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:07.010> against<00:01:08.010> each<00:01:08.159> other<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and I twist that against each other and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.109 
and I twist that against each other and
then<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.720> pick<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.080> another<00:01:10.290> strand<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then I pick up another strand and I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.130 
then I pick up another strand and I
twist<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> against<00:01:13.200> each<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:15.140> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
twist that against each other and that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
twist that against each other and that
is<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.630> flat<00:01:18.630> twists<00:01:19.020> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is pretty much how you do flat twists so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.399 
is pretty much how you do flat twists so
I'm<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.500> picking<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.570> twisting<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.200> go

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I'm just picking up and twisting as I go

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.359 
I'm just picking up and twisting as I go
so<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:24.509> picking<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.220> using

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so just picking up and you're only using

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.649 
so just picking up and you're only using
two<00:01:26.820> strands<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.750> three<00:01:28.049> strands

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.020 

the<00:01:35.259> thing<00:01:35.469> I<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:35.829> about<00:01:35.860> flat<00:01:36.430> twist<00:01:36.820> is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the thing I like about flat twist is

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.440 
the thing I like about flat twist is
that<00:01:37.299> flat<00:01:37.689> twist<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.490> easier<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:40.030> scalp

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
that flat twist is easier on the scalp

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.800 
that flat twist is easier on the scalp
and<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:41.649> reduces<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.820> amount<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.210> breakage

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
and it reduces the amount of breakage

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.980 
and it reduces the amount of breakage
you<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.380> unlike<00:01:45.340> with<00:01:45.640> Carlos<00:01:46.210> Carlos<00:01:46.600> it

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
you have unlike with Carlos Carlos it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.590 
you have unlike with Carlos Carlos it
kind<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.289> pulls<00:01:47.649> more<00:01:48.039> on<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.460> scalp<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.090> it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
kind of pulls more on the scalp and it

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.169 
kind of pulls more on the scalp and it
gives<00:01:49.929> you<00:01:50.020> more<00:01:50.229> tension<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.399> flat<00:01:51.700> twist<00:01:52.000> is

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
gives you more tension but flat twist is

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.929 
gives you more tension but flat twist is
much<00:01:52.509> looser<00:01:52.899> so<00:01:53.829> that's<00:01:54.100> how<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.369> do<00:01:54.610> flatter

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
much looser so that's how to do flatter

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.510 
much looser so that's how to do flatter
