00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.920
 hey what is going on people and sincerely 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.750
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.100
 his canal and today you can see 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 call of the ghost gameplay in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 background all year round 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.350
 maps streetside in mode six against 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.220
 six rule there is unfortunately no 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 ground gets if I have a bit 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.779
 pity but now that comes to me anyway 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 soon the new consoles out ps4 xbox 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 one i will definitely go for 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.570
 we try as soon as possible 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.579
 to raise a ps4 because unisex went 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.340
 Six reign on the huge maps 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.620
 that makes really partially so little fun 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 And that is why I am the one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.469
 step document probably now 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 but I will not do it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'll just go back to you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 move because people feel so good 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.469
 not only do i just sleep 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 example I do maybe 30 40 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 kills in the cut or what is 20 kills 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 partially only with the games partially 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 To go for 13 minutes than she would have to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 imagine 20 kills in 2 13 minutes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 that is little more than a child pro 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 minute so every 60 seconds a child 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.990
 that's really really little because I 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 the opponents partly not if 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.439
 I find even one he is behind 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.939
 me and you can also about that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.229
 explain the railway system if you want to know 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.720
 where the opponents are you have to be easy 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.670
 to the right there they will be because 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.439
 Immediately the train system arrives 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 domination, above all, that's total 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 random at black ops 2 are the people 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.829
 nice with the questions of the bond but here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.750
 I'll killed all from behind 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 from the side but I think people that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.930
 is really because of the runways and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 I simply do not have the understanding of the game 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 yet I am frankly honest I am 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.899
 not really good yet 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.189
 player 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.619
 even if the gameplay reasonably in 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.200
 order is 70 kills with specialist and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.340
 Incidentally , I have with six man party 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 played but we did not and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 how to set support with ballistics vests 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 Everyone comes along , and so on 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.189
 played specials believe me and we 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.719
 also all seen this because 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.100
 otherwise it would think so 13 minutes 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.610
 go long but just the best 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 scenes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.660
 I think so five times or so 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.840
 a very cool silence but then 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.040
 always pretty stupid but died 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.019
 yes I think that will not be the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.760
 I was going to be on a canal 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.010
 In any case, improve me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.360
 the games but I think the game 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.470
 It is three days since you can not do so 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.500
 expect a lot 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.140
 many travel already at the beginning or 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.760
 just a few people snap right away 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.290
 at the beginning of class gameplays nils again 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.430
 For example, what I already know 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.980
 has reached is old camp strike camp 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.090
 strike live and so on without shit 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.110
 I made gestures with him 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.480
 we have a little bit already 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.280
 our first impressions just said 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.870
 and yes, I already have so many things 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.799
 addressed the maps yesterday and so on 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 further on are the railway system one too large 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.450
 dies as soon as I come before 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 if all the ups bring one easy 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.620
 can and how do people get that way? 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.590
 mainly when I somehow rule 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.329
 play my game only against german 2 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.579
 has not received a single note today 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:12.560
 lobby at future goss and especially 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.780
 if you kinda party like that 34 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.370
 seeking then one always comes only 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.989
 against parties, the lobby is not against 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.530
 any adams so you play 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.350
 completely against any teams 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.600
 that really excites me on no plan because 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.989
 To a crass gameplay belong just 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.810
 bad opponent is just like that and yes 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.799
 But I think the days today 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.540
 Friday morning Saturday has definitely 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.530
 Now try a little more 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.549
 zocken I have until now never been 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.810
 a lot of playtime and then stop 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.970
 Cashier like to reach 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.019
 to the camps strike in three minutes or 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.160
 That's what I want in any case 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.980
 but I think that will be right 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.599
 difficult to achieve that, but yes 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.139
 we will see something like that the future 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.700
 the gameplay is still going on 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.690
 I think for a minute look 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.880
 maybe I'll do that later 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.040
 tick shorter cut we will see 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.540
 and you could leave the comment 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.239
 Write your first impressions 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.950
 are as I said like you with the game 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.720
 how can you cope? 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.450
 system you already have understanding of the game 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.560
 so I'm still 0 and I know I have 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.049
 Although some and so I think so 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.329
 on my account a 28 he turns it 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.510
 people so it really really great 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.979
 but I do not know is definitely 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.590
 much harder than the other call of 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.550
 Duty black ops two completely around 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.840
 some of it was simply enormous and so was 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.280
 because the maps simply structured 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.050
 The farmer's system was just a lot 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.180
 easier to see through, I say 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
 here it is totally random as I said 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.949
 well yes we will see as I said here 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.150
 Incidentally, I have the demands I am 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.729
 I think I did not bail out 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.979
 not noticed 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.180
 and yes I would say haut rein to 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.410
 to rate next time and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.060
 do not forget to comment, I hope 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.169
 you so the gameplay but fallen as 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.340
 It is actually said today 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.080
 incidentally I just have it running 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.880
 let something on the see 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.600
 background, it is nothing special 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.690
 said and yes there until the next 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.690
 times
