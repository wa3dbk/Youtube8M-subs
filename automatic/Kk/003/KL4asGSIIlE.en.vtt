00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.070 

I<00:00:04.759> think<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.390> efforts<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.670> having<00:00:08.670> us

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
I think that the efforts in having us

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
I think that the efforts in having us
take<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.320> us<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:11.719> piece<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:13.070> what<00:00:14.070> they<00:00:14.280> had<00:00:14.460> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
take with us a piece of what they had to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.160 
take with us a piece of what they had to
teach<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:15.059> excellent<00:00:15.540> they<00:00:15.690> were<00:00:15.870> very

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
teach was excellent they were very

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
teach was excellent they were very
effective<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.800> teaching<00:00:17.070> us<00:00:18.080> not<00:00:19.080> only<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
effective in teaching us not only the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.800 
effective in teaching us not only the
steps<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.090> music<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.660> also

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
steps not only the the music but also

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.939 
steps not only the the music but also
the<00:00:22.050> feeling<00:00:22.380> behind<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:25.260> life<00:00:25.470> drumming

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the feeling behind it the life drumming

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
the feeling behind it the life drumming
that<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.460> Cuban<00:00:26.849> dance<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:28.109> very

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
interesting how intrinsic the dance is
to<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> culture<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:33.329> people<00:00:33.480> are

bored like even though America may be

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
bored like even though America may be
effectively<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.399> everybody<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.860 

there<00:00:51.040> were<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.550> few<00:00:51.760> organizations<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.660> we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
there were a few organizations that we

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.080 
there were a few organizations that we

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
think that most people when they think

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.690 
think that most people when they think
of<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.449> top<00:01:04.750> dance<00:01:05.530> come<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.920> they<00:01:06.040> envision

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
of a top dance come in they envision

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.820 
of a top dance come in they envision
what<00:01:06.880> they<00:01:07.000> think<00:01:07.300> their<00:01:07.990> facilities<00:01:08.680> are

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
what they think their facilities are

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.000 
what they think their facilities are
