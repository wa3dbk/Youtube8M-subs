if you're not the Delta Gundam was

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.870 
if you're not the Delta Gundam was
actually<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> original<00:00:16.650> plan<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> EEA

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
actually the original plan for the EEA

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.820 
actually the original plan for the EEA
akashik<00:00:18.240> II<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.990> scrapped<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.260> they

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
akashik II it was scrapped because they

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.609 
akashik II it was scrapped because they
the<00:00:23.310> transformation<00:00:24.029> idea<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.080> wasn't<00:00:25.260> stable

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the transformation idea it wasn't stable

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.849 
the transformation idea it wasn't stable
at<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.580> guess<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> Gundam

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
at the time I guess in the in the Gundam

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.349 
at the time I guess in the in the Gundam
universe<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.369> didn't<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> technology

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
universe they didn't have the technology

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.849 
universe they didn't have the technology
to<00:00:30.480> pull<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> transformation<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> frame

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to pull off the transformation the frame

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.090 
to pull off the transformation the frame
wasn't<00:00:32.189> stable<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.850> he<00:00:32.940> scrapped<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.100> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
wasn't stable so he scrapped it and and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.370 
wasn't stable so he scrapped it and and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
era you know I mean unicorn era anaheim
electronics<00:00:49.800> dug<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> plans<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.539> made<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
electronics dug up the plans and made a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
electronics dug up the plans and made a
prototype<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.940> as<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
prototype and as you can see this is a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.950 
prototype and as you can see this is a
transformable<00:00:55.440> mobile<00:00:55.530> suit<00:00:55.770> prototype<00:00:56.960> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
transformable mobile suit prototype and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
transformable mobile suit prototype and
they<00:00:58.379> pulled<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:59.039> using<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
they pulled it off by using the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
they pulled it off by using the
transforming<00:01:00.030> technology<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> Delta

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
transforming technology of the Delta

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.240 
transforming technology of the Delta
plus<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> Mobile<00:01:04.530> Suit<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> a

get<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> Delta<00:02:03.430> Gundam<00:02:03.760> Kai<00:02:03.970> as<00:02:04.270> well<00:02:04.510> because

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
get the Delta Gundam Kai as well because

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.280 
get the Delta Gundam Kai as well because
that<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:05.050> my<00:02:05.170> absolute<00:02:05.920> favorite<00:02:05.950> mobile<00:02:06.490> suit

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that is my absolute favorite mobile suit

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290 
that is my absolute favorite mobile suit
but<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:08.590> guess<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.430> Delta<00:02:09.759> got<00:02:09.880> them<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.180> now

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
but I guess the Delta got them for now

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.850 
but I guess the Delta got them for now
can't<00:02:10.810> be<00:02:10.869> my<00:02:11.020> favorite<00:02:11.410> since<00:02:11.620> there's<00:02:11.740> no

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
can't be my favorite since there's no

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.970 
can't be my favorite since there's no

4,200<00:02:46.870> yen<00:02:47.580> yeah<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.810> because<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.950> piece<00:02:51.100> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
4,200 yen yeah it's because the piece is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.770 
4,200 yen yeah it's because the piece is
for<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> most<00:02:51.880> part<00:02:52.110> gold-plated<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.780> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
for the most part gold-plated so that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
for the most part gold-plated so that
kind<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.140> raises<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.560> price<00:02:56.800> quite<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> bit<00:02:57.520> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
kind of raises the price quite a bit and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.690 
kind of raises the price quite a bit and
a<00:02:58.480> lot<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.780> people<00:02:58.990> might<00:02:59.110> think<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.700> 4,200

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
a lot of people might think that 4,200

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.250 
a lot of people might think that 4,200
yen<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.120> pretty<00:03:01.510> unreasonable<00:03:01.780> for

from just cutting off the pieces that's
a<00:03:44.739> big<00:03:44.970> complaint<00:03:45.970> with<00:03:46.239> specially<00:03:47.110> plated

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
a big complaint with specially plated

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.820 
a big complaint with specially plated
kits<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.959> sometimes<00:03:49.959> they're<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.410> under

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
kits is that sometimes they're not under

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.830 
kits is that sometimes they're not under
gated<00:03:51.220> so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
gated so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720 
gated so
that<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:53.650> makes<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.920> big<00:03:53.950> difference<00:03:54.099> in

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
that really makes a big difference in

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.970 
that really makes a big difference in
the<00:03:55.599> total<00:03:56.080> appearance<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.709> can't<00:03:56.890> run

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980

few stickers provided thread parts which

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.280 
few stickers provided thread parts which
is<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.880> little<00:04:25.240> bit<00:04:25.389> disappointed<00:04:26.020> not<00:04:26.110> gonna

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
stopping projects like that that's

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.960 
stopping projects like that that's
really<00:05:32.110> good<00:05:37.050> there's<00:05:38.050> some<00:05:38.170> shocks

transformed all the hand parts color

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.120 
transformed all the hand parts color
guide<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:45.870> this<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.020> nice<00:05:47.290> fold<00:05:47.920> out

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
guide and this is a nice fold out

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.590 
guide and this is a nice fold out
instruction<00:05:48.730> book<00:05:48.970> because<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.570> a

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
instruction book because it is a

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.780

transforming Mobile Suit there has to be

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.400 
transforming Mobile Suit there has to be
extra<00:05:52.210> room<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.450> show<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.750> how<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.960> transform

extra room to show you how to transform

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.200 
extra room to show you how to transform
the<00:05:53.620> thing<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:55.200> yes<00:05:56.200> it<00:05:56.740> is<00:05:56.890> parts<00:05:57.730> former

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the thing and yes it is parts former

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.290 
the thing and yes it is parts former
it's<00:05:58.420> not<00:05:58.600> truly<00:05:59.470> a<00:05:59.680> transforming<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.640> Mobile

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
it's not truly a transforming a Mobile

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.240 
it's not truly a transforming a Mobile
Suit<00:06:01.510> but<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.440> really<00:06:02.560> didn't<00:06:02.920> expect

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
Suit but it really didn't expect

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.790 
Suit but it really didn't expect
anything<00:06:03.550> more<00:06:04.030> than<00:06:04.600> Bart's<00:06:05.020> former<00:06:05.380> really

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
anything more than Bart's former really

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.710 
anything more than Bart's former really
the<00:06:06.220> result<00:06:06.640> was<00:06:06.730> a<00:06:06.760> parts<00:06:07.090> form<00:06:07.300> your<00:06:07.450> Delta

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
the result was a parts form your Delta

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.260 
the result was a parts form your Delta
plus<00:06:07.960> they<00:06:08.860> were<00:06:08.920> all<00:06:09.040> parts<00:06:09.370> formulas<00:06:09.790> so<00:06:10.000> I

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
plus they were all parts formulas so I

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.790 
plus they were all parts formulas so I
didn't<00:06:10.780> really<00:06:10.870> expect<00:06:11.140> anything<00:06:11.410> more<00:06:11.530> than

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
didn't really expect anything more than

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.250 
didn't really expect anything more than
that<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:13.270> that's<00:06:13.420> that<00:06:13.690> as<00:06:13.870> far<00:06:14.050> as<00:06:14.080> the

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
that so that's that as far as the

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.230 
that so that's that as far as the
unboxing<00:06:14.800> I'm<00:06:15.460> just<00:06:15.610> gonna<00:06:15.700> crack<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.090> open

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
unboxing I'm just gonna crack this open

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.200 
unboxing I'm just gonna crack this open
