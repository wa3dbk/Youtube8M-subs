except for the fact that's got a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
except for the fact that's got a
cylindrical<00:00:47.399> lens<00:00:47.789> instead<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> spherical

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
lens now with a cylindrical lens it just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.150 
lens now with a cylindrical lens it just
curves<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.440> goggle<00:00:52.739> unlike<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
curves around the goggle unlike a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
curves around the goggle unlike a
spherical<00:00:53.730> lens<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.090> curves<00:00:54.360> down<00:00:54.660> and

spherical lens which curves down and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.240 
spherical lens which curves down and
around<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> idea<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.980> cylindrical<00:00:58.980> lens

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
