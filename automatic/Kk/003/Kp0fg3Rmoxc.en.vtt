a lot of sound decoders they to get
everything<00:02:01.140> speed<00:02:01.560> match<00:02:01.770> together<00:02:02.280> requires

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
everything speed match together requires

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.660 
everything speed match together requires
the<00:02:03.210> same<00:02:03.390> motor<00:02:03.719> pull<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:05.310> an<00:02:05.490> option

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the same motor pull so that's an option

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.230 
the same motor pull so that's an option
to<00:02:06.030> visit<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:07.079> shares<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.160> asking<00:02:08.759> 45

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
to visit it shares that with asking 45
