Mary<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.710> have<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.890> good<00:00:48.820> look<00:00:49.120> at<00:00:49.360> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.390 

okay<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.910> sheet<00:01:03.150> comes<00:01:03.540> in<00:01:03.930> both<00:01:04.589> leather<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
okay the sheet comes in both leather and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.610 
okay the sheet comes in both leather and
plastic<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> chose<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.840> plastic<00:01:07.260> one

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.100 

because<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.920> blade<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.250> carbon<00:01:12.000> steel<00:01:12.390> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
because the blade is carbon steel so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.540 
because the blade is carbon steel so
with<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> leather<00:01:14.250> leather<00:01:14.760> sheet<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:17.340> only

blade<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.000> rust<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
blade is going to rust but with the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.390 
blade is going to rust but with the
plastic<00:01:26.160> sheet<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.600> water<00:01:28.070> gets<00:01:29.070> out

plastic sheet and all the water gets out

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.990 
plastic sheet and all the water gets out
down<00:01:29.940> here<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:33.630> better<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.440> knife

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.709 
often but but I used it it's perfect to
splint<00:03:35.909> would<00:03:36.349> cut<00:03:37.349> down<00:03:37.819> small<00:03:38.819> trees<00:03:38.849> and

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:39.719 
splint would cut down small trees and

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.959 
splint would cut down small trees and
stuff<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.409> that

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
stuff like that

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
get rid of branches and everything and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.110 
get rid of branches and everything and
it's<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.319> good<00:03:49.560> for<00:03:49.669> carving<00:03:50.669> small

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
it's not so good for carving small

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.390 
it's not so good for carving small
things<00:03:51.449> like<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> spoon<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.409> anything<00:03:53.099> because

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.719 
still you break the plate yeah and it's
really<00:04:17.459> robust<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:21.299> really<00:04:21.570> like<00:04:21.780> it

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
really robust so I really really like it

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.870 
really robust so I really really like it
it<00:04:23.729> has<00:04:23.969> this<00:04:24.590> tough<00:04:25.590> thing<00:04:25.919> let's<00:04:26.130> see<00:04:26.430> if<00:04:26.729> I

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
it has this tough thing let's see if I

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.950 
it has this tough thing let's see if I
can<00:04:27.440> see<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.770> is

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.290 

it's<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.050> Teflon<00:04:35.470> coating<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.780> it's<00:04:38.850> just<00:04:39.850> a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.990 

thing<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.630> prevent<00:04:44.260> it<00:04:44.440> from<00:04:44.620> rusting<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:46.300> I

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
thing to prevent it from rusting but I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.360 
thing to prevent it from rusting but I
noticed<00:04:49.000> when<00:04:49.480> I'm<00:04:49.600> using<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:52.560> it<00:04:53.560> does<00:04:53.920> come

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
noticed when I'm using it it does come

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.880 
noticed when I'm using it it does come
off<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:59.460> if<00:05:00.460> I'm<00:05:00.700> using<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.180> for<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.510> couple<00:05:01.890> of

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
off so if I'm using it for a couple of

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.610 
off so if I'm using it for a couple of
years<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.460> probably<00:05:03.610> will<00:05:04.090> go<00:05:04.630> off<00:05:04.840> everywhere

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
years it probably will go off everywhere

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.640 
years it probably will go off everywhere
but<00:05:06.610> with<00:05:07.060> all<00:05:07.270> carbon<00:05:07.540> steel<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.050> life<00:05:08.230> you

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
but with all carbon steel in life you

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.010 
but with all carbon steel in life you
should<00:05:08.830> really<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.430> mean<00:05:09.970> when<00:05:10.360> you're<00:05:10.510> done

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
should really I mean when you're done

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.550 
should really I mean when you're done
with<00:05:11.260> it

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
with it

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.170 
with it
oil<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:12.010> in<00:05:12.300> prevented<00:05:13.300> from<00:05:13.480> rusting<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.970> take

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
oil it in prevented from rusting to take

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.660 
oil it in prevented from rusting to take
good<00:05:19.540> care<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.170> good<00:05:20.470> knife<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:21.190> shouldn't

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
good care of a good knife you shouldn't

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.310 
good care of a good knife you shouldn't
just<00:05:22.090> sharpen<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:22.810> should<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.550> mean<00:05:24.550> put

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
just sharpen it you should I mean put

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.350 
just sharpen it you should I mean put
some<00:05:26.320> oil<00:05:26.500> on<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.130> stuff<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:28.030> won't

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
some oil on it and stuff so it won't

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.060 
some oil on it and stuff so it won't
rust<00:05:30.000> let's<00:05:31.000> see<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:32.020> battery<00:05:32.380> is<00:05:32.470> almost<00:05:32.680> out

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
rust let's see the battery is almost out

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:44.469 
rust let's see the battery is almost out
of<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.370> camera<00:05:33.790> so<00:05:34.000> I<00:05:34.240> make<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.230> short

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.600 

the<00:05:45.479> handle<00:05:45.960> is<00:05:46.169> all<00:05:46.680> rubber<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:48.360> even<00:05:49.610> if

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
the handle is all rubber so even if

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.279 
the handle is all rubber so even if
you're<00:05:50.900> wet

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
you're wet

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.420 
you're wet
I<00:05:52.460> mean<00:05:53.460> what<00:05:53.669> environment<00:05:54.949> you<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:55.979> a<00:05:56.129> good

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
I mean what environment you have a good

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.149 
I mean what environment you have a good
great<00:05:56.789> good<00:05:57.419> really<00:05:58.020> really<00:05:58.050> good<00:05:58.319> with

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.129 

that's<00:06:02.159> one<00:06:02.819> of<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.060> most<00:06:03.270> important<00:06:03.870> things

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
that's one of the most important things

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.860 
that's one of the most important things
because<00:06:04.409> when<00:06:05.190> you're<00:06:05.340> cutting<00:06:05.970> stuff<00:06:06.419> with<00:06:06.840> a

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
because when you're cutting stuff with a

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.640 
because when you're cutting stuff with a
wet<00:06:07.050> tan<00:06:07.319> it<00:06:08.220> will<00:06:08.639> easily<00:06:09.270> slide<00:06:10.050> out<00:06:10.289> and

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
wet tan it will easily slide out and

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.749 
wet tan it will easily slide out and
then<00:06:11.009> you<00:06:11.190> have<00:06:11.370> bringing<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.360> bad<00:06:12.509> wound<00:06:13.759> but

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
then you have bringing a bad wound but
