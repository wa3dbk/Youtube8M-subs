much lighter in pigmentation this one is

the chardonnay this is rice paper so
actually<00:02:33.670> i<00:02:34.210> don't<00:02:34.540> think<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.990> one<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
actually i don't think that one is the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.400 
actually i don't think that one is the
closest<00:02:36.280> what<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.240> think<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> closest<00:02:38.200> might

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
closest what I think the closest might

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.900 
closest what I think the closest might
be<00:02:38.620> might<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.340> flip<00:02:40.290> yep<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:42.430> right<00:02:42.670> you've

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910

got<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.480> Chardonnay<00:02:44.490> rice<00:02:45.490> paper<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.180> flip

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
got the Chardonnay rice paper and flip

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.140 
got the Chardonnay rice paper and flip
flip<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.290> from<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.980> blonde<00:02:48.520> brunette<00:02:48.820> redhead

flip is from the blonde brunette redhead
collection<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.070> think<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> color

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
collection and I think it is the color

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.300 
collection and I think it is the color
that<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.660> closest<00:02:53.410> however<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.950> definitely

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that is closest however it definitely

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.470 
that is closest however it definitely
has<00:02:54.459> more<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.239> shimmery<00:02:55.810> undertone<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.500> it

has more of a shimmery undertone to it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.210 
has more of a shimmery undertone to it
