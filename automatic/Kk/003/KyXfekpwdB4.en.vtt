Yo guys, Blade here, today I wanna show you 
how to:

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:09.066
Install and use Elite Tool for MW3

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First, go to the description of this vid

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.066
You are opening mediafire link 

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.033
Download it

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.033
And then you've got window like this one

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.033

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.033
What does it have?

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.066
You've got 3 tabs:

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.066
Clan Tag

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.033
Title Text

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.033
And deleting those things from your nickname

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.066
How to make it work?

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:55.033
First, you have to launch MW3 and enter lobby

00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:04.033
I know that you can't really see anything right 
now, but i couldnt figure it out either in 
camtasia or fraps :/

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:11.033
But here I'm just entering lobby and nothing 
else...

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:16.033
Now im in the lobby in game, you can see 
MW3 icon down there

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.000
Now you are entering whatever clan tag you 
want

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.033
I'm just setting some random tag

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:31.066
Click Set Tag

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:36.033
Here you are setting your title

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:45.033
I'm showing how they all look :)

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:51.000
And here you are entering your title

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.033
Personally I like Title 4

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.033
/Text from Shrek.../

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.000
How to add colors to your title?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.033
You are doing that by adding ^ (shift + 6) 
before numbers

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:36.000
1-red 2-green 3-yellow 4-blue 5-idk 6-pink 7-
white 8,9,0-black

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.033
And now we are clicking Set Title

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:46.033
See ya in game ;D

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:50.033
We are getting in MW3 that was open whole 
time

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:54.033
And we have it!

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:58.033
colors...

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:10.066
Everything works, soooo PRO 

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:15.000
How to not get ban for it?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.033
You just need to close Elite Tool

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:25.033
Close it and you are fine :)

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:29.033
It didn't record when I closed Elite Tool, but 
that's not to complecated ;D

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:37.033
And I'm talking about some shit... xD

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.000
Sooo... 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
If you want, add this vid to your favourites to 
find it easly :)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.033
Send it to your friends if they want it

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:58.066
The only thing that this hack can make to you 
is raging players in game because you have 
something they don't...

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.033
So just send them this vid xD

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.033
And then they will also have it :D

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:07.000
Bye :) 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.033
I'm Blade
