transformer run backwards to light up a
modified<00:00:12.210> CFL<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:14.630> I've<00:00:15.630> worked<00:00:16.109> some<00:00:16.379> more

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
modified CFL and I've worked some more

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.620 
modified CFL and I've worked some more
on<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.890> along<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> Sky<00:00:17.850> Watcher<00:00:18.240> idea

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
on this along with the Sky Watcher idea

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.130 
on this along with the Sky Watcher idea
of<00:00:18.900> putting<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.970> batteries<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.150> series<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
of putting up batteries in series in a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.400 
of putting up batteries in series in a
different<00:00:22.500> way<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.490> came<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.910> this

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
different way and it came up with this

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.070 
different way and it came up with this
thing<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> show<00:00:25.769> today<00:00:26.449> first<00:00:27.449> off<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> bulb

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
thing to show today first off the bulb

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
thing to show today first off the bulb
amusing<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:30.529> 60-watt<00:00:32.000> bulb<00:00:33.000> that's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
amusing here is a 60-watt bulb that's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.080 
amusing here is a 60-watt bulb that's
been<00:00:33.840> gutted<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> guts<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
been gutted and it's just the guts and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.500 
been gutted and it's just the guts and
then<00:00:36.809> i'm<00:00:36.930> using<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.410> wall<00:00:37.649> outlet<00:00:38.510> transformer

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
then i'm using a wall outlet transformer

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
then i'm using a wall outlet transformer
that<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:43.129> 3.7<00:00:44.129> bolts<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.860> run<00:00:46.860> backwards<00:00:47.520> it's

the<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.479> part<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.140> project<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
the other part of this project was the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
the other part of this project was the
Sky<00:01:21.960> Watcher<00:01:22.470> idea<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.310> taking<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:26.180> batteries

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
Sky Watcher idea of taking the batteries

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.780 
Sky Watcher idea of taking the batteries
and<00:01:27.770> grouping<00:01:28.770> them<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> such<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> way<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and grouping them in such a way that you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
and grouping them in such a way that you
could<00:01:29.970> charge<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.840> group<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> doublea's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
could charge up a group of doublea's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609 
could charge up a group of doublea's
that<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.700> put<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.000> parallel<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.500> when

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that are put in parallel and then when

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
that are put in parallel and then when
they<00:01:34.650> charged<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.640> exchange<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.210> with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
they charged up you exchange them with

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
they charged up you exchange them with
the<00:01:36.540> group<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.990> double<00:01:37.320> a's<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> were<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the group of double a's that were in

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
the group of double a's that were in
series<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> higher<00:01:39.000> voltage<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
series to make the higher voltage so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.399 
series to make the higher voltage so
what<00:01:40.560> i<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> battery<00:01:41.549> pack<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
what i have here is a battery pack of

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
what i have here is a battery pack of
eight<00:01:43.409> double<00:01:44.040> a's<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.610> about<00:01:44.909> 12<00:01:45.240> volts

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
eight double a's to make about 12 volts

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.399 
eight double a's to make about 12 volts
and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.710> two<00:01:47.009> battery<00:01:47.579> packs<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.509> 1.5

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and then two battery packs that are 1.5

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.490 
and then two battery packs that are 1.5
volts<00:01:49.860> connected<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.149> strange<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
volts connected in a very strange way it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.480 
volts connected in a very strange way it
feed<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> light<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> power<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.490> way

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
feed the light the power and the way

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.450 
feed the light the power and the way
this<00:01:56.640> works<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.740> energy<00:01:59.009> flows<00:01:59.250> around

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this works is as the energy flows around

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.690 
this works is as the energy flows around
it<00:01:59.939> gets<00:02:00.090> dropped<00:02:00.329> down<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.869> voltage<00:02:01.700> both

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
it gets dropped down in voltage both

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
it gets dropped down in voltage both
directions<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> feed<00:02:04.079> voltage<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.770> about

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
directions to a feed voltage of about

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.639 
directions to a feed voltage of about
nine<00:02:05.280> volts<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.409> when<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> use

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
nine volts here and when you use

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
nine volts here and when you use
capacitors<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:08.940> things<00:02:09.239> climb<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.840> here

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
capacitors is these things climb up here

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
capacitors is these things climb up here
these<00:02:10.259> are<00:02:10.319> capacitors<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.730> would<00:02:11.910> slowly

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
these are capacitors it would slowly

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.880 
these are capacitors it would slowly
starve<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.230> circuit

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
starve that circuit

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100 
starve that circuit
to<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> light<00:02:14.520> would<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.270> but

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to when the light would just go out but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
to when the light would just go out but
when<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:16.560> batteries<00:02:17.160> especially<00:02:17.610> like

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
when you use batteries especially like

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.300 
when you use batteries especially like
this<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:19.020> voltage<00:02:19.380> drops<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> doesn't

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
this the voltage drops but it doesn't

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.370 
this the voltage drops but it doesn't
drop<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.730> bow<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:21.959> still<00:02:22.170> run

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
drop that bow so that you can still run

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.410 
drop that bow so that you can still run
the<00:02:22.500> light<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.010> does<00:02:23.760> charge<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.270> these

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the light and does charge up these

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.590 
the light and does charge up these
batteries<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.350> here's<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.830> setup<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
batteries and here's the setup it's a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.410 
batteries and here's the setup it's a
group<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.110> eight<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:29.190> make<00:02:29.340> about<00:02:29.580> 12<00:02:29.970> volts

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
group of eight to make about 12 volts

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.199 
group of eight to make about 12 volts
there<00:02:30.980> rechargeable<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.280> not<00:02:32.459> really<00:02:32.520> 12

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
there rechargeable so it's not really 12

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.510 
there rechargeable so it's not really 12
it's<00:02:33.360> less<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.800> i<00:02:34.890> rewired<00:02:35.310> these

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
it's less and then i rewired these

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's less and then i rewired these
battery<00:02:35.910> packs<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.780> more

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
battery packs so that it's more

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.460 
battery packs so that it's more
batteries<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.610> make<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.880> 1.5<00:02:39.450> volts<00:02:40.020> two<00:02:40.320> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
batteries and make up 1.5 volts two of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.560 
batteries and make up 1.5 volts two of
them<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.459> run<00:02:41.640> around<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> circuit

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
them and you run around to the circuit

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.690 
them and you run around to the circuit
I'm<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> turn<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.250> I'll<00:02:44.430> show<00:02:44.489> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'm going to turn this on I'll show you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.520 
I'm going to turn this on I'll show you
what<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:44.970> looks<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:46.050> bulb<00:02:46.320> does

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
what it looks like now this bulb does

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.920 
what it looks like now this bulb does
not<00:02:46.680> come<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.250> full<00:02:47.489> bright<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.540> can't<00:02:48.780> make

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
not come on full bright and I can't make

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.320 
not come on full bright and I can't make
a<00:02:48.989> comment<00:02:49.320> fulbright<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:50.970> enough<00:02:51.209> to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
a comment fulbright but it's enough to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
a comment fulbright but it's enough to
show<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> principle<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.040> we're<00:02:53.190> doing

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
show the principle now what we're doing

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
show the principle now what we're doing
here<00:02:55.400> comes<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.610> bulb<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.930> vary<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
here comes the bulb I can vary the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.710 
here comes the bulb I can vary the
brightness<00:03:01.890> by<00:03:02.330> adjusting<00:03:03.330> this

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
brightness by adjusting this

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.770 
brightness by adjusting this
potentiometer<00:03:04.320> right<00:03:04.830> here<00:03:05.360> which<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.570> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
potentiometer right here which is that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.160 
potentiometer right here which is that
one<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.320> there<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.709> circuit<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:09.170> believe

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
one right there in the circuit I believe

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.979 
one right there in the circuit I believe
that<00:03:10.200> adjusts<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.860> frequency<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.840> one

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
that adjusts the frequency and the one

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.090 
that adjusts the frequency and the one
up<00:03:13.140> here<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:14.120> 10k<00:03:15.120> resistor<00:03:15.959> would<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.920> been

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
up here the 10k resistor would have been

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.490 
up here the 10k resistor would have been
the<00:03:17.250> duty<00:03:17.519> cycle<00:03:17.810> well<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:18.989> doing<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the duty cycle well this is doing the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.930 
the duty cycle well this is doing the
frequency<00:03:20.040> right<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.610> watch<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
frequency right here and watch the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:31.890 
frequency right here and watch the
brightness<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.510> up<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.780> down<00:03:21.930> as<00:03:22.110> i<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.290> this

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.899 

and<00:03:32.349> like<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.739> say<00:03:32.920> what's<00:03:33.159> happening<00:03:33.610> here<00:03:33.849> is

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
and like I say what's happening here is

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.410 
and like I say what's happening here is
this<00:03:34.209> battery<00:03:34.750> pack<00:03:34.989> here<00:03:35.909> is<00:03:36.909> running

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
this battery pack here is running

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.449 
this battery pack here is running
through<00:03:37.689> that<00:03:37.989> battery<00:03:38.409> pack<00:03:38.680> feeding<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
through that battery pack feeding the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.059 
through that battery pack feeding the
circuit<00:03:39.970> then<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.989> return<00:03:41.349> this<00:03:41.709> battery

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
circuit then on the return this battery

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.199 
circuit then on the return this battery
pack<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:43.019> being<00:03:44.019> fed<00:03:44.890> energy<00:03:45.370> on<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.879> way<00:03:46.000> back

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
pack is being fed energy on the way back

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.479 
pack is being fed energy on the way back
to<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.540> battery<00:03:46.989> pack<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:48.099> circuit

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
to this battery pack and the circuit

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.390 
to this battery pack and the circuit
looks<00:03:48.640> like<00:03:48.879> that<00:03:49.349> it's<00:03:50.349> very<00:03:50.530> strange<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.310> a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
looks like that it's very strange it's a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.020 
looks like that it's very strange it's a
strange<00:03:51.760> way<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.060> do<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.950> don't<00:03:54.849> know

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
strange way to do this and I don't know

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.670 
strange way to do this and I don't know
I<00:03:55.060> call<00:03:55.359> it<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.510> crazy<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:56.140> because<00:03:56.409> it's<00:03:56.590> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I call it the crazy like because it's a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.630 
I call it the crazy like because it's a
crazy<00:03:56.950> crazy<00:03:57.879> setup<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:59.340> don't<00:04:00.340> think<00:04:00.519> it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
crazy crazy setup and I don't think it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.069 
crazy crazy setup and I don't think it
really<00:04:00.670> works<00:04:00.879> but<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.450> was<00:04:01.569> very<00:04:01.599> very

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
really works but it was very very

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.780 
really works but it was very very
interesting<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.859> had<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.069> lot<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.250> lump<00:04:03.549> plan

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
interesting I had a lot of lump plan

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.190 
interesting I had a lot of lump plan
with<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:05.019> idea<00:04:05.349> was<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.680> when<00:04:06.459> these

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
with it and the idea was that when these

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.530 
with it and the idea was that when these
charged<00:04:08.200> up<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.799> this<00:04:09.250> one<00:04:09.459> depletes<00:04:09.909> you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
charged up and this one depletes you

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.210 
charged up and this one depletes you
take<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.930> batteries<00:04:11.349> out<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.650> here<00:04:11.859> you<00:04:12.010> put

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
take the batteries out of here you put

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.979 
take the batteries out of here you put
them<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.400> there<00:04:12.639> you<00:04:13.299> take<00:04:13.510> those<00:04:13.750> eight

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
them in there you take those eight

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.590 
them in there you take those eight
batteries<00:04:14.440> split<00:04:15.010> them<00:04:15.129> up<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.639> in<00:04:16.090> charge<00:04:16.329> up

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
batteries split them up and in charge up

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.050 
batteries split them up and in charge up
these<00:04:16.810> eight<00:04:17.109> separately<00:04:17.889> from<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:18.789> eight

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
these eight separately from the eight

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.210 
these eight separately from the eight
that<00:04:19.090> are<00:04:19.449> done<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.870> series<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.889> cycle

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
that are done in series you just cycle

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.820 
that are done in series you just cycle
them<00:04:21.340> around<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.729> around<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.060> around<00:04:22.229> now<00:04:23.229> it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
them around and around and around now it

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.680 
them around and around and around now it
wont<00:04:24.010> self-sustained<00:04:24.760> obviously<00:04:25.360> you'd<00:04:25.510> have

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
wont self-sustained obviously you'd have

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.200 
wont self-sustained obviously you'd have
to<00:04:25.810> add<00:04:25.960> mode<00:04:26.229> joules<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.740> energy<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.940> it's<00:04:28.060> an

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
to add mode joules of energy but it's an

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.629 
to add mode joules of energy but it's an
interesting<00:04:28.539> circuit<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.680> every<00:04:30.220> time<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> do

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
interesting circuit and every time I do

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.950 
interesting circuit and every time I do
a<00:04:30.759> circuit<00:04:31.180> that's<00:04:31.360> interesting<00:04:31.840> i've
