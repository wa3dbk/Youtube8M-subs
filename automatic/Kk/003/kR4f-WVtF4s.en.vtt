00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.950
 in every game you have to wait 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.590
 something unexpected and the English of 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.880
 channels for suspect 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 although you are the most experienced of the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.770
 circulation books although you have 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.919
 made a thousand matches faced thousand 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.590
 players solved a thousand conflicts though 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.330
 can always happen to me the thing that up to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 that moment is never dealt with you must 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.460
 always be ready to handle 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 we work to be perfect us 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.250
 we work to reduce the percentage 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 of errors 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.019
 the ideal for a referee is to finish the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.690
 match so that no one does 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.820
 remember who the referee was in the field and who 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.769
 sometimes we find angry fans 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.899
 for our decisions, so yes 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.549
 fill with insults and insults because 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.190
 I like to talk about the moods of the 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.409
 building we can understand when 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.090
 the building is festive when it is 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.070
 angry with one of the two teams 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.110
 when he is angry with us he feels 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.259
 right from the mood of the people 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.530
 the tones go up they descend joy anger 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.869
 disappointment thousand feelings yes yes 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.010
 they all pour in a few moments 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.570
 a few seconds and we usually arrive 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.630
 an hour and a half an hour and a quarter before 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 I play a training session 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.970
 double on one side from a point of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.770
 aerobic view 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 second aspect is that instead of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.630
 power of speed because basketball 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.660
 modern athletes are really gods 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.550
 jumping athletes really run into 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.110
 explosive manner and therefore we do not 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.420
 we can afford to get in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 delay you counterattack every time 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.330
 park the car 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.790
 I'm about to enter a building 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 the image of a child comes to mind 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.900
 small when he asks me but father does not 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.960
 they scare 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.720
 all those giants another two meters 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.160
 near you and that they have to endure 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.820
 all decisions 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.820
 no 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.620
 12 seconds difference compared to 24 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.700
 gianluca that of no 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.700
 mammamia one please 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.260
 however they always arrive in stadiums 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.970
 charming kids today we will put the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.320
 gray t-shirt from italy and gray 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.880
 while as you know abroad 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.650
 we also use colored sweaters 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.420
 do not reset immediately 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.390
 the appliance waits a moment and we will be 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.900
 we tell who to reset captain in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.900
 good luck 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.280
 display 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
 then we expected a game 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.740
 immediately intense and this takes from 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.740
 request our concentration 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.740
 maxim 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.019
 it was a nice experience 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.180
 have fun and it was a good game of 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.549
 basketball and Monday you have to go back to 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.109
 work but we'll look at this anyway 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.370
 match with great professionalism 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.810
 let's do all the basketball 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 definitely part of the underworld
