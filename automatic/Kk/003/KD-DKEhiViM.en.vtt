 hello welcome to the curl channel 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.520
 Peaceful fish kisses for all 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.580
 and I thank you all for being here 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.710
 again and in domm in this space that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.190
 a very simple hairstyle is brought that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.820
 I did with my braids and some videos of 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.059
 permanent or see them in robots in 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.440
 English I hope you enjoy it that you like it 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 and half your comments 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
 start with the soft massages and cough in 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 the scalp to stimulate the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.940
 circulation and its growth this pretty 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.940
 with castor oil 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.820
 then I divide it into sections so that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.360
 make it easier to manipulate 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 and already with each selection I separate 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.380
 smaller sections to start to 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380
 braid 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520
 do not 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.120
 to make this braid use 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.720
 a combing cream and he gets me with a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.720
 little oil 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.070
 ah 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.500
 ah 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.900
 Y 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 ah 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.420
 then softened with a little gel either 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.590
 flaxseed or have you the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.020
 alcohol I put the live on the tip and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 from the tip to the scalp 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.450
 I begin to wrap 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.250
 and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.690
 that's all my loves that simple 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.569
 is to make these braids with the help 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.879
 of your whiskers to permanent then 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.659
 finished in all the hair 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.659
 by the same process 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.060
 Y 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.260
 ah 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.550
 Y 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.770
 that is the result when all my 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.770
 hair is with braided dates 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.880
 Y 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.090
 the next day retreat 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.390
 my satin bonnet that is important 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.690
 to avoid the cold during your sleep and 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.340
 I start to undo each of the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.890
 braids to achieve 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.890
 shape the hair at the end 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.120
 already separating each braid makes it the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.920
 volume you want and more skinny in 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.920
 the curls or thicker 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.970
 I shake later to increase a little 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.970
 in volume and that's it 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.490
 those are very final results I hope 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.409
 that you like, I hope you leave your 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.080

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.629
