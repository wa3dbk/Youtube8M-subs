hey<00:00:04.359> guys<00:00:04.630> I'm<00:00:04.930> going<00:00:05.109> to<00:00:05.140> be<00:00:05.229> doing<00:00:05.380> an

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.500 
hey guys I'm going to be doing an

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.390 
hey guys I'm going to be doing an
unboxing<00:00:05.830> of<00:00:06.279> the<00:00:06.340> audio<00:00:07.000> engine<00:00:07.650> d1<00:00:08.650> premium

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
unboxing of the audio engine d1 premium

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.549 
unboxing of the audio engine d1 premium
24-bit<00:00:10.559> USB<00:00:11.559> DAC<00:00:12.129> now<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.900> DAC<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.530> a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
24-bit USB DAC now so DAC is a

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.779 
24-bit USB DAC now so DAC is a
digital-to-analog<00:00:16.170> nope<00:00:17.170> digital<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.740> audio

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
digital-to-analog nope digital to audio

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.370 
digital-to-analog nope digital to audio
converter<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.570> can<00:00:22.810> work<00:00:22.960> as<00:00:23.199> like<00:00:23.349> a

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
converter so this can work as like a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
converter so this can work as like a
sound<00:00:23.740> card<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.900> your<00:00:26.109> computer<00:00:26.800> or<00:00:27.580> some<00:00:27.970> as

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sound card for your computer or some as

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
so we now have a layer of protective

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.770 
so we now have a layer of protective
foam<00:01:25.090> over<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> top<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.340> then<00:01:27.579> we<00:01:27.700> then<00:01:27.909> get<00:01:28.179> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.039 

set-up<00:01:31.780> guide<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:33.359> hope<00:01:34.359> villagers<00:01:34.810> take

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
set-up guide so this hope villagers take

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.480 
set-up guide so this hope villagers take
us<00:01:35.229> how<00:01:35.380> we're<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.710> get<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:35.920> up<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.189> our

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
us how we're going to get this up to our

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.990 
us how we're going to get this up to our
computers<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:39.039> looks<00:01:39.250> like<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.520> does<00:01:39.729> just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
computers and it looks like it does just

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.630 
computers and it looks like it does just
that<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:42.130> also<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.939> audio<00:01:43.600> engine<00:01:44.640> product

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
that we also get a audio engine product

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.139 
that we also get a audio engine product
guide<00:01:45.880> or<00:01:46.119> just<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:47.789> tells<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:48.880> what<00:01:49.000> we've

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
guide or just so tells you what we've

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.209 
guide or just so tells you what we've
got<00:01:49.329> we<00:01:49.959> can<00:01:50.079> get<00:01:50.229> from<00:01:50.350> audio<00:01:50.649> engine<00:01:50.920> as<00:01:51.130> a

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
got we can get from audio engine as a

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.760 
got we can get from audio engine as a
big<00:01:51.459> tulip<00:01:53.189> speakers<00:01:54.189> which<00:01:54.399> they<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:55.770> right

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
big tulip speakers which they do right

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.979 
big tulip speakers which they do right
you<00:01:57.579> actually<00:01:58.119> get<00:01:58.209> down<00:01:58.239> to<00:01:58.569> what<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.810> get

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
you actually get down to what you get

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:04.740 
you actually get down to what you get
with<00:01:59.349> the<00:01:59.619> kit<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.479> get<00:02:01.689> a<00:02:02.789> USB<00:02:03.789> cable<00:02:04.299> which

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
with the kit you get a USB cable which

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.819 
with the kit you get a USB cable which
will<00:02:05.229> go<00:02:05.979> from<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.369> DAC<00:02:06.959> straight<00:02:07.959> to<00:02:08.530> your

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
will go from the DAC straight to your

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
will go from the DAC straight to your
computer

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
computer

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.509 
computer
I'm<00:02:10.690> silica<00:02:11.200> gel<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.560> keep<00:02:11.739> everything<00:02:12.040> fresh

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
I'm silica gel to keep everything fresh

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.250 
I'm silica gel to keep everything fresh
a<00:02:14.430> nice<00:02:15.430> little<00:02:17.370> helps<00:02:18.370> their<00:02:18.579> fourth<00:02:18.879> back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a nice little helps their fourth back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110 
a nice little helps their fourth back
with<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.349> drawstrings<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.190> keep<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.519> safe<00:02:21.790> you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
with the drawstrings to keep it safe you

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.140 
with the drawstrings to keep it safe you
know<00:02:22.209> usually<00:02:22.720> using<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.410> portable<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
know usually using is portable and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.309 
know usually using is portable and
finally<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.769> get<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.750> DAC<00:02:31.049> which<00:02:32.049> is<00:02:32.170> of

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
finally we get the DAC which is of

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.229 
finally we get the DAC which is of
course<00:02:32.590> very<00:02:32.799> nice<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.819> now<00:02:34.000> I'm<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
course very nice so now I'm going to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
back of our audio engine d1 we have a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.270 
back of our audio engine d1 we have a
few<00:03:26.560> different<00:03:26.950> types<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.910> outlet<00:03:28.300> inputs<00:03:28.780> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
few different types of outlet inputs and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.740 
few different types of outlet inputs and
in<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.400> case<00:03:30.700> we're<00:03:30.880> going<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.270> USB

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
in this case we're going to use the USB

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.350 
in this case we're going to use the USB
input<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.800> could<00:03:33.010> choose<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.550> use<00:03:33.670> an<00:03:33.790> optical

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
input you could choose to use an optical

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.090 
input you could choose to use an optical
input<00:03:34.600> from<00:03:34.900> your<00:03:35.020> computer<00:03:35.470> as<00:03:35.590> well<00:03:35.770> but<00:03:36.040> I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
input from your computer as well but I
