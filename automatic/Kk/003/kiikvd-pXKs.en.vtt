00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:01:03.290 

over<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:50.629> spring<00:00:54.680> goop<00:00:57.109> I<00:01:02.120> always<00:01:03.120> wanna

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
over here spring goop I always wanna

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
over here spring goop I always wanna
make<00:01:03.329> sure<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> fits<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.290> before<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
make sure this fits in there before you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
make sure this fits in there before you
assemble<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> sometimes<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.150> bind<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
assemble it sometimes they bind up and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
assemble it sometimes they bind up and
the<00:01:06.840> only<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.350> half<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.159> means

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the only going about half way that means

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.649 
the only going about half way that means
the<00:01:08.400> bushing<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.760> sticking<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.210> high

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the bushing is sticking up too high

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
the bushing is sticking up too high
make<00:01:10.619> sure<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.890> fit<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:13.159> see<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.310> tie

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
make sure they fit first see if you tie

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
make sure they fit first see if you tie
them<00:01:14.520> come<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> work<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> later<00:01:15.650> okay

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
them come back to work on it later okay

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.810 
cheater pop in there yeah there we go
I'd<00:03:51.959> release<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.470> see<00:03:58.160> see<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> ratchets<00:03:59.670> not

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
I'd release it see see the ratchets not

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.840 
I'd release it see see the ratchets not
quite<00:04:00.120> engaging<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> way<00:04:00.900> though<00:04:01.850> is

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
quite engaging all the way though is

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.820 
quite engaging all the way though is
something<00:04:03.060> binding<00:04:03.510> up<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:07.590> teeth

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
something binding up on it just teeth

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.500 
something binding up on it just teeth
aren't<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.250> all<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.370> way<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.580> checked<00:04:09.360> out

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
aren't going all the way in checked out

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.580 
aren't going all the way in checked out
before<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.900> remember<00:04:10.320> yep

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
before I remember yep

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.270 
before I remember yep
why<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.890> because<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:14.430> bugger<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.269> up

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.950 

my<00:04:20.280> guess<00:04:20.549> would<00:04:20.790> be<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:23.000> keys<00:04:24.000> are<00:04:24.240> slid

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
my guess would be that the keys are slid

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.890 
my guess would be that the keys are slid
down<00:04:25.140> slightly

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
down slightly

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.400 
down slightly
maybe<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.050> guess<00:04:30.800> could<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.070> grease<00:04:33.410> kind

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
maybe my guess could be just grease kind

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.210 
maybe my guess could be just grease kind
of<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.560> soft<00:04:35.000> deal<00:04:36.620> do<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.010> would<00:04:38.100> be

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
of a soft deal do you think it would be

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.760 
of a soft deal do you think it would be
good<00:04:38.580> grease<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.180> would<00:04:39.500> dissipate<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> out

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
good grease it would dissipate it out

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:54.590 
good grease it would dissipate it out
already<00:04:43.100> raised<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.220> don't<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:53.600> yeah

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
already raised I don't like it yeah

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.480 
already raised I don't like it yeah
that's<00:04:54.780> pulling<00:04:55.020> engage<00:04:55.350> now<00:04:55.680> whatever<00:04:56.370> you

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
this and rotate it around a little bit

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.830 
this and rotate it around a little bit
here<00:05:45.810> there<00:05:46.620> we<00:05:46.710> go

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840
