00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.080 
vintage voice yeah they they kind of are
it's<00:02:05.299> like<00:02:05.920> wewe<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> bead<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.520> guitar<00:02:07.880> with

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
it's like wewe a bead this guitar with

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.490 
it's like wewe a bead this guitar with
the<00:02:08.209> 60s<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:08.929> know<00:02:09.069> 6335<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:12.019> output<00:02:12.410> on

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the 60s you know 6335 and the output on

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.320 
the 60s you know 6335 and the output on
the<00:02:12.530> pickups<00:02:12.920> was<00:02:13.340> roughly<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.879> same<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
the pickups was roughly the same in

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.750 
the pickups was roughly the same in
humbucker<00:02:14.660> mode<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.110> then<00:02:15.170> slightly

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
humbucker mode and then slightly

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.850 
humbucker mode and then slightly
obviously<00:02:16.760> quieter<00:02:17.209> in<00:02:17.330> single-coil<00:02:17.780> mode<00:02:17.900> so

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
obviously quieter in single-coil mode so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.000 
obviously quieter in single-coil mode so
do<00:02:19.069> we<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.190> two<00:02:19.489> volumes<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.269> master<00:02:20.630> tone

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
do we have two volumes in a master tone

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.830 
do we have two volumes in a master tone
this<00:02:22.010> guitar<00:02:22.400> actually<00:02:22.790> has<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:24.349> has<00:02:24.530> like<00:02:24.799> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
this guitar actually has it has like a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.870 
this guitar actually has it has like a
black<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:27.019> base<00:02:27.260> I'm<00:02:27.590> sorry<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:28.519> has<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.819> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
black up base I'm sorry it has like a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.600 
black up base I'm sorry it has like a
bass<00:02:29.120> roll-off<00:02:29.720> control<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.280> sense<00:02:31.459> it's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
bass roll-off control so the sense it's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.580 
bass roll-off control so the sense it's
Hollow<00:02:31.819> what<00:02:32.629> will<00:02:32.750> happen<00:02:32.870> sometimes<00:02:33.440> when

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
Hollow what will happen sometimes when

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.770 
Hollow what will happen sometimes when
you're<00:02:33.739> super<00:02:34.370> high<00:02:34.489> gain<00:02:34.760> mode<00:02:35.000> it's<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you're super high gain mode it's like a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.750 
you're super high gain mode it's like a
335<00:02:36.440> you'll<00:02:36.799> start<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.099> get<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> little<00:02:37.340> bit<00:02:37.640> of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
335 you'll start to get a little bit of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.080 
335 you'll start to get a little bit of
extra<00:02:38.799> harmonic<00:02:39.799> feedback<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.579> don't<00:02:40.790> want

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
extra harmonic feedback you don't want

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
extra harmonic feedback you don't want
you<00:02:41.569> can<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.900> drop<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.349> control<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> little

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
you can just drop this control a little

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710 
you can just drop this control a little
bit<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.459> kinda<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.299> of<00:02:44.360> control

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
bit in it kinda you can kind of control

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.350 
bit in it kinda you can kind of control
that<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.099> got<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> volume<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.940> tone<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
that so it's got a volume of tone and a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.420 
that so it's got a volume of tone and a
little<00:02:47.599> bass<00:02:47.810> roll-off<00:02:48.260> thing<00:02:48.500> let's<00:02:49.250> hear<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
little bass roll-off thing let's hear a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:26.180 
little bass roll-off thing let's hear a
few<00:02:49.579> different<00:02:49.670> samples

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.860 

got<00:03:27.190> some<00:03:27.340> great<00:03:27.550> tone<00:03:27.880> combinations<00:03:28.630> out<00:03:28.750> of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
got some great tone combinations out of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.110 
got some great tone combinations out of
that<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.140> you're<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.440> through<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.770> /<00:03:30.370> 13<00:03:30.880> amp

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
that and you're going through a / 13 amp

which model is that CJ 11 okay and which
pedals<00:03:34.750> are<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.959> plugged<00:03:35.350> into<00:03:35.530> actually

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
pedals are you plugged into actually

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.670 
pedals are you plugged into actually
this<00:03:36.730> pedal<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.810> opto<00:03:38.200> compressor

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
this pedal here is an opto compressor

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.440 
this pedal here is an opto compressor
that<00:03:38.709> was<00:03:38.950> designed<00:03:39.340> by<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.580> head<00:03:40.090> engineer

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that was designed by the head engineer

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.960 
that was designed by the head engineer
from<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.290> company<00:03:41.680> from<00:03:41.830> Victorian<00:03:42.459> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
from this company from Victorian and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.460 
from this company from Victorian and
it's<00:03:43.180> got<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.360> mix<00:03:43.690> knob<00:03:43.870> which<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.230> kind<00:03:44.410> of

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
it's got a mix knob which is kind of

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's got a mix knob which is kind of
cool<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.890> can<00:03:45.040> blend<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.430> amount<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
cool so you can blend in the amount of

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.270 
cool so you can blend in the amount of
compression<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.420> then<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.680> alien

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
compression and then this is a alien

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.040 
compression and then this is a alien
