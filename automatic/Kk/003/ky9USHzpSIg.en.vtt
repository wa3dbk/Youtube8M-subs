00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hi Swami, we understand, I think many 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 I agree that the file with 9 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.250
 new much more than a year 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 back to fight 8 here are the 10 most interesting 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 In my opinion, functions that can 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.070
 greatly change your experience with 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.780
 the device first is more 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.420
 cosmetic change but still on 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 lice my work with the phone i'm talking 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.859
 about multitasking now it looks 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 like this and it certainly looks like 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 it was before but still very different 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 and what I don't like the most 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 the fact that apple decided to remove the top 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 line of recent and selected contacts 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.010
 which I this year very much 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.630
 got used to and used me a lot now 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 need these spotlight to quickly 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 someone call but it turns out not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 very quickly one more minus such 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.809
 multitasking on open tabs them 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 you can not see the charge and time before 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.680
 if I for example played anything and did not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 I wanted to close the game I could just 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.949
 open multitasking and in the next 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 tab view time while not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.170
 closing the game it saved a lot of time 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.690
 but now it is not 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 the second is the notes here for the first time in a long 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 time the company led quite strong 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.260
 Changes in the first place can now 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 work type I choose italic bold 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.939
 or underlined secondly of course 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.189
 same new opportunity to draw notes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.860
 and you can draw directly on 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.450
 Photo here you have inserted well, 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 third finally the opportunity 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 format the text now it can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.610
 be not just a text but a control 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.790
 list list with ter 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.009
 or even a numbered list 3 new 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.250
 function is energy saving mode 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.780
 Alas, while he is only on the iphone this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.790
 phone mode will offer to enable when 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 20 % and 10% 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 charging and then the icon at the top will color 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.040
 in yellow 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 all details yet unknown 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.060
 the system somehow adjusts the brightness 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 sometimes consumption and different system 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 processes so that the phone spends 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.549
 as little energy as possible and as a result 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 charging really decreases slower 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.890
 though quite a bit 4 it is finally 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.530
 opportunity to reconfigure 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.969
 value of the volume buttons Well what on 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 two volume buttons 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.649
 it used to be so on the iphone she 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 responsible for turning off the sound on the iPad 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.490
 for orientation lock 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.320
 now nobody restricts you and you can 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.480
 completely calm though there even 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.550
 selection only orientation or sound only 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.790
 this is a matter of habit so for someone 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.560
 this opportunity will be very pleasant 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.420
 5 this feature which is on american 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.030
 devices appeared a year ago but on 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.770
 Russian only now we are talking about Quick 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.540
 small time from the point of the keyboard 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.730
 which constantly suggests that you can 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.190
 write here or here and in fact 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.170
 predicts your thoughts really 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.870
 a thing in some sense useful but to me and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.700
 use is not very convenient much easier 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.530
 and faster to write yourself than to watch 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.250
 up hope that the phone realized that you 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.350
 you mean 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.360
 but fortunately the cult can either 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 disable it completely or push it like this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 until better times and since we started talking about 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.610
 Keyboard can mention the sixth new 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.530
 function 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.990
 I don't know what to call it, but the easiest is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.000
 say two fingers before you go 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.620
 to some part of the text or highlight 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.510
 I had to keep waiting for the magnifying glass and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.130
 move another place now 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.370
 enough to lean the keyboard two 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.020
 finger simultaneously and highlight text 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 7 function the so-called transition from 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.920
 another application and that's how it is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.140
 size works you mean some 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.390
 application for example in safari and here you are in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.700
 contact writes your friend you press on 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.739
 notification go answer 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.050
 and then the back button appears in the upper corner 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.830
 That safari which I think to release 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.989
 will lead like back in safari press and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.200
 get back to work function is small 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.209
 but very pleasant and helpful 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.250
 8 is search settings to open it. 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.680
 just about the foresters a little up the main thing 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.270
 settings menu maybe you know what you 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.010
 need to find but do not know where 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:48.600
 and then just drive in search and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:50.670
 quickly find 9 is a small movie 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.010
 under all your photos in which 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.810
 you can see all the next pictures you can 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.370
 just hold your finger and find the right one 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.380
 photo up 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.209
 it's not faster than just flipping through photos 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.260
 but much more effective because if you 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.890
 you will be flipping then most likely 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.709
 skip what you need and the last 10 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.540
 This is of course a lot ok. 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.700
 it is possible to work simultaneously with any 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.890
 application and one of the systems or 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.960
 photo messages in calendar mail 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.910
 calculator and so on 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.650
 also now you can do anything 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.540
 at the same time watch the video in small 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.350
 a window that can also be moved by 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.810
 the whole screen 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.720
 This is a very convenient feature but it works. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.830
 It is partially on ipad air mini 2 and 3 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.810
 completely only on the most powerful oh ptr2 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.330
 These are the top 10 and interesting and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.520
 useful new features you 9 which 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.490
 maybe not for the better but it will definitely change 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.510
 your work with your phone or tablet 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.280
 thanks for watching like 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.490
 subscribe to the channel and it was understand 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.490
