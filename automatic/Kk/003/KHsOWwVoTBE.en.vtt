okay<00:00:00.420> in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:01.020> I'm<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> do<00:00:01.800> some

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay in this video I'm going to do some

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.510 
okay in this video I'm going to do some
benchmarks<00:00:02.820> on<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.300> Nexus<00:00:03.840> 7<00:00:04.470> tablet<00:00:04.799> running

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
benchmarks on the Nexus 7 tablet running

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:35.810 
benchmarks on the Nexus 7 tablet running
jellybean<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.660> let's<00:00:06.839> get<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.080> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.580 

so<00:00:36.820> I<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.149> folder<00:00:37.480> here<00:00:37.840> with<00:00:38.379> some

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
so I have a folder here with some

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.710 
so I have a folder here with some
benchmarking<00:00:39.160> apps<00:00:39.430> actually<00:00:40.120> four<00:00:40.449> of<00:00:40.600> them

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
benchmarking apps actually four of them

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.990 
benchmarking apps actually four of them
and<00:00:40.899> in<00:00:41.769> this<00:00:41.920> video<00:00:42.100> we're<00:00:42.519> just<00:00:42.550> going<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.879> do

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
and in this video we're just going to do

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.299 
and in this video we're just going to do
two<00:00:43.300> of<00:00:43.449> them<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.559> next<00:00:44.800> video<00:00:45.040> we'll

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
two of them and in the next video we'll

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.310 
two of them and in the next video we'll
do<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.670> other<00:00:45.699> two<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.600> let's<00:00:46.629> start<00:00:47.110> with

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
do the other two so let's start with

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.299 
do the other two so let's start with
smart<00:00:47.769> bench<00:00:48.030> 2012<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.379> let's<00:00:50.559> run<00:00:50.860> the

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
smart bench 2012 so let's run the

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.210 
smart bench 2012 so let's run the
benchmark<00:00:52.239> here<00:00:52.510> hit<00:00:52.839> run<00:00:53.140> smart<00:00:53.710> bench<00:00:53.920> and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
benchmark here hit run smart bench and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.700 
benchmark here hit run smart bench and
it's<00:00:54.850> calculating<00:00:55.449> pi<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:02.379> get<00:01:02.530> some

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
it's calculating pi and we get some

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
it's calculating pi and we get some
graphics<00:01:03.220> here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:23.600 

and<00:01:10.790> we're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> corridor

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:35.260 

and<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.500> executing<00:01:25.500> string<00:01:26.370> tests

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.779 

now<00:01:35.750> i<00:01:35.780> get<00:01:36.020> some<00:01:36.229> fish<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.770> time<00:01:36.829> chased<00:01:37.609> by

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
now i get some fish this time chased by

00:01:37.789 --> 00:02:01.750 
now i get some fish this time chased by
a<00:01:37.820> shark

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.060 

the<00:02:02.120> benchmark<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.750> complete<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.560> let's

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
the benchmark is complete and let's

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.620 
the benchmark is complete and let's
display<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.760> index<00:02:05.150> scores<00:02:05.540> here<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.450> it

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
display the index scores here and it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.450 
display the index scores here and it
looks<00:02:08.840> like<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.470> device<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.010> on<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> top<00:02:10.399> of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
looks like my device is on the top of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.170 
looks like my device is on the top of
the<00:02:10.670> heap<00:02:10.820> up<00:02:11.000> here<00:02:12.580> now<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> don't<00:02:13.730> know<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the heap up here now I don't know if you

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.970 
the heap up here now I don't know if you
can<00:02:14.360> read<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:14.930> I'll<00:02:15.080> read<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.620> it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
can read it but I'll read it to you it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.120 
can read it but I'll read it to you it

gaming index so how does this device
stack<00:02:40.670> up<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.120> your<00:02:41.300> android<00:02:41.720> device<00:02:41.750> all<00:02:42.320> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
stack up to your android device all you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.760 
stack up to your android device all you
need<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:42.980> do<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.220> download<00:02:43.610> smart<00:02:44.600> bench<00:02:44.870> 2012

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
need to do is download smart bench 2012

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.190 
need to do is download smart bench 2012
from<00:02:46.370> google<00:02:46.670> play<00:02:46.700> run<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.750> benchmark

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
from google play run the benchmark

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.560 
from google play run the benchmark
yourself<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.280> how<00:02:49.400> your<00:02:49.700> device<00:02:50.000> stacks

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
yourself and see how your device stacks

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.860 
yourself and see how your device stacks
up<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.080> nexus<00:02:51.410> 7<00:02:52.180> okay<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> next<00:02:53.600> one

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
up to the nexus 7 okay the next one

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.750 
up to the nexus 7 okay the next one
we're<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.380> do<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.890> Lin<00:02:55.760> pack<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.640> we're

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
we're going to do is Lin pack so we're

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.910 
we're going to do is Lin pack so we're
going<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.940> run<00:02:59.150> two<00:02:59.480> tests<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.110> single<00:03:00.650> thread

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
going to run two tests a single thread

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.250 
going to run two tests a single thread
test<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.790> multi<00:03:02.209> thread<00:03:02.510> test<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.080> let's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
test and a multi thread test so let's

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.880 
test and a multi thread test so let's
start<00:03:03.470> with<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.650> single<00:03:04.040> thread<00:03:04.250> test<00:03:04.490> and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
start with a single thread test and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.830 
start with a single thread test and
generally<00:03:06.890> these<00:03:06.980> are<00:03:07.220> pretty<00:03:07.430> quick<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:08.480> has

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
generally these are pretty quick it has

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.720 
generally these are pretty quick it has
40<00:03:09.880> 6.86<00:03:10.880> mega<00:03:11.420> flops<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.770> point<00:03:13.160> seven

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
40 6.86 mega flops in one point seven

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.310 
40 6.86 mega flops in one point seven
nine<00:03:14.209> seconds<00:03:15.110> with<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.739> precision<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.989> 2.2<00:03:17.989> too

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
nine seconds with a precision of 2.2 too

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.580 
nine seconds with a precision of 2.2 too
let's<00:03:19.190> try<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.550> multithread<00:03:20.450> test<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:23.590> we

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
let's try the multithread test and we

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
let's try the multithread test and we
got<00:03:25.450> 95.3<00:03:26.500> 46<00:03:27.500> mega<00:03:27.800> flops<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.489> one<00:03:29.150> point

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
got 95.3 46 mega flops in one point

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.130 
got 95.3 46 mega flops in one point
seven<00:03:30.110> seven<00:03:30.650> seconds<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.570> precision

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
seven seven seconds and the precision

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.030 
seven seven seconds and the precision
was<00:03:33.530> inconsistent<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.410> those<00:03:36.680> are<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.950> couple

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
was inconsistent so those are a couple

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.199 
was inconsistent so those are a couple
of<00:03:37.780> benchmarking<00:03:38.780> apps<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:40.130> Nexus<00:03:40.610> 7

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209
