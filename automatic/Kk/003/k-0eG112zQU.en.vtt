00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
absolutely ridiculous so I'm just gonna

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.099 
absolutely ridiculous so I'm just gonna
jump<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> game<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.600> quick<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.930> way<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
jump in a game really quick that way I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.019 
jump in a game really quick that way I
can<00:00:22.289> talk<00:00:22.500> over<00:00:22.680> something<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.640> fast

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
