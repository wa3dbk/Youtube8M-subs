we have merino sheep sheep are the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.739 
we have merino sheep sheep are the
reason<00:00:13.589> why<00:00:13.740> 1830s<00:00:14.549> agriculture<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.299> at<00:00:15.539> its

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:15.749 
reason why 1830s agriculture is at its

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.470 
reason why 1830s agriculture is at its
peak<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> price<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.640> wool<00:00:17.910> goes

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
peak because the price of wool goes

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.420 
peak because the price of wool goes
through<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> roof<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.350> these<00:00:19.650> textile<00:00:20.190> mills

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.200 

we<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:40.860> sure<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.910> wool<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we need to make sure that the wool is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.410 
we need to make sure that the wool is

carefully with a stick and then I have

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
carefully with a stick and then I have
several<00:00:54.000> rinses<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.379> cooler

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
temperature water and then I end up

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.600 
temperature water and then I end up
actually<00:00:58.409> spinning<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.400> water<00:00:59.610> out<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.970> it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
actually spinning the water out of it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.399 
actually spinning the water out of it
once<00:01:02.610> it's<00:01:02.790> dried<00:01:03.089> it's<00:01:03.329> able<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> carded

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
once it's dried it's able to be carded

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.710 
once it's dried it's able to be carded
which<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> detangling<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.509> world

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which is the detangling of the world

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.710 
which is the detangling of the world
getting<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> ready<00:01:07.259> for<00:01:07.409> spinning<00:01:08.450> when<00:01:09.450> wool

getting it ready for spinning when wool
is<00:01:09.930> hardened<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:12.050> what<00:01:13.050> happens

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
is hardened this is the what happens

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.100 
is hardened this is the what happens
here<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.800> mill<00:01:14.930> essentially<00:01:15.930> what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
here in this mill essentially what

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
here in this mill essentially what
they're<00:01:16.200> doing<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.590> brushing<00:01:16.890> injury<00:01:17.490> you're

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
they're doing is brushing injury you're

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.180 
they're doing is brushing injury you're
brushing<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> fibers<00:01:18.899> out<00:01:19.190> separating

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
brushing all the fibers out separating

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.249 
brushing all the fibers out separating
the<00:01:20.310> Tufts<00:01:20.610> separating<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> dense<00:01:21.690> portions

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the Tufts separating the dense portions

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
the Tufts separating the dense portions
and<00:01:22.440> making<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.160> fibers<00:01:23.520> face<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.940> same

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and making all the fibers face the same

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.529 
and making all the fibers face the same
direction<00:01:24.470> what<00:01:25.470> happens<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.399> they<00:01:27.179> they

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
direction what happens then is they they

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.260 
direction what happens then is they they
can<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.869> twisted<00:01:28.410> together<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.250> spun<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:30.090> make

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
can be twisted together or spun to make

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.130 
can be twisted together or spun to make
a<00:01:30.300> yarn<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.229> thread<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> yarn<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> mitad

a yarn or thread the yarn would be mitad

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
a yarn or thread the yarn would be mitad
into<00:01:34.560> whatever<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.640> want

hats sweaters gloves one could easily

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
hats sweaters gloves one could easily
dye<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> wool<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:43.979> putting<00:01:44.220> into<00:01:44.580> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
dye the wool and actually putting into a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.570 
dye the wool and actually putting into a
pot<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.599> dive<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.039> colors<00:01:47.039> actually<00:01:47.459> been

pot of a dive that colors actually been

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.460 
pot of a dive that colors actually been
extracted<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.179> plant<00:01:48.569> materials<00:01:49.020> there's<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
extracted from plant materials there's a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
extracted from plant materials there's a
lot<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:50.009> stuff<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.789> see<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.149> actually

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
lot of little stuff to see so actually

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.339 
lot of little stuff to see so actually
we've<00:01:51.479> been<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.780> frantically<00:01:52.200> running

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
we've been like frantically running

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.620 
we've been like frantically running
around<00:01:52.530> trying<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.979> catch<00:01:53.160> everything<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
around trying to catch everything and I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.059 
around trying to catch everything and I
was<00:01:54.690> really<00:01:54.899> happy<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.349> got<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.679> do<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
was really happy that I got to do the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.440 
was really happy that I got to do the
drop<00:01:56.250> spindle<00:01:56.550> activities<00:01:56.970> if<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.209> knitter

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
drop spindle activities if I'm a knitter

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.080 
drop spindle activities if I'm a knitter
so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.709> is<00:01:58.860> fun<00:01:59.099> this<00:01:59.880> is
