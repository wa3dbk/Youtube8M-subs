demolished right now this ship was very

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
demolished right now this ship was very
fun<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.809> build<00:00:58.050> due<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> fact<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.399> has

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
fun to build due to the fact that it has

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.190 
fun to build due to the fact that it has
stepped<00:01:00.469> on<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.940> first<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.750> little

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
stepped on it first of all the little

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.149 
stepped on it first of all the little
studs<00:01:07.200> here

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
studs here

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.980 
studs here
those<00:01:08.850> serve<00:01:09.780> house<00:01:10.200> balconies<00:01:10.890> for

go<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.259> center<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> ship<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
go down to the center of the ship and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.990 
go down to the center of the ship and
then<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:22.549> balconies<00:01:23.549> here

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
then you got some more balconies here

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
then you got some more balconies here
and<00:01:24.560> then<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:27.350> like<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.220> well

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and then you have like so that's well

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
and then you have like so that's well
obviously<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.900> could<00:01:31.079> count<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.890> it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
obviously you could count them they it's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.390 
obviously you could count them they it's
like<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.820> two<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.720> four<00:01:34.470> five<00:01:36.229> six<00:01:37.400> seven

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
eight nine levels um of the ship that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.030 
eight nine levels um of the ship that
are<00:01:43.680> clearly<00:01:44.009> visible<00:01:45.560> um<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.350> fun

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
are clearly visible um it was a very fun

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.039 
are clearly visible um it was a very fun
build<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> couple<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.869> challenges<00:01:52.170> um

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
build it had a couple of challenges um

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.749 
build it had a couple of challenges um
so<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.079> trying<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.280> accurate<00:01:57.500> to

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
so just trying to get it as accurate to

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
so just trying to get it as accurate to
the<00:01:59.759> ship<00:02:00.149> itself<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.500> um<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:03.329> liking<00:02:03.630> as

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the ship itself but um to my liking as

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
the ship itself but um to my liking as
well<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:07.350> yeah<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:07.979> much<00:02:08.369> enjoyed

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
well but yeah I very much enjoyed

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.169 
well but yeah I very much enjoyed
building<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
building this

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.709 
building this
a<00:02:11.400> second<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.420> another

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
a second is you just have another

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:18.030 
a second is you just have another
regular<00:02:14.170> cruise<00:02:14.469> ship<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:16.439> have<00:02:17.439> a<00:02:17.590> fewer

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
regular cruise ship you have a fewer

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.369 
regular cruise ship you have a fewer
balconies<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:18.909> this<00:02:19.209> too<00:02:19.659> due<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> fact

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
balconies on this too due to the fact

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.470 
balconies on this too due to the fact
that<00:02:20.469> you<00:02:20.650> have<00:02:21.359> like<00:02:22.359> two<00:02:22.810> hallways<00:02:23.079> here

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that you have like two hallways here

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.640 
that you have like two hallways here
with<00:02:25.480> um<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.739> deck<00:02:27.659> above<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.870> sort<00:02:29.379> of<00:02:29.439> like<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
with um a deck above it sort of like a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.280 
with um a deck above it sort of like a
walking<00:02:29.920> deck<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:32.109> boat

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
walking deck and then you have the boat

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.209 
walking deck and then you have the boat
deck<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.920> everything<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.439> this<00:02:35.439> is<00:02:35.500> fun<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
deck and everything and this is fun to

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.550 
deck and everything and this is fun to
build<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.969> it's<00:02:37.689> not<00:02:37.870> modeled<00:02:38.409> after

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
build but it's not modeled after

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.500 
build but it's not modeled after
anything<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.340> didn't<00:02:39.549> put<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:39.819> much<00:02:39.969> detail

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
anything I didn't put as much detail

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.009 
anything I didn't put as much detail
into<00:02:41.099> into<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.280> um<00:02:45.209> yeah

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.369 

this<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.470> bigger<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:52.169> much<00:02:53.169> more

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
this one is bigger and much more

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.890 
this one is bigger and much more
accurate<00:02:53.620> when<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.549> comes<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.090> being<00:02:55.450> designed

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
accurate when it comes to being designed

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.979 
accurate when it comes to being designed
after<00:02:56.200> something<00:02:56.620> did<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.519> really<00:02:57.700> just

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
after something did that really just

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:09.179

designed after European shuttle that you
runs<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.169> English<00:03:35.560> Channel<00:03:37.919> yeah<00:03:38.919> a

little<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.239> was<00:03:40.419> a<00:03:40.449> difficult<00:03:40.720> build

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
little this was a difficult build

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.729 
little this was a difficult build
actually<00:03:41.470> due<00:03:42.009> to<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.280> fact<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.579> three<00:03:43.299> wide

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
actually due to the fact that three wide

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.439 
actually due to the fact that three wide
instead<00:03:44.739> of<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.159> four<00:03:45.400> wide<00:03:45.669> but<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.000> wanted<00:03:46.299> it

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
instead of the four wide but I wanted it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.619 
instead of the four wide but I wanted it
to<00:03:46.659> be<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.680> little<00:03:48.159> bit<00:03:48.400> scaled<00:03:48.939> more

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
to be a little bit scaled more

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:56.159 
to be a little bit scaled more
accurately<00:03:50.229> little<00:03:50.859> better<00:03:53.519> yeah<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:56.079> a

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
accurately little better yeah just a

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.619 
accurately little better yeah just a
different<00:03:56.560> size<00:03:56.919> Shep<00:03:57.639> I<00:03:57.879> was<00:03:58.180> getting<00:03:58.479> tired

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
different size Shep I was getting tired

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.210 
different size Shep I was getting tired
of<00:03:58.930> building<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.470> little<00:03:59.709> before<00:04:00.129> wide<00:04:01.000> chips

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
of building the little before wide chips

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.749 
of building the little before wide chips
so<00:04:03.220> then<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.519> have<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.819> port<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:06.509> the

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
so then you have the port here the

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.030 
so then you have the port here the
boardwalk<00:04:09.759> goes<00:04:10.299> down<00:04:10.599> here<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:12.009> a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
boardwalk goes down here this is a

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.580 
boardwalk goes down here this is a
boardwalk<00:04:12.430> then<00:04:13.389> you<00:04:13.540> go<00:04:13.689> down<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.379> wider

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
boardwalk then you go down to the wider

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.320 
boardwalk then you go down to the wider
port<00:04:15.069> right<00:04:15.519> here<00:04:17.880> moorings<00:04:19.079> for<00:04:20.079> large
