00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.259

 this campaign to youtube invites us to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 make video letters addressed to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 ourselves when we were younger and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 to share letters in this video 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 our past fears and ours 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.250
 current wisdom with the aim of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 inspire and power the new generations e 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.860
 young women 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.059
 and all this begins with two words 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 tell me then number one carabini roxy 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 don't take everything so seriously 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 it's okay to study and it's okay to be a little 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 nerd but if you take a bad grade 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.500
 it's not the end of the world 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 so do n't stress yourself out 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.219
 come anxiety don't let you come 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.649
 panic attacks and above all not 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 cry for that 4 in math laid 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 everyone will forget about six 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.879
 months including you and the teacher e 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.229
 which in a few years will not have 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 no importance 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.250
 also if that person doesn't want to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 be your friend and don't want to talk to you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's not the end of the world let it be 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 these are not the two true friends are 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 only people who like to do a lot 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 of Rome and who want to attract 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.700
 the attention of your true years 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 those who want to talk to you want 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.340
 be your friends and don't do all of them 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 these scenes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.600
 also don't be afraid of being you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.150
 same one hundred percent already six 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.799
 she realized she was different from thinking about it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.350
 otherwise to want to dress you 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.960
 otherwise to have different interests 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 etc. and surely you are not one of them 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 he wants to homologate to all the others though 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 you do n't say what you think one hundred percent 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 you don't dress a hundred percent 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 how would you like not to share the things that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 you like them a hundred percent because 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 you're afraid of being judged 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.149
 the truth is that it serves 60 per 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.490
 hundred and this thing is not good because 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.280
 number 1 this will limit you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.350
 feel kind of trapped in a lot 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.450
 time and I could not be happy at 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.340
 one hundred percent if you are not yourself e 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.869
 if you do not express yourself one hundred per cent 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940
 percent and number two 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.340
 yours 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 veins and things that make you different 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 they are the ones that will take you where you are 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.940
 now it 's great 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 also don't be afraid to do things that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.880
 no one does follow your heart follow the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.170
 your instinct 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.020

 you want to study dance study dance not 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.850
 choose a school address a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.100
 high school or a faculty that is a bit 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.000
 so scientific and a little artistic so 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.980
 everyone happy 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.210
 because if it's not something you like at 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.030
 hundred percent 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.980
 you will hate it with the passage of time 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.930
 said between us you know you should do 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.450
 you should study film photography or 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.460
 animation because they are held a few years 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.110
 that's what you'll like to do 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.880
 then follow the hundredth instinct for 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.880
 hundred and not try to please him 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.650
 others also it's ok to change your mind 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.890
 will change your mind about what you want to do from 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.690
 big and so many times and it's ok not 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.540
 you must and cannot plan all yours 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.490
 life at the age of 13 15 years 18 years 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.230
 20 years some people understand that 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.120
 who want to do at 30 years 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.000
 also because you never know what that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.820
 it will happen then change your mind ok not you 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.600

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.739
 a video letter to inspire not only 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.050
 young women but in general new ones 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.600
 generations because maybe it's true that 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.600
 statistically, girls tend to 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.030
 to make oneself more complex and mental blowjobs of the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.370
 boys but I'm sure they are in 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.840
 around the boys they need 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.510
 to be told these things 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.310
 therefore officially live the permission 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.250

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.790
