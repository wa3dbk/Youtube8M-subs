Welcome to the office of Pro Evolution Soccer fans

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.860
Today we will see the different aspects of ball control

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.251
a case well known by Pro Evolution Soccer's fans

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.260
If you encounter difficulties with ball control,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.936
fails with Super Cancel,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.280
or a weak first ball touch

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.740
So this tutorial is for you !

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.400
Doctor Choco you are expected for an emergency in room 98

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.360
an other noob thinking that he was playing Kick off

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.400
So what do we have here, psychomotric missteps also known as "Shittus Controlus"

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:46.303
So Mister Minanda, how do you feel ?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.280
Bad, very bad, got my ass kicked

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.040
olalalalala...

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.340
Well...it happens to everyone

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Told us what happened

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.060
I was leading 2-0, a 2 confortable lead, my opponent couldn't move a stick

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.920
Then this long pass just showed up from...

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500
Chest control skill ?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.600
Yes, that's it, how do you know doctor ?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.500
Classic case, please keep on

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.160
Then he used Super Cancel,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.580
Fake shot, fake body

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.300
I took everything from the expert bastard

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.760

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.720
Mersey

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.620
Side

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.300
Red

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.440
I think he's lagging

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.300
Of course he's lagging, look at his face !

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.280
What the report says ?

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.140
Well he has a very bad video game health doctor

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.820
His victory / defeat ratio worries me while he only plays with cheating teams

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.740
and this data says to us that he got all the forward pass symptoms

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.040
Mister Castolo...

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.960
Mi-nan-da

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.540
Real Madrid ?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.820
Yes...yes...

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940
Ok... to the operating block

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160
Ok...we will play it safe...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.000
Dual Shocks please

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.500
Diagnostic please ?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.260
Our patient seems to be suffering from a metacarpus squint

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.880
Ok...what would you do ?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.880
First we will look closely on ball control situations

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.820
on the ground

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.660
then in the air

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.100
and we will finish with a dribbling control dissection

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.340
anything else ?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.980
Super Cancel

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.780
Super Cancel

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440
Hey guys we're losing him !

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.500
Do something, do something !

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.720
How do you control and keep the ball ?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.800
In PES, the first touch is very important

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.160
If you're not focused while receiving the ball you will make some mistakes

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.700
Don't forget to use the R2 button when you receive the ball

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.100
a right footed player will make a better control with the ball and same for a left footed

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.080
Music

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.180
How do you make differents ball control ?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.000
Here is a question that come back in force every year in PES : how to make differents controls with the ball ?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.800
Picking the ball allow you to be deadly in the penalty box, and to beat your opponents in central midfield

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.180
Too much pressure doctor, i can't do it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.080
maybe but PES is like real life, you got to show some guts

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.120
so to make a long ball control

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.080
just hold the left stick in any direction you want

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.300
and press the R1 button when taking the ball

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.940
To make a short ball control just hold the left stick in the direction you want when receiving the ball

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.880
and for advanced players you can make a specific ball control

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.260
with holding the left stick while pressing R3 Button when you got the ball

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.123
you see, you did great

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.206
Compress !

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.700
How to control the ball in the air ?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.800
A good chest control offers to physical strickers the chance to be deadly in the goal area

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.640
with some good players you can also make a  chest control and  a dribbling skill

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.580
to make a short chest control be careful to be at the right distance from the ball

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.280
and to make a chest control with a quick second touch

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.180
be at the right distance and push quickly the R3 Button while the ball is still in the air

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.300
timing must be perfect or else you will loose the ball

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.960
To control the ball while your player is still running

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.840
just move your player toward the ball and if

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.000
his dribbling stat is good, he will push his leg forward to catch it

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.520
How to fake a ball control ?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.640
Against aggressive players you can fake your ball control

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.560
to do so just hold the right stick in a direction before receiving the ball

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.760
then activate your dribbling control just after with the left stick (hold) by choising a direction

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.980
as you can see the right stick is for the ball direction

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.120
and the left stick is for the body direction

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.400
you can also let the ball go through your legs by holding L1 and R1 buttons

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.040

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.640

in front of the attack, it allows you to anticipate a pass and beat your opponent

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.840
in defense you can anticipate for a forward pass

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.320
and during the match, the Super Cancel tips allows you to let the ball go out the field

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.460
