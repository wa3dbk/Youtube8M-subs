00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello good morning and welcome to a 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.310
 of video response sessions o 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.710
 any comments on yours 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.240
 requests you made on the site from 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.900
 school from the Italian track is so much that 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.950
 we do not see each other 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.140
 but today I wanted to take the opportunity to 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:28.570
 answer some comments that I have 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.000
 is moved by some 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.819
 elusive he believes he is a 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.949
 pizzaiolo and in any case always the 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:39.399
 thanks to the many people 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:43.530
 that compliments us on the 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.609
 notions we give especially for the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.309
 training that we carry out at the 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.179
 our offices 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.359
 I must clearly disagree with more than 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:00.219
 some statement that is made on the 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:02.049
 fact that we don't understand anything about repeaters 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.780
 never facts prove it and I wanted 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.360
 just make some clarifications I have 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.520
 already done on video of high pizza 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.439
 digestibility that has already been published 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.689
 a long time ago and that anyway a 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.450
 video purely for demonstration purposes 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.000
 speaks of digestibility and I turn to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.549
 those people who believe they are 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.590
 prepared and then maybe I'll do a 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.109
 small example of someone you are 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.600
 presented by making statements a 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.700
 nothing short of ridiculous even scandalous but 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.490
 they are synonymous with little preparation 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.799
 I renew the invitation to those who want to be 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.409
 really prepared to address one 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.909
 of the structures that are there in all 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.070
 italy there is someone want can do it 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.539
 with us otherwise we can 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 turn to other professionals of 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.960
 sector because I assure you that there is one 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.460
 really many 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.890
 unlike what you can 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.619
 believe as there are so many of them 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.179
 people who are absolutely not 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.840
 prepared and performing the job of 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.250
 pizzaiolo 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.180
 one of these is 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.740
 an unidentified who writes and you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.250
 you're a pizza maker, shut up, it's better 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.200
 electric oven semolina but you have to do 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.990
 the caramico biscuits the real pizza is made 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.990
 with hard type 00 flour and with the oven a 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.000
 Neapolitan wood leavening live 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 for those who can do it according to tradition or 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 k not to say that that is a pizza e 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.300
 I forgot fiordilatte agro 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.260
 nocerino and san marzano tomatoes this 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.050
 person did not say absolutely 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.709
 not bad here you can clearly see the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.410
 absolute lack of preparation and 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.930
 phantom the imaginary way of 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.080
 prepare the pizza just so randomly 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.730
 then first in love electric oven 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.410
 that I better recommend it only with 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.300
 a practical matter then later for 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.590
 regarding the use of sound 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.959
 electric the wood swan to the frond 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.250
 gas must be prepared and know 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.860
 the characteristics of cooking that 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 this person obviously does not know 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.540
 then the semolina comes lately 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.130
 used by several to several 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.290
 good of saioni for the drafting of the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.360
 track for a question of result 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.980
 at the end of crunchiness but this does not 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.959
 it means that you have to spend to do 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.850
 things with themselves but the question of 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.340
 personal choice then it makes me a little 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.720
 smile the real pizza is made with flour 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.880
 00 kind lasts then the flour dear friend 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.920
 the one that belongs to the category belongs 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.640
 clearly use to make pizza 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.150
 common wheat flour and not type flour 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.620
 lasts 00 is the grinding degree for 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.829
 who did not know it because it exists there 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.000
 also the type 0 with double zero integral 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.620
 the 1 to 2 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.840
 but you have to be prepared on these 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.360
 things here and then know the w the escort 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 of flour to make a good one 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.980
 dough does not exist anyway 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.079
 direct leavening dear friend but it is the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.269
 type of dough that direct or 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.790
 indirect that I think you don't even know 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.650
 how to do leavening is part of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.870
 maturation process that is everything 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.400
 special procedure dear friend 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.230
 since you don't know it anyway 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.299
 you should inform and above all 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.880
 prepare as usual here 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.980
 preparation and then the thread fiordilatte 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.530
 good is found in all regions 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.780
 of Italy do not necessarily go 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.260
 in the south they are also in the north there is between 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.870
 etc 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.540
 and then the San Marzano tomatoes goes well on 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.640
 this I can agree because 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.880
 San Marzano tomatoes are still not 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.880
 milled past and should be passed to 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.560
 hand just before making pizza in 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.750
 this case so to speak stuffed 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.210
 practicality the pulp of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.630
 blessed tomato this renew my 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.000
 invite them to prepare them 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.720
 prepare them more and more and be 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.060
 above all words of pizza makers 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.000
 prepared because quality must be given e 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.370
 quality people are right to learn 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.860
 to appreciate not like these people 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.720
 who sometimes write believe of 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.180
 be good only to write about 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.310
 facebook four news but they are not 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.800
 absolutely truthful of people 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.110

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.190
 relevant questions 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.800
 make the people prepared who do not 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.900
 were it anyway get yourself a little course 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.680
 training and goodbye 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.680
