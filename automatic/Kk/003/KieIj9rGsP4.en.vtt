here<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.550> leads<00:00:47.760> onto<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> big<00:00:48.270> question

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
here that leads onto the big question

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
here that leads onto the big question
everyone<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.200> asking<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.579> suck<00:00:50.850> blood

everyone is asking do they suck blood
tell<00:00:51.660> us<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> answer<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.290> yes<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.000> cannot<00:00:54.000> tell

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
tell us the answer is yes I cannot tell

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
tell us the answer is yes I cannot tell
you<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> answers<00:00:54.750> no<00:00:55.140> 100<00:00:55.710> sample<00:00:56.070> it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you the answers no 100 sample it's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.280 
you the answers no 100 sample it's
pretty<00:00:56.640> unlikely<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.540> do<00:00:57.719> suck<00:00:58.020> blood

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
pretty unlikely that they do suck blood

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.650 
pretty unlikely that they do suck blood
it's<00:00:59.070> probably<00:00:59.550> related<00:01:00.030> somehow<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.450> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's probably related somehow to the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's probably related somehow to the
fact<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.930> they're<00:01:01.079> live<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.289> such<00:01:01.620> small

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
fact that they're live in such small

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.850 
fact that they're live in such small
bodies<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.489> water<00:01:02.700> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> tree<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:03.930> maybe

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
bodies of water in the tree so maybe

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
bodies of water in the tree so maybe
they<00:01:05.009> eat<00:01:05.129> something<00:01:05.489> strange<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.960> them

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
they eat something strange or use them

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
they eat something strange or use them
for<00:01:07.350> cooking<00:01:07.619> onto<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> tree<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.460> something

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
for cooking onto the tree or something

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640 
for cooking onto the tree or something
like<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.630> whole<00:01:09.869> vampire

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
for them the flying thing it's quite apt

that that group of frogs that they
belong<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> called<00:01:31.530> flying<00:01:31.950> frog<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.820> not

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
belong to a called flying frog it's not

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
belong to a called flying frog it's not
because<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.479> flappin<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.320> fly<00:01:34.530> off<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
because they flappin and fly off of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
because they flappin and fly off of
trades<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.390> webbing

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
trades but they do have this webbing

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
trades but they do have this webbing
between<00:01:37.470> their<00:01:37.979> hands<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.490> toes<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.479> do

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
between their hands and toes and they do

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
between their hands and toes and they do
glide<00:01:40.130> from<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.670> called<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
glide from well they also called the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
glide from well they also called the
parachuting<00:01:42.630> frogs<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.140> basically<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
parachuting frogs so basically they can

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.200 
parachuting frogs so basically they can
jump<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.280> branch<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> branch<00:01:44.729> without

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
jump from branch to branch without

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030

question<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:48.210> did<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.659> find

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
question is how did you actually find

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
question is how did you actually find
this<00:01:49.380> frog<00:01:50.030> well<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.450> tend<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.829> cool

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this frog well we tend to look for cool

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.450 
this frog well we tend to look for cool
new<00:01:53.579> species<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.030> frogs<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.540> mountains<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.460> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
new species of frogs in mountains and so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
new species of frogs in mountains and so
I<00:01:56.490> spend<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.970> my<00:01:57.060> time<00:01:57.240> climbing<00:01:57.780> up

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I spend one of my time climbing up

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.950 
I spend one of my time climbing up
mountains<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.560> colleagues<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.040> Vietnam

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
mountains with my colleagues in Vietnam

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.420 
mountains with my colleagues in Vietnam
so<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.229> was<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> southern<00:02:01.860> highlands<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
so this was in the southern highlands of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
so this was in the southern highlands of
Vietnam<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.020> fly<00:02:04.530> there

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
Vietnam so we can get as I fly there

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.580 
Vietnam so we can get as I fly there
first<00:02:04.979> obviously<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> car<00:02:07.560> or

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
first obviously then we get a car or

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
first obviously then we get a car or
motorbikes<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.729> far<00:02:08.909> as<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.299> go<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.779> then

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
motorbikes as far as we can go and then

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.720 
motorbikes as far as we can go and then
it's<00:02:10.499> on<00:02:10.709> foot<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.309> basically<00:02:11.760> climbing

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it's on foot and basically climbing

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.949 
it's on foot and basically climbing
Mountains<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.239> was<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.629> easier

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
Mountains this that was a little easier

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.410 
Mountains this that was a little easier
than<00:02:14.140> most<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.459> usually<00:02:15.790> does<00:02:15.970> involve

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
than most but it usually does involve

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.630 
than most but it usually does involve
carrying<00:02:16.840> everything<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.830> need<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.400> couple

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
carrying everything we need for a couple

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.149 
carrying everything we need for a couple
of<00:02:18.730> weeks<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.269> our<00:02:19.330> backs<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.080> climbing<00:02:21.069> off

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
of weeks on our backs and climbing off

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.979 
of weeks on our backs and climbing off
mountain<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.610> there's<00:02:21.790> usually<00:02:21.940> no<00:02:22.209> paths<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
mountain and there's usually no paths so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.660 
mountain and there's usually no paths so
you<00:02:23.170> saying<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> life<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.069> scientists

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
you saying that the life of scientists

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.399 
you saying that the life of scientists
is<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.150> glamorous<00:02:25.299> as<00:02:25.629> might<00:02:25.959> have<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> be

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
is not as glamorous as might have to be

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.949 
is not as glamorous as might have to be
I<00:02:27.190> don't<00:02:27.940> know<00:02:28.150> that's<00:02:28.420> that's<00:02:28.720> pretty

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I don't know that's that's pretty

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.830 
I don't know that's that's pretty
exciting<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.680> mean<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.519> part<00:02:30.940> where<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.269> sit<00:02:31.599> in

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
exciting I mean this part where I sit in

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.570 
exciting I mean this part where I sit in
a<00:02:31.959> chair<00:02:31.989> in<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.799> office<00:02:33.129> looking<00:02:33.400> down<00:02:33.549> a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
a chair in the office looking down a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.729 
a chair in the office looking down a
microscope<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> computer<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.049> probably

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
microscope and on a computer is probably

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.890 
microscope and on a computer is probably
I<00:02:35.920> guess<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.819> more<00:02:36.970> glamorous<00:02:37.420> than<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
I guess it is more glamorous than the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.420 
I guess it is more glamorous than the
alternative<00:02:38.379> which<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.500> covered<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:38.980> liters

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
alternative which is covered in liters

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.520 
alternative which is covered in liters
in<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.670> forest<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.870> then<00:02:41.049> you've<00:02:41.260> climbed

in the forest so and then you've climbed

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.899 
in the forest so and then you've climbed
through<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.920> mountains<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.310> how'd<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.670> find

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909
