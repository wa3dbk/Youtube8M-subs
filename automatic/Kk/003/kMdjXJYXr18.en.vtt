coins and you gains like seven games are

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.600 
coins and you gains like seven games are
over<00:01:15.479> anywhere<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.049> didn't<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.259> matter

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
over anywhere so it didn't really matter

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.469 
over anywhere so it didn't really matter
so<00:01:17.610> after<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> we've<00:01:18.119> lost<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.450> a

so after that we've lost to be a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.640 
so after that we've lost to be a
chemistry<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.500> some

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
chemistry that could have to get some
