00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.800
 Harry, take care of yourself. 

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:15.226
 Be strong. 

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:19.067
 Every moment he lives ... 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.288
 Harry Potter. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.014
 ... dragged him here. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 You fought bravely. 

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.500
 Now join me ... 

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.603
 ... and get face to face. 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.622
 You kept her alive so she could die at the right moment? 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.150
 Bring him to me. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 Let's find out where he is. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.300
 If we do, we can put an end to this. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 I say we jump. Now! 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.300
 On July 15th ... 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.700
 Hogwarts are under threat ... 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 ... do not leave the boundaries empty, protect us. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.550
 ...everything... 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.988
 I have to go back, right? 

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.780
 It's a suicide mission. 

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:14.498
 ... where it started. 

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:18.428
 The surviving child ... 

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:21.799
 ... to die. 

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:30.851
 Tell me what happened that night. 

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:32.718
 A person who trusts you ... 

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.656
 ... how you look at your eyes ... 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 ... and how you killed him. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.570
 I didn't want any of you to die for me. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 Will you stay with me? 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.900
 Always. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.964
 Till the end. 

00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:48.711
 No! 

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:53.713
 Come on, Tom. Let's end this way ... 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.050
 ...together. 

00:01:58.678 --> 00:01:59.243
 The last battle ... 

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:01.813
 ...here. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 Only I can live forever. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.500
