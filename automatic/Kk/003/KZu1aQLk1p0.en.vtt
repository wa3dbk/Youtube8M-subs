00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.260
 There are two things that I have to ask you 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.570
 but I need a short answer and 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.279
 concise and clear and criticized for that 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.980
 you said is that those who were demonstrating 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.090
 against the cuts were ugly you want 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.020
 clarify that good truth then 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.530
 we enter into older words man not 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.300
 is that it's not that said there's a way 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.239
 possibly I am an actor of 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.680
 comedians the way my is always 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.260
 of 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.800
 when speaking is the problem of comedies and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.220
 They do not know get my sense of humor as 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.220
 then you can sit badly but not what 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.400
 doubt that in that moment where 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.390
 this government this government the lord 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.150
 rajoy that by the way is a government that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 you have to stop working there to see if 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.740
 meets the program is not something like that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.290
 program is not not that it fulfills something is that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.299
 is doing a lot but in the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.759
 hole they have left us is very 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.920
 difficult to come out that yes that is true 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.789
 then it takes time 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.859
 coming out but tell me about the uglies 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.630
 very well how to explain yourself in that 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.020
 then when when this government 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.649
 took only 78 months , he put a 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.679
 general strike no no and then if they are 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.560
 ugly are not ugly are ugly even by 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.439
 I'm very sorry 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.959
 but it's an expression because it does not have 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.350
 no matter what I would have 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:48.560
 pretended is that at this moment we are going 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.810
 to join us a little bit more all and leave 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.929
 from this story that we're going we're 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.229
 coming out in the tunnel is already seeing 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.720
 the clarity we are coming out that you 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.450
 I was going to say for three months 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.840
 it is possible that unemployment has fallen 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.269
 yes in 5 people 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.269
 has not come down and has gone down 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.550
 it had been many years since there was 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.160
 we indicate 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 so much tourism like now and the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.380
 tourism forever to the sites that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.150
 there is truly tranquility and there is 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.430
 discipline and there's order we have to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.070
 finish arturo because if you do not want 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 I want to tell you the only thing I want 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.530
 tell you is that all the words all 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.280
 depend on how they are said and how 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.700
 interpret I am a person who 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.070
 I have never asked any government anything 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 I'm not going to tell you anything I do not know 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.790
 absolutely no one from pp except to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.110

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.640

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.110

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.410
