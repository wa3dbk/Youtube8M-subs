00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.490
 we were in the school educational center 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.920
 aysén there we were cameras and microphones 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.290
 of the kitsch we were there and good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.279
 They put together an exhibition that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.270
 title the zoo animals but 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.850
 they learned to make chips 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.109
 IT companies without information sheets 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.480
 you want to see what it's about there 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.480
 we were Czech pop revives 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.809
 and for being here with us 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.359
 sharing work with children 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.610
 for you and for all the public that we 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.360
 come in your program 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.550
 because they come to me like jim likes 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.010
 play sing and enjoy with my tail 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.530
 my note 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 I love them 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.610
 as you can see today this topic is 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 he handled in the Spanish book about 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 expository texts we had to talk 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.880
 about the zoo animals in this 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.250
 case we focus more on the animals 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.830
 of the zoo in the children did with 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.780
 your own creativity and these models 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.630
 that you can observe here and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.590
 we share with all your audience 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.899
 there are certain zoo animals and the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.710
 way they made it too 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.840
 they made some information sheets like 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.869
 you can see here there are some animals that 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.869
 with their same creativity they 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.869
 elaborated 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 many editors happy here why is it 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.799
 the animal that tastes the most 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 the dolphin hears placical for what we 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.579
 they serve this in what places or places 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.060
 use informative sites in the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.060
 zoo in museums or exhibitions 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.740
 through this work of the texts 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.720
 exhibition to the children they learned to 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.610
 make models with cuts 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 which brings the Spanish book like you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.980
 you can observe here they had to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.459
 cut out and with your own creativity 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 elaborate these models and we also saw 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.730
 how they can do certain 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.520
 questions so they can elaborate the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.760
 information sheets those questions that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.239
 they did they were 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.099
 what they eat when they are born where they live 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.540
 is physically and all 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.849
 features to know about the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.030
 animals in this case we focus 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:02.940
 about the zoo animals 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:07.730
 they come to me I like to play sing 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.180
 and enjoy welcome 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.549
 when singing 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.709
 their models are also not me 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.630
 tell us what the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.960
 expository texts or information sheets 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.960
 of the animals the plants and the flowers 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.360
 so so 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 points out 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.190
 to 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.420
 many of them are 16 years old and they 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.060
 They had creativity as I can 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.490
 mention of making these models and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.170
 you can observe the goal of that 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.600
 work that the children understood 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.180
 which are the expository and 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310
 how can they elaborate 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.350
 we could see that the children understood 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.090
 that the 16 positives through these 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.519
 Positive texts can search 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.620
 information in any book either 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.430
 Internet in natural sciences or 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.430
 encyclopedias 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.970
 I do not know 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.640
 now 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.100
 I like to comment today 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.910
 what are the questions to elaborate 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.910
 an information sheet 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.520
 they live as they are physically comfortable 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.980
 and they saw little friends who eat where 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.630
 live how they are born how long they live and 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.830
 how are they physically what is the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.830
 animal that you like the most 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.880
 which one do you like the most? 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.110
 the dolphin is father see that father and 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.980
 here in our fourth torrent for k 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.320
 hector today hector plática me this where 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.830
 in contrast or where we can find 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.120
 information to make cards in 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:29.740
 internet encyclopedias 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.740
 shots of nature 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.879
 also apply losses 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.879
 yes 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.930
 I think that this topic was very 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.569
 interesting for both children and 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.300
 for us because they already through 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.819
 of this he understands more what is the are 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.499
 the expository texts the learning is 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.089
 acquired through stimuli I think 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.499
 that through this as children 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.379
 they learned about these texts 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:17.990
 exhibitions and they were also the 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.819
 creativity to be able to do those jobs 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.439
 as you can see here and the 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.960
 little children too that maybe through 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:27.349
 of your program are being watched by the 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.409
 advice I can give is that children 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:33.050
 in my students they could understand that 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.569
 it is important to take care of the animals and 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.969
 that thanks to these models of 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.159
 zoo they could observe them that 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.560
 there are animals that are in danger of 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:45.080
 disappear they also made some 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.300
 this one posters where they put 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.770
 make people aware of how they should 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.770
 treat them to animals 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.600
 congratulations congratulations to miss anna la 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.000

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.490

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.160
 little house already saw learning how to 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.289
 Acquires through learning to handle 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.380
 expositive pieces information sheets 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.990
 the kids learn to know what is a 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.850
 zoo the different animals and a 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.340
 very nice work that our
