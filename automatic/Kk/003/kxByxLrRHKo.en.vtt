I'm actually so excited to show you guys

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'm actually so excited to show you guys
this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> don't<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:05.970> something

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this is I don't know it's not something

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550 
this is I don't know it's not something
I've<00:01:06.299> ever<00:01:06.390> seen<00:01:06.630> anyone<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> before

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I've ever seen anyone think of before

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
I've ever seen anyone think of before
and<00:01:07.920> um<00:01:08.900> although<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> difficult

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and um although it would be a difficult

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
and um although it would be a difficult
route<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> hit<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.490> you'll<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
route to hit because you'll see the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
route to hit because you'll see the
Reaper<00:01:12.299> only<00:01:12.570> last<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.140> minute<00:01:13.409> or

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Reaper only last for about a minute or

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.539 
Reaper only last for about a minute or
so<00:01:13.830> um<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.960> don't<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:17.189> crazy

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so um I don't know it is something crazy

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
so um I don't know it is something crazy
unique<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.080> look

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
unique and I think would just look

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
unique and I think would just look
awesome<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.680> phil<00:01:19.920> gramm<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.640> definitely

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
awesome in phil gramm so i definitely

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
awesome in phil gramm so i definitely
worth<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> i'd<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.250> online<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.670> you
