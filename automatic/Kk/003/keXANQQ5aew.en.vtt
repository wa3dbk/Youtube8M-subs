00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
pulling this apart I'm going to go ahead

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.380 
pulling this apart I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:05.740> take<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> look<00:02:06.159> at<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.460> wiring<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.150> see

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
and take a look at this wiring and see

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.820 
and take a look at this wiring and see
if<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.570> can<00:02:07.750> find<00:02:07.960> anything<00:02:08.200> where<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.649> wires

years<00:02:54.010> old<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.670> coil<00:02:54.910> went<00:02:55.150> out<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.510> I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
years old and the coil went out and I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.840 
years old and the coil went out and I
said<00:02:56.140> guess<00:02:56.320> what<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.829> have<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.430> bench<00:02:57.670> of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
said guess what I have on my bench of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.810 
said guess what I have on my bench of
snowblower<00:02:58.299> that's<00:02:58.900> four<00:02:59.230> years<00:02:59.260> old<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.950> the

snowblower that's four years old and the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.810 
snowblower that's four years old and the
coil<00:03:01.120> went<00:03:01.390> out<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.170> I'll<00:03:02.829> be<00:03:03.040> replacing<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
coil went out so I'll be replacing that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.670 
coil went out so I'll be replacing that
and<00:03:04.060> I'll<00:03:04.660> get<00:03:04.840> back<00:03:05.049> with<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.530> an

updated okay so I've been waiting for
some<00:03:08.290> parts<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.430> think<00:03:09.670> they<00:03:09.760> came<00:03:09.970> in<00:03:10.180> so

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
some parts and I think they came in so

some parts and I think they came in so
let<00:03:10.630> me<00:03:10.690> run<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.989> mailbox<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.680> pick<00:03:12.250> them

let me run to the mailbox and pick them

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.390 
let me run to the mailbox and pick them
up<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.820> hopefully<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.130> snow

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
up and hopefully I can get this snow

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.370 
up and hopefully I can get this snow
blower<00:03:15.610> back<00:03:15.850> together

let's go ahead and break this thing open
and<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.810> they<00:03:40.020> got<00:03:40.260> me<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.770> part<00:03:41.130> I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
and see if they got me the right part I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.670 
and see if they got me the right part I
got<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.560> eBay<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.410> best

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
got this from eBay and it's not the best

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.070 
got this from eBay and it's not the best
packaging<00:03:47.550> I've<00:03:47.730> ever<00:03:47.940> seen<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.540> far<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.020> looks

good<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.150> can<00:03:54.270> see<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.950> look<00:03:56.130> like

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
good and you can see they look like

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.059 
good and you can see they look like
twins<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.760> me<00:03:57.140> both<00:03:58.140> legs<00:03:58.470> are<00:03:58.680> trying<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.010> be

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
twins to me both legs are trying to be

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.979 
twins to me both legs are trying to be
magnetized<00:03:59.730> at<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.120> point<00:04:00.390> towards<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
magnetized at this point towards that

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.440 
magnetized at this point towards that
magnet<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.620> now<00:04:02.489> I'll<00:04:02.610> place<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.819> card<00:04:03.239> in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
magnet so now I'll place that card in

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.420 
magnet so now I'll place that card in
there

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
there

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.250 
there
and<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:06.030> looks<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.300> it's<00:04:06.510> pretty<00:04:06.720> good<00:04:06.840> where

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
and it looks like it's pretty good where

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.309 
and it looks like it's pretty good where
it's<00:04:07.380> at<00:04:08.209> I'll<00:04:09.209> go<00:04:09.360> ahead<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.660> hit<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.080> real

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
it's at I'll go ahead and hit this real

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.460 
it's at I'll go ahead and hit this real
quick<00:04:10.590> with<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.830> impact<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.470> not

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
quick with the impact it's just the not

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.330 
quick with the impact it's just the not
real<00:04:13.680> tight<00:04:13.890> though

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
real tight though

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:24.080 
real tight though
I<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.790> bump<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.390> couple<00:04:15.600> times<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.760> a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
I just bump it a couple times and a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.780 
I just bump it a couple times and a
little<00:04:24.300> bit<00:04:24.389> more<00:04:24.660> here<00:04:25.340> now<00:04:26.340> let's<00:04:26.520> see<00:04:26.669> how

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
little bit more here now let's see how

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.969 
little bit more here now let's see how
this<00:04:26.970> works<00:04:27.320> that's<00:04:28.320> how<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.560> set<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.800> air

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
this works that's how you set the air

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.129 
this works that's how you set the air
gap<00:04:29.190> since<00:04:29.669> this<00:04:29.880> has<00:04:30.030> an<00:04:30.150> electric<00:04:30.570> start<00:04:30.900> I

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
gap since this has an electric start I

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.020 
gap since this has an electric start I
can<00:04:31.710> check<00:04:31.950> to<00:04:31.979> see<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.400> I'm<00:04:32.550> getting<00:04:32.790> good

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
can check to see if I'm getting good

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.250 
can check to see if I'm getting good
spark<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.040> can<00:04:35.130> see<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:36.260> spark

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
spark and then you can see the spark

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.440 
spark and then you can see the spark
tester<00:04:37.650> there<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.640> I'll<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:39.060> ahead<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.330> hit

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
tester there and I'll go ahead and hit

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.719 
tester there and I'll go ahead and hit
the<00:04:39.570> electric<00:04:39.750> starter<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.400> can<00:04:41.550> see

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
the electric starter and you can see

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.060 
the electric starter and you can see
it's<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> spark<00:04:42.539> that

get<00:04:45.520> up<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.880> around<00:04:46.420> okay<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> note<00:04:47.230> I'm

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
get up and around okay a note I'm

get up and around okay a note I'm
putting<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.980> blower<00:04:48.220> housing<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:50.050> have

putting in this blower housing you have

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.010 
putting in this blower housing you have
to<00:04:50.410> tilt<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.890> slightly<00:04:51.270> put<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.390> directly<00:04:52.510> in

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
to tilt it slightly put it directly in

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.950 
to tilt it slightly put it directly in
the<00:04:53.140> front<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.680> up<00:04:54.370> that's<00:04:55.360> because<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.840> this

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
the front and up that's because of this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.090 
the front and up that's because of this
tab<00:04:56.320> right<00:04:56.620> here<00:04:57.190> has<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.060> go<00:04:58.480> under<00:04:59.040> all<00:05:00.040> of

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.470 
tab right here has to go under all of
that<00:05:00.610> they're<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.330> couple<00:05:01.810> Springs<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.830> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
that they're a couple Springs and the

that they're a couple Springs and the
governor<00:05:04.480> arm<00:05:04.720> whenever<00:05:05.650> you're<00:05:05.800> putting<00:05:05.920> all

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
governor arm whenever you're putting all

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.650 
governor arm whenever you're putting all
this<00:05:06.280> back<00:05:06.460> together<00:05:06.610> be<00:05:06.940> real<00:05:07.120> careful<00:05:07.510> and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
this back together be real careful and

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.300 
this back together be real careful and
it's<00:05:08.200> always<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.470> good<00:05:08.560> idea<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.890> reach<00:05:09.100> in

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
it's always a good idea to reach in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.710 
it's always a good idea to reach in
there<00:05:09.460> then<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:09.940> check<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.360> make<00:05:10.540> sure

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
there then and the check to make sure

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.200 
there then and the check to make sure
that<00:05:10.960> your<00:05:11.370> carburetor<00:05:12.370> linkage<00:05:12.850> is<00:05:12.970> still

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that your carburetor linkage is still

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.300 
that your carburetor linkage is still
moving<00:05:13.360> freely<00:05:13.840> go<00:05:14.620> ahead<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:14.860> put<00:05:14.980> some<00:05:15.010> fuel

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
moving freely go ahead and put some fuel

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.970 
moving freely go ahead and put some fuel
in<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.640> so<00:05:15.990> let's<00:05:16.990> go<00:05:17.170> ahead<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.530> see<00:05:17.740> if<00:05:17.770> this

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
in it so let's go ahead and see if this

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.290 
in it so let's go ahead and see if this
thing<00:05:18.040> will<00:05:18.340> fire<00:05:18.550> up<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:18.880> then<00:05:18.970> I'll<00:05:19.090> check

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
thing will fire up and then I'll check

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.730 
thing will fire up and then I'll check
the<00:05:19.510> safety<00:05:19.840> switches<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.290> make<00:05:20.440> sure<00:05:20.560> they're

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
the safety switches to make sure they're

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.400 
the safety switches to make sure they're
working<00:05:21.390> okay<00:05:22.390> it's<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.750> little<00:05:22.840> bit<00:05:23.020> darker

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
working okay it's a little bit darker

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.080 
working okay it's a little bit darker
out<00:05:23.560> I<00:05:23.800> had<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.130> stop<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.460> get<00:05:24.580> something<00:05:24.820> neat

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
out I had to stop and get something neat

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.160 
out I had to stop and get something neat
I<00:05:25.270> hadn't<00:05:25.540> eaten<00:05:25.690> all<00:05:25.870> day

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
I hadn't eaten all day

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:39.710 
I hadn't eaten all day
fire<00:05:26.980> it<00:05:27.070> up

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.060 

let's<00:05:40.720> go<00:05:40.870> ahead<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.080> put<00:05:41.199> this<00:05:41.320> table<00:05:41.560> down<00:05:41.860> I

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
let's go ahead and put this table down I

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.100 
let's go ahead and put this table down I
can't<00:05:42.610> unfortunately<00:05:43.240> show<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.630> plowing<00:05:44.020> snow

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
can't unfortunately show it plowing snow

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.600 
can't unfortunately show it plowing snow
because<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.419> see<00:05:46.660> in<00:05:47.470> typical<00:05:48.070> Ohio

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
because you can see in typical Ohio

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.960 
because you can see in typical Ohio
fashion<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.900> now<00:05:50.199> rainy<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:51.010> 50<00:05:51.820> degrees

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970

today<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.720> had<00:05:53.199> some<00:05:53.380> people<00:05:53.530> want<00:05:54.430> to<00:05:54.520> know<00:05:54.550> how

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
today I had some people want to know how

today I had some people want to know how
this<00:05:55.000> table<00:05:55.300> went<00:05:55.449> down<00:05:55.600> so<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.680> show<00:05:56.979> that<00:05:57.250> I

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
this table went down so and show that I

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.010 
this table went down so and show that I
guess<00:05:57.580> I've<00:05:58.150> got<00:05:58.360> it<00:05:58.449> locked<00:05:58.570> in<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.930> up

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
guess I've got it locked in the up

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.800 
guess I've got it locked in the up
position<00:05:59.050> right<00:05:59.650> now<00:05:59.880> see<00:06:00.880> here<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.449> don't<00:06:01.600> know

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
position right now see here I don't know

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.430 
position right now see here I don't know
the<00:06:01.990> Lighting's<00:06:02.350> pretty<00:06:02.620> bad

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
the Lighting's pretty bad

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.969 
the Lighting's pretty bad
put<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.620> up<00:06:06.720> then<00:06:07.720> drop<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.080> down<00:06:08.790> and<00:06:10.979> table

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
put that up then drop it down and table

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.010 
put that up then drop it down and table
goes<00:06:12.100> down<00:06:12.340> to<00:06:12.910> figure<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.330> out<00:06:15.900> makes<00:06:16.900> it

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
goes down to figure that out makes it

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.090 
goes down to figure that out makes it
convenient<00:06:17.320> because<00:06:17.620> I'm<00:06:17.740> getting<00:06:17.860> too<00:06:18.070> old

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
convenient because I'm getting too old

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.490 
convenient because I'm getting too old
to<00:06:18.460> be<00:06:18.550> doing<00:06:18.729> it<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.330> other<00:06:19.449> way<00:06:19.660> here's<00:06:20.260> one

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
to be doing it the other way here's one

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.469 
to be doing it the other way here's one
of<00:06:20.620> the<00:06:20.770> benefits<00:06:21.310> of<00:06:21.460> having<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.820> lift<00:06:22.090> table

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
of the benefits of having a lift table

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.029 
of the benefits of having a lift table
at<00:06:22.600> your<00:06:22.630> house<00:06:22.990> if<00:06:23.289> you<00:06:23.410> do<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.530> lot<00:06:23.710> of<00:06:23.740> small

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
at your house if you do a lot of small

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.890 
at your house if you do a lot of small
engine<00:06:24.400> stuff<00:06:24.669> it<00:06:24.850> really<00:06:25.180> pays<00:06:25.449> off<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.720> have

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
engine stuff it really pays off to have

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:41.580 
engine stuff it really pays off to have
it

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.339 

just<00:06:42.590> easy<00:06:42.830> is<00:06:43.070> there

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
just easy is there

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.029 
just easy is there
something<00:06:45.159> else<00:06:45.339> that<00:06:45.460> I'm<00:06:45.669> real<00:06:45.849> big<00:06:46.029> on<00:06:46.270> is

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
something else that I'm real big on is

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.980 
something else that I'm real big on is
having<00:06:48.039> an<00:06:48.249> 8<00:06:48.369> foot<00:06:48.580> bed<00:06:48.819> it<00:06:49.389> sure<00:06:49.599> does<00:06:49.749> make<00:06:49.779> a

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
having an 8 foot bed it sure does make a

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.450 
having an 8 foot bed it sure does make a
difference<00:06:50.110> whenever<00:06:50.740> you're<00:06:50.919> getting<00:06:51.159> a<00:06:51.249> lot

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
difference whenever you're getting a lot

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.499 
difference whenever you're getting a lot
of<00:06:51.490> equipment<00:06:51.819> in<00:06:52.089> here

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
of equipment in here

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.179 
of equipment in here
the<00:06:52.749> one<00:06:52.899> thing<00:06:53.080> that<00:06:53.199> I<00:06:53.259> notice<00:06:53.559> on<00:06:53.770> this<00:06:53.949> like

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
the one thing that I notice on this like

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:56.089 
the one thing that I notice on this like
I've<00:06:54.369> noticed<00:06:54.729> a<00:06:54.879> lot<00:06:54.909> of<00:06:55.180> Chinese<00:06:55.659> engines

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
I've noticed a lot of Chinese engines

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:01.320 
I've noticed a lot of Chinese engines
they<00:06:57.099> do<00:06:57.159> lack<00:06:58.059> in<00:06:58.479> some<00:06:59.409> of<00:06:59.589> the<00:07:00.330> engineering

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
they do lack in some of the engineering

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.889 
they do lack in some of the engineering
aspects<00:07:02.139> the<00:07:02.319> small<00:07:02.619> details<00:07:03.189> so<00:07:03.789> like<00:07:04.719> in

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:04.899 
aspects the small details so like in

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.889 
aspects the small details so like in
this<00:07:05.050> case<00:07:05.319> the<00:07:05.740> governor<00:07:06.490> rod<00:07:07.210> can<00:07:07.689> be

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899 
this case the governor rod can be

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.019 
this case the governor rod can be
affected<00:07:08.589> by<00:07:08.740> so<00:07:09.189> many<00:07:09.369> different<00:07:09.520> things

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:10.029 
affected by so many different things

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.109 
affected by so many different things
that<00:07:10.270> are<00:07:10.389> passing<00:07:10.599> by<00:07:10.839> it<00:07:11.610> that's<00:07:12.610> just<00:07:12.789> an

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:13.119 
that are passing by it that's just an

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.149 
that are passing by it that's just an
engineering<00:07:13.599> design<00:07:14.050> that<00:07:14.349> they<00:07:14.529> probably

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
engineering design that they probably

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:16.850 
engineering design that they probably
didn't<00:07:15.610> think<00:07:15.819> out<00:07:16.029> whenever<00:07:16.389> they<00:07:16.599> were

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
didn't think out whenever they were

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.589 
didn't think out whenever they were
copying<00:07:17.860> it<00:07:18.069> off<00:07:18.189> of<00:07:18.430> Honda<00:07:18.969> or<00:07:19.089> whoever<00:07:19.389> they

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 
copying it off of Honda or whoever they

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.899 
copying it off of Honda or whoever they
may<00:07:19.749> have<00:07:19.869> copied<00:07:20.080> off<00:07:20.439> of<00:07:20.649> and<00:07:21.459> as<00:07:21.699> always

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:21.909 
may have copied off of and as always
