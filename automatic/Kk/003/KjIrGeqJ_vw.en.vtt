00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.830
 who does not know pikachu pikachu the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.690
 electric mouse of the first 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.000
 generation is the pokemon mascot 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 eternal companion of his ketchen cats 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 these all into the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 last poker is one of the pokemon 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.490
 more popular yet what is it worth 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.660
 really what is certain is that we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.970
 gave it importance 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 the diffusion of the posterior cartoon 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 at the exit of pokémon red and blue 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 in these games the possible starters 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.230
 are bulbizarre salameche and carapuce 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.330
 but not from four paths 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.399
 then comes the cartoon you have to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.649
 find a sascha companion of will be 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.480
 pikachu a weird pikachu that has 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.969
 the ability to put ko scum 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 or yet the type close soil with its 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.860
 electric attacks in the cartoon 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.059
 it's a pokemon over use ie 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 that it belongs to thirds of the points 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.930
 kemal the most powerful capable even 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.940
 to be played mixed ie with 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 physical attacks and special and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 who will defeat many opponents 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.520
 normally more powerful than him in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.590
 the reality is a pokémon les verts 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 used one of the least played pokémon 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 when handicapped by statistics of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.549
 low almost similar to anchovies 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.619
 its speed is drinkable but the rest 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.060
 close the daisies his attack and his 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.950
 special attack can however be 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 doubled thanks to a beautiful object 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.689
 light whose origin is doubtful 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.159
 we will come back we will say that if 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.659
 pikachu was chosen to be the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.009
 mascot of pokemon is that he has the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.030
 potential to exceed all 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.590
 opponents 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.700
 that's not quite true what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.650
 many do not know is that normally 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 the starter of his cats should have been 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 Fired we can guess the good 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650
 problem but the fact often cataloged 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.540
 like a female pokemon designed for 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.729
 please girls to hit 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 everyone preferred pikachu them 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.530
 reasons for choosing this pokemon are at 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.659
 many of the reasons for pure marketing 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.430
 pikachu will be played on simulators in 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.500
 ever united the reason for it's that it 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.240
 enjoys an object the light ball 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 that he's the only one who can hold and who 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.170
 allows him to double his stats 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.880
 date to his attack goes to 110 are the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.680
 special tax at 100 this is in the end 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 not bad even if it's still a pokemon 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.380
 fragile handicapped by his statistics 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240
 defensive 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.909
 a question arises what exactly is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.070
 that the ball light the good light 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.380
 does not exist in reality it's a 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 invention we enter pikachu playable she 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 appeared in the second generation 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.550
 they could be obtained in 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.350
 transferring the horse picket from 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.570
 yellow pokemon in pokemon gold and silver 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.130
 and crystal later we could 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.080
 find held by some pikachu 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.400
 wild his intention was so 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.410
 facilitated as if the developers 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.930
 wanted to avoid frustrating the fans of the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.970
 pokemon with the sixth generation in gold 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.080
 if dome is a reality we have increased 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.390
 four points the statistics 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.489
 defensive of our electric mouse 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.470
 the goal allow any player 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.380
 to slip into the skin of sacha and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.730
 to play with his favorite pokemon after 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.470
 the broadcast of the cartoon 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.970
 the public's lure for pikachu was 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.739
 such as it took a game out in 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.329
 the starter frame will be on pokemon 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.010
 but soon we realized 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.230
 of a thing with statistics 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.540
 close to those of rat tata and katchoo 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.489
 simply unplayable while evolving 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.650
 rightshore your pokemon gets from 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.570
 correct statistics and in pokemon 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.489
 yellow and katchoo could not evolved 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.120
 and many did not care about the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.370
 evolve 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.100
 so we had to find something 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.020
 was the ball the humor 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790
 the choice of pikachu as mascot of 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.170
 pokemon to something logical that's 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.050
 one of the pokémon who embodies the best 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.400
 the idea of ​​friendship and solidarity 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.510
 the pikachu are organized around 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.250
 common goals 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.960
 the pokedex does not describe them as 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.790
 pokemon who often act en route 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 when many of these pokémon 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.970
 bring together they cause 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.010
 gigantic courage he lives in the forest 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.810
 with his peers he comes to hand 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.130
 to plumb a pikachu allies in him 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.110
 sending an electric shock 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.390
 this ability to be charged by 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.400
 the electricity of an ally is possible 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.440
 thanks to lightning rod that it immunizes to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.300
 electric type attacks and increases 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.280
 his offensive abilities if he receives a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.170
 of these attacks 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.370
 each pikachu will have a different task 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.050
 there are those who will monitor the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.550
 around those who will inspect them and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.200
 send an electric shock 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.970
 if he discovers something better 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.950
 probably to attract others 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.210
 pikachu those who will take charge of the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.190
 picking berries etc 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.620
 so it's incredibly pokemon 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.360
 anxious for the good of his peers alone he 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.990
 is rather weak but still says 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 redoubtable 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.320
 however, if he embodies the notion 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.300
 of friendship it is only towards the others 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.790
 pikachu because towards humans he 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.590
 is suspicious he lives in the forest far from 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.420
 men the idea of ​​threats is constantly 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.290
 present at home explains that it is 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.210
 always on the lookout 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.110
 so he catch but sacha can 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.970
 hardly be friends 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.440
 the pokemon who can sympathize with 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.299
 the men that exists 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.160
 pikachu is not part of it pikachu 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.900
 being one suspicious the natural 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.380
 intensive training will allow the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.090
 control 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.560
 we were made to believe that sacha and 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.920
 pikachu were the best friends of the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.690
 world 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.790
 without it pikachu could not have been 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.320
 of a pokemon mascot remember 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.240
 in the first episode of the series 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.220
 since has always refused to obey his 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.720
 chance after being attacked by 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.280
 looters fabec then by the team roccat 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.650
 he desires to seize it for a reason 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.610
 unknown because I did not find it 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.310
 agrees to obey him 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.810
 a little easy there something in a 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.330
 pokéball is not a companion of 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.710
 travel a pet primo this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.260
 pokemon does not have good statistics 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.160
 to be used in combat unless it 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.050
 holds a beautiful light 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.750
 but as we have seen above the 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.400
 light ball is a chimera 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.350
 twoio if we are going to have one for fun 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.150
 it is necessary to degrease intensively in 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.160
 pokemon in a pokéball is the beginning 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.840
 of consciousness greece the beginning of 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.410
 conference mistrust is still there 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.820
 Intensive Training Utility 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.350
 pokemon ruby ​​omega sakhir alpha have 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.570
 allowed the appearance of small cosplay 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.190
 cosplay of Pikachu and of course it is 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.820
 very cute I have nothing against it but 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.160
 recalls another 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.930
 pokemon wa farrell the poodle pokemon 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.460

 company and the first pokemon to 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.000
 can be groomed by becoming the

 second pot quément you the tables and 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.050
 customizable after which farrell

 pikachu confirms his pokemon status 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.200
 the country 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.820
 in the next episode it will be 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.540
 matter of two big shores the pokemon 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.540
