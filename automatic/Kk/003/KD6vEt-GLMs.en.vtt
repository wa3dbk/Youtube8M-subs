00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.490
 attention now begins the high school biology material you go 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.240
 watch 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.240
 the screen is the target of 37 good studies 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 or anything 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.659
 there are no numbers 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.659
 the snack 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.689
 There were people who gave 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.079
 christian horner 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.920
 pulls life like loss of vision in the eye into the area 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.980
 did well in school but I had never seen or not since it is and nadia campisi e 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.380
 said indignantly he ends up with the plantation 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.820
 I have work here on the site however that the fulfillment of these ways 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.180
 close 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 goalkeeper 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 It's hard to win these Brazilians. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.370
 is one of the biggest challenges for farmers to control pests in 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.590
 plantations so that the food arrives with good quality in the table of the 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.440
 people 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
 but how do farmers do to fight these pests? 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.790
 on the screen today you will see how the pests that attack the plantations will 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.040
 see how the action of insecticides is and what are the main problems caused 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 for them 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 and will also know the biological control and integrated management 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.620
 andrÃ© lima 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.000
 it's not just the people who ate beans and rice 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.230
 the fruits 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.020
 the plagues also 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.040
 in a short time this little thing this little thing can not end this 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.060
 plantation 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.630
 but I guess it does not do anything to stop these words of course I do 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030
 because it's not easy 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 There's a lot for us to decide. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.650
 in this respect accommodate us 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.220
 go to the beach 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.160
 It's not easy to end this newspaper. 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.530
 to end the game 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.880
 the bicheiro who prefer coffee and now what sadness never has a break 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.270
 these animals are called herbivorous animals 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 since the basic animal feed 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.820
 is the main 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.139
 it's like one of your punches 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
 are able to do away with a plant in no time 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.449
 it is always struggling against these practices but it is not only 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.290
 against the insects you saw mpf already mine 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.319
 the weeds and the bottoms 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.239
 also can or what if any farmer was putting a thing of each 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.959
 turn 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.019
 weeds will see 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.789
 look that 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:40.129
 if you do not take care they will end up with all the minerals in the soil 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.360
 who pays close attention to prevent them from growing 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.790
 percent of plantations 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.820
 if you do not know that expression that people struggle, it means that something 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.859
 it is a disgrace to prepare 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.389
 I already know my mother thinks a lot of expression she says the traffic already 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.579
 it was a plague 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.019
 now the backgrounds is easy to imagine 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 they cause plant diseases right that's right 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.969
 at night said gou competition very difficult 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.689
 We have to defeat many enemies. 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.459
 the presentation grows strong without realizing if the disease 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.669
 it is true 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.659
 are many enemies even 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.030
 first herbivorous animals after the weeds and the bottoms 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.919
 to combat so many enemies that farmers rely on the help of 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.540
 various weapons we will now know some of them 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.199
 nation looked here 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.259
 here we have about fifteen woven that attack the uncertainties here the fungicides 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:44.949
 who act in the battle of the funds and here the siders requests that act in control of the 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.809
 weed 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.889
 but the cast is only to use but the problem has not been solved 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.349
 after all, it's just putting people on the plantation. 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.659
 well, do not 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.659
 insecticides actually a double-edged sword 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.619
 the attacks and that they are about a similar problem 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.189
 if I put insecticide without taking care of that planting of 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.029
 bean 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.039
 I can end up with your income that's just down the road. 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.129
 recently 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.359
 Wait there, you're going to stay on the inside too. 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 calm 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.749
 I figured a bean plantation surrounded by character 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.270
 these trees are visited by ricky bees pollinate the forests 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:35.120
 orange trees 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.419
 now imagine that the beans have not attacked by a plaque 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.810
 forcing the farmer to fight the insecticide in the plantation 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.120
 Do you know what can happen? 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.310
 the insecticide can kill the bees although in turn I will not go 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.949
 to polemize azores 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.689
 and consequently loss will not be born more fruits in the orange trees 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.460
 other problem caused 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.639
 peluso said woven to the elimination of the natural enemies of the plagues 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.499
 this is even the insecticides can end up with the employer and as you have seen in 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:08.840
 another screen 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.120
 the end of a predator 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.319
 the former MP 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.279
 population is the same that happens in the crop 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.490
 I explain better team 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 is that if the game was gone to the goat 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.830
 with these animals that treats my plantation 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.789
 I can end up also killing another animal that feeds on a plague 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.779
 I did not understand you could end up killing such a natural enemy. 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.600
 and over there with the predators 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.780
 proceeding further increases the number of plagues three males 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.110
 and this can not end up also because the farmer uses products 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.639
 growing stronger and stronger in our internal problems. 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.869
 poses the problem of birds the resistance of pests to insecticides 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.189
 as an antibiotic 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.659
 if we take a lot of time taking them stronger and stronger to face the 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.659
 crisis
