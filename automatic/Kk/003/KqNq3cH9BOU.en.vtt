00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 this topic is interesting so for the test I will 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.220
 use ready-made flour mixture too 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.510
 here compound marry necessary and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 flour and sugar need only add 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.120
 about 50 grams of butter and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.690
 softened and 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.789
 milliliters 100 to 100 milliliters either 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.420
 water or little to the bottom of course better 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.530
 add 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.420
 milk will be so much tastier also 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 then here together you here with me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.739
 mix and with the mix here me in the box 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.589
 You walked such here paper molds 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.629
 just for the test I will need this 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.139
 I already said butter and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.920
 Milk 150 milliliters but if you want 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:05.100
 you can add more vanilla sugar 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 further for the cream I need cottage cheese 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 curd can use any of this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 maybe here I have perhaps you can 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.899
 use any vanilla no 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 love also for cream me more 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.189
 need chocolate chocolate can 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.890
 use any it can be or 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.340
 milky or slides of my bitter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 Babayevsky chocolate and also on top of me 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.520
 for sprinkling, I will use 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 coconut shavings 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.909
 Here and for the cream, I will need here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 such a syringe pastry he here 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.420
 me here are a few nozzles 8 pieces here 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.549
 and he is actually very comfortable 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.130
 to use so first you need to 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.759
 knead so I prepared a bowl for 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 dough now here means falling asleep mixture 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.000
 from flour 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.630
 then add here about 50 grams 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:12.629
 butter 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:15.150
 necessarily softened and needed 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.489
 neatly it will hurt so now 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.450
 add to this mixture Malaga Malaga 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:26.849
 you need about 250 grams or 100 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.629
 milliliters and gently knead the dough 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.720
 and so on the finished dough now 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.299
 time to spill silicone 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.290
 molds and did not smear anything I just 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:43.250
 I will vomit metal dough 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.230
 I greased with butter and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:54.410
 so here put paper molds 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 and gently pour the dough need dough 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.230
 It means about two thirds 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.410
 That's about as it will be enough as 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.890
 how the muffins then rise and will 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 highly 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.530
 so I poured the dough in my cups 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.620
 It turns out 10 muffins and now you can 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.140
 send them oven at temperature 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.600
 180 degrees about minutes at for 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.800
 my fixes have already started to rise 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.910
 here you probably already see while I would 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.610
 such a cupcake compartment 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.760
 Now you can do cream creed 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.680
 I need cottage cheese about 150 grams to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.060
 200 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.020
 then you need to add to taste 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.080
 sugar or vanilla his usual sweat 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.520
 about 50 grams of butter and crushed 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.850
 and also here for me i will have cream 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.430
 one dark and another light white cream 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.890
 for dark cream I need this one 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.340
 I have about 4 5 chocolate here 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.870
 pieces and we need them to melt on 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.850
 water bath or you can in 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.270
 microwave if you don't have time for 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.430
 30-40 seconds to put and chocolate 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.400
 melt and so I added to the curd 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.669
 butter and sugar now need it 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.330
 beat with a blender and cream was ready and 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.550
 and here I melted the chocolate and so here 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.510
 so I got the cream now it 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.760
 need to be divided into 2 parts and one 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.650
 add chocolate that is, I will succeed 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.870
 I have one dark and no color 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.050
 baked and cupcakes and now they can 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.870
 gently pull out the molds and we will 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.330
 grease them with cream that's dark and light 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.620
 cream and so here is what I have 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.260
