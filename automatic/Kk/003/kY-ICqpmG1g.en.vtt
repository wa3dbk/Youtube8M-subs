definitely<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.600> your<00:05:12.780> PC<00:05:13.200> can<00:05:13.410> run<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.800> get<00:05:13.919> it

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
definitely if your PC can run and get it

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.130 
definitely if your PC can run and get it

running around you know just entering a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.310 
running around you know just entering a
house<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.419> then<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.630> know<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:27.750> start<00:05:27.990> skipping

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.140 
house and then you know I start skipping
around<00:05:28.410> for<00:05:28.680> another<00:05:28.770> few<00:05:29.130> seconds<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.760> I

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
around for another few seconds and I

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.640 
around for another few seconds and I
didn't<00:05:30.750> really<00:05:30.960> get<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.229> because<00:05:31.350> in<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
didn't really get it because in the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.260 
didn't really get it because in the
comment<00:05:32.070> there<00:05:32.190> wasn't<00:05:32.520> any<00:05:32.669> slowdowns<00:05:33.120> at

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270

all didn't really make sense to me but

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.090 
all didn't really make sense to me but
that<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.700> my<00:05:35.820> list<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.300> cons<00:05:36.710> overall<00:05:37.710> at<00:05:37.890> the
