00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 with rowing more is a lot 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 better so we'll see here anyway 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.070
 we have big enough speakers 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.200
 which will challenge if the sound and alain 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.880
 height of the height of its high 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.929
 speakers 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.630
 so as I said here we see a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.880
 little bit but now we have the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.710
 hatch which is we guess the memory that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.250
 below but as I said we'll see 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.660
 that in the disassembly at the end find again 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 the left side where we are 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.739
 so the grids for ventilation the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.760
 most electric socket 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:47.430
 we have on the side the antitheft 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:52.469
 here is the announced without these the lock but 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 that that we have we have the network the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.969
 hdmi and we still have two taken 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.050
 usb 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.899
 on this side and the headphone jack I see 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.479
 no distinctive sign to catch 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.479
 6 super speed at his ds are usb 3 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.930
 we also have usb 3 is this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 we can do it and that's not very 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.850
 so hard to know that I'm doing this 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.829
 video on a small local where 1900 full 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 so I'm not in what these regulars 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.640
 to the thing for my nexus is preparing 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 completely completely clean 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 so we can see that the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 aspire to the screen and the keyboard that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.790
 are protected by one again 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.320
 a small layer of protection 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 we can see very quickly that there was 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.200
 also three multimedia keys and we 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.329
 will see during tests 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.009
 what exactly does it mean here we 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.350
 note the recovery 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.060
 the little touch to turn it on I 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 do this heap 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.289
 we will see that it must start 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.289
 relatively quickly 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.430
 so here he started he is drunk 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.650
 modern windows 8 interface 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.000
 that's it with the touch screen then the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.200
 first impression that we have 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.030
 actually the machine starts very 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.190
 quick 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.160
 responsiveness is pretty good on on 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.319
 the screen but still it's not 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.140
 necessarily what is inevitably what 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.400
 that he misses more practice so that but 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.590
 contrary to what some may 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.890
 think do not you have to believe 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.500
 that it's not at all something 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.720
 usable in the long run but rather 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.720
 rather punctually more than other 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.480
 punctual way become paved alleys 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.150
 click and somewhere it will still be 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.160
 for example for to go to move 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.760
 in the windows or go get the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.130
 charming menu where options on the sides 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.620
 where was going to close an application etc 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.109
 it will be easier to make the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.510
 to do there by hand which with the mouse in 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.489
 anyway it will be more intuitive and that one 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.819
 will have the opportunity to see him again at 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.299
 tests so there obviously we can 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.390
 go click on the desk there one 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.739
 still understands that this is it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.100
 less convenient to fetch 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.299
 touch desk information 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.769
 only with the mouse 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.859
 that's certainly why microsoft 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.389
 by the way started windows on 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.920
 the modern interface rather than on 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.760
 touch interface and after going 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.500
 want to search 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.049
 the touch interface it would not have been 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.569
 sense so there on an environment of 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.410
 leaflets we'll see what I know 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.410
 still very practical
