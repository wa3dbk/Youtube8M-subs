00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.280
 this potter will come after t95 as you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.140
 you know 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.930
 the most slopochny tank in the game and 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.980
 she breaks through the 100 house because 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:33.950
 her body from all we know T110 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:39.490
 5 does not break through at all 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 beat and 280 because corps and china and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.479
 NLD VFD and all the projections of two hundred 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.900
 fifty four millimeters and a joint 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.110
 armor plate he punched a finger 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.110
 often not always much as you see 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.970
 record I drove into my side and from there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.790
 you can easily change the rules that we are there 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.350
 only six millimeters here's a machine gun 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.110
 By the way, too, not always 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.720
 breaks because there are 180 millimeters 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.790
 and how can you notice these 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.210
 shields so in general according to the modules that 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.460
 to tell 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.460
 tanks are behind in the last in the zone 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.280
 the last three rinks and all that 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.000
 shifts closer to the front there is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 ammunition this tank can also set fire to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 in the back here's how you see it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.180
 big box into it and if you shoot something 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.170
 Nothing is criticized and if you shoot a little 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.890
 lower then you can set it on fire so guys over 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 what are you doing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.170
 quiet quiet wait take no more 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.150
 we shoot like that 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.060

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:35.730
 right more right stop everything and now we will 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:41.799
 punch it with a gold shell and a brother and 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:46.569
 the suitcase flew mind this cafe madan not 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:51.209
 got was complete full among those 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.280
 viewers will prove it is possible 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.379
 already cities ok now we again 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.150
 Let's try to shoot e3 gold 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:06.579
 projectile right in the mask guns now 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:13.000
 I will try to interestingly break the sky and I 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:18.699
 flew it that's ok that's good 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.229
 so well 400 we took off and let's do it again 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.970
 try try bb shell only 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:29.590
 it will probably be rebound it will be possible 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.199
 non-penetration everything is possible and now I have 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.509
 there are still a few split seconds and me 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.449
 recharge and I bummed at this 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:46.360
 great tank 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:50.820
 once every two and a half 2 thread not. 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.820
 bursts and 3 flew and 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:00.130
 this is a bb shell that's cool so we 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.150
 drove up to this tank and now we look 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.150
 where did we get him 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.930
 and we attacked him over watering and hit me in 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.740
 top bronelist 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.590
 but given that the projectile flew from 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:25.949
 arts and from a considerable distance 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:29.639
 and flew girlfriends so they're booking 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.629
 254 she is planning 205 4 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:37.710
 because when you fly it is a corner 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:40.949
 it is lost and its shell simply does not notice 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.900
 so spam them 360 object 261 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:47.430
 pierce the upper armor sheet 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.879
 on art t110 3 it is possible and very good 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:06:00.449
 Now we will try to punch 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:06:05.580
 look masquerade I did not drop 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:09.800
 only some 305 high know and no penetration 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.800
 it's like from 14 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.999
 and now we will recharge again 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:23.449
 Let's try to shoot a gold shell 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:28.879
 masked guns t110 e3 and flew 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:32.909

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:36.479
