00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the original drawings as proposed by jlc

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.230 
the original drawings as proposed by jlc
engineers<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.380> bottom<00:01:37.710> line<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> was

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
engineers the bottom line is that it was

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
engineers the bottom line is that it was
a<00:01:39.270> tricked<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> square<00:01:40.350> watch

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
a tricked it was a square watch

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
a tricked it was a square watch
so<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> squadra<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.030> sort<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> getting<00:01:42.750> back

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so the squadra is sort of getting back

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
so the squadra is sort of getting back
to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> spirit<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> original<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.579> three
