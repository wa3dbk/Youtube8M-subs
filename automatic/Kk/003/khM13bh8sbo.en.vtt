00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.720
 channel I am jim and good here I bring you the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.320
 Expecting unboxing of the edition 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 collector of dark souls 2 we are going to 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.890
 open and let's see what it is that 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.400
 contains this saying of this so 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.660
 expected game at least on my part and 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.660
 great house good if care greet 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.010
 you need to say hello and I think that everything 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.430
 the world knows who records these boxing 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.470
 I think also that yes you know 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.600
 in fact if I have here the take no no 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.050
 enough the mobile suspended in the air is 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.229
 just a good one when I was commenting 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.200
 not in fact today I have uploaded the final 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 not the grand finale of giving the first show 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 part is already complete in the channel 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 a good series at play rather said 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.440
 as much game as I doing the series what 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.290
 I have really enjoyed it, it seems like a 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.590
 spectacular flight and me with that I like 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 this second part the same thing that has 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.390
 liked tarc souls 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.680
 I think they are already more than good 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.680
 invested the money in it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.380
 in theory it should be so good 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:00.210
 well here is there already glimpsed 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.980
 the big good box does not just look like 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.130
 where else for this 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.080
 and good here is the attention 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.770
 collector that was the reflection we're going to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.610
 try to put it there 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.610
 piece of figure that of warriors 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.670
 I come in plastic 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.370
 all that I'm going to know how to slide towards 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 up that has not caught us millions and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 portals 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 you have to cut 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.700
 however it will be pineapple down here 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.410

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.910
 We are made 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.590
 and expect to see more 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.980
 at least you reassure yourself that nobody has 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
 open 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.030

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.620
 OK 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.319
 Oh 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.150
 Well, this 18 letters in boxes 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.030
 metal yes indeed Stafford is here 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 metal for fire 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.350
 once there is no pressure before his and if 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.350
 we are going to open 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.760
 the box the side is a pass 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.560
 now here stress codes and things 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.560

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.650
 active of the fixed 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.200
 the game and the holiday is now valid and the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.780
 Instruction manual book that 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.480
 good the chubby in the role of Gordon 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.090
 for what they have us used to and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.710
 good here the selection of topics is worth and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.140
 here the game dark souls 2 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.670
 so we went up to the metal box 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.670
 love is the same 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.939
 a moderate stop 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.880
 this supposedly from the album a mini 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.880
 album that also brings 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.460
 see what happened 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.520
 well be like the tree that brought the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.220
 Limited elite of the first living souls 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.249
 sin let's take a look like that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.109
 Quick 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.299
 I do not want to support myself much in the 

00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:44.439
 enemies or anything this I'll see it with 

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.439
 tranquility of course 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.309
 now that he is very very cool 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.529
 and I do not want either that we 'll get 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:58.019
 many enemies neither weapons nor with 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.340
 surprises so for these dark album 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:05.180
 souls is very very well 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.690
 ok here we have the map a map of the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.710
 lands where the whole game happens 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.040
 the drop-down map I will open the map 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.040
 madryn china 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.930
 where does it come from? 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.389
 a fabric map is worth a fold-out text 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.389
 and now we go with the big thing 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:42.159
 when you are now looking and saying 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.189
 how much movement the pug is 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.090
 resting on your couch as always 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.789
 may sound in the figure of the warrior 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.030
 impressive figure indeed 30 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.169
 centimeters 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.169
 let's try to remove it 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.860
 it does not come with anything here data 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.860
 backwards 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.310
 notice that the truth is that this 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.700
 follow a figure that is worth it worth 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:20.980
 this is worth it 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.980
 very very cool is very cool 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.669
 and here, then 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.680
 his double swords two swords for 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.060
 power is thrown to place you so 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.370
 simply what interests me is that 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.629
 prefers the detail of the figures of 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:42.300
 Texas collector's edition of absolutes 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:46.889
 so good very happy the truth very 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.509
 happy especially because in the end the 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:54.330
 I could get it at a good price 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.039
 let's say a decent price not like the one in 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.529
 a store since all of which 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.039
 pretty well known that he spent seven 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:03.120
 villages 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:05.639
 with the price of this selection as well 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.499
 there are soles up to here the boxing of giving 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.589
 show 2 I'm running like I'm going to hit 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:12.419
 a vice after all the episodes 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:15.240
 that we have recorded of age to give are still 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:17.879
 I still want to die more times 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.439
 so I'm running, trying like this 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.699
 that said so many thanks for 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.749
 have seen it we see many in the 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.749
 next video a hug
