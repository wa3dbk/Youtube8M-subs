00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.590 
thing to note areas like this you could
be<00:03:07.660> filling<00:03:07.989> these<00:03:08.110> voids<00:03:08.440> all<00:03:08.769> day<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.180> I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
be filling these voids all day so I

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.380 
be filling these voids all day so I
don't<00:03:11.320> try<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.830> every<00:03:12.160> single<00:03:12.340> little<00:03:12.970> pit

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
don't try to get every single little pit

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.050 
don't try to get every single little pit
hole<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.320> reason<00:03:14.650> why<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:14.830> because

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
hole and the reason why is because

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.840 
hole and the reason why is because
you'll<00:03:16.060> feel<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.660> when<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> sand<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.470> down

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
you'll feel it and when you sand it down

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.790 
you'll feel it and when you sand it down
another<00:03:18.850> one<00:03:19.060> might<00:03:19.269> show<00:03:19.480> up<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.050> then<00:03:20.590> you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
another one might show up so then you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.380 
another one might show up so then you
feel<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.430> sand<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.820> down<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.000> another

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
feel that and sand it down and another

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.100 
feel that and sand it down and another
one<00:03:22.510> might<00:03:22.660> show<00:03:22.810> up

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
one might show up

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.229 
one might show up
so<00:03:23.860> basically<00:03:24.280> hit<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.640> with<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.760> primer

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
so basically hit it with your primer

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.650 
so basically hit it with your primer
it'll<00:03:26.140> fill<00:03:26.320> in<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.650> hole<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> little<00:03:27.130> bit

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
it'll fill in that hole a little bit

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.720 
it'll fill in that hole a little bit
then<00:03:28.660> go<00:03:28.780> back<00:03:28.989> use<00:03:29.350> your<00:03:29.380> your<00:03:29.830> putty<00:03:30.100> and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
then go back use your your putty and

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.090 
then go back use your your putty and
then<00:03:30.820> sand<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.300> if<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.290> start<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.769> black

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
then sand it if you start to see black

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
then sand it if you start to see black
after<00:03:33.760> you're<00:03:34.030> standing<00:03:34.360> your<00:03:34.540> your<00:03:34.840> primer

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
after you're standing your your primer

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.320 
after you're standing your your primer
then<00:03:36.040> you're<00:03:36.400> going<00:03:36.670> too<00:03:36.820> far<00:03:37.060> so

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
then you're going too far so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.030 
then you're going too far so
anyway<00:03:40.330> that's<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.660> good<00:03:40.780> way<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.930> level<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.920> is

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
anyway that's a good way to level it is

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.330 
anyway that's a good way to level it is
by<00:03:42.190> using<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.580> derp<00:03:42.730> tech<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.410> that's<00:03:45.250> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
by using that derp tech so that's the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.050 
by using that derp tech so that's the
point<00:03:45.430> I'm<00:03:45.580> at<00:03:45.670> now<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.340> will<00:03:48.550> fill<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.030> in

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
point I'm at now so I will fill you in

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.270 
point I'm at now so I will fill you in
once<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.810> get<00:03:49.930> rid<00:03:49.960> of<00:03:50.080> paint

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280
