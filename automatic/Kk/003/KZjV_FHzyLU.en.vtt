00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
hey guys Steven from the unlocker comm

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.089 
hey guys Steven from the unlocker comm
and<00:00:07.170> today<00:00:07.560> we're<00:00:07.710> gonna<00:00:07.799> do<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.950> quick

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and today we're gonna do a quick

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.160 
and today we're gonna do a quick
explanation<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.760> what<00:00:09.000> art<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.599> then<00:00:09.990> how

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
explanation of what art is and then how

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.570 
explanation of what art is and then how
to<00:00:10.200> enable<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.889> your<00:00:11.070> android<00:00:11.400> kitkat

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to enable it on your android kitkat

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.829 
to enable it on your android kitkat
device<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.780> basically<00:00:14.000> right<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.059> every<00:00:15.690> time

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
device so basically right now every time

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.150 
device so basically right now every time
you<00:00:15.990> run<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.260> android<00:00:16.560> app<00:00:16.680> every<00:00:16.890> time<00:00:17.039> you

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
you run an android app every time you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 
you run an android app every time you
open<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.789> has<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.119> compiled<00:00:18.600> which

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
open it it has to be compiled which

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.150 
open it it has to be compiled which
means<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.080> has<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.289> translated<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
means it has to be translated from the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
means it has to be translated from the
app<00:00:20.460> code<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> machine<00:00:21.960> code<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.470> run<00:00:22.650> on

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
app code to the machine code to run on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.759 
app code to the machine code to run on
your<00:00:22.890> device<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:24.570> causes<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> tiny<00:00:25.500> bit<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
your device this causes a tiny bit of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
your device this causes a tiny bit of
lag<00:00:26.010> every<00:00:26.430> time<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.789> open<00:00:26.820> an<00:00:27.359> app<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.689> your

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
lag every time you open an app on your

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
lag every time you open an app on your
phone<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.320> might<00:00:28.529> notice<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.279> benefit

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
phone which you might notice the benefit

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
phone which you might notice the benefit
to<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> though<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.390> takes<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> lot

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to this though is that it takes up a lot

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.939 
to this though is that it takes up a lot
less<00:00:30.929> storage<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.650> happens<00:00:31.859> as

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
less storage because what happens as

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.370 
less storage because what happens as
soon<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> open<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.730> app<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.480> compiles

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
soon as you open that app it compiles

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.780 
soon as you open that app it compiles
all<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> necessary<00:00:35.040> stuff<00:00:35.280> writes<00:00:35.610> out

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
all of the necessary stuff writes out

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.220 
all of the necessary stuff writes out
the<00:00:35.910> code<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.480> whenever<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.809> close<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the code and then whenever you close the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
the code and then whenever you close the
app<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> deletes<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> code<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> save

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
app it deletes all of that code and save

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.440 
app it deletes all of that code and save
space

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
space

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.500 
space
now<00:00:39.899> since<00:00:40.770> storage<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.730> become<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.149> less

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
now since storage has become a lot less

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.360 
now since storage has become a lot less
expensive<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.379> easier<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> put<00:00:44.129> into

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
expensive and a lot easier to put into

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.220 
expensive and a lot easier to put into
devices<00:00:44.670> google<00:00:45.420> has<00:00:45.510> been<00:00:45.539> working<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
devices google has been working for the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
devices google has been working for the
past<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.680> years<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.190> their<00:00:47.340> own<00:00:47.520> runtime<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.450> a

past two years on their own runtime on a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479 
past two years on their own runtime on a
new<00:00:48.719> version<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.950> does<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.370> it's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
new version what this does and it's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.479 
new version what this does and it's
called<00:00:50.730> art<00:00:50.969> will<00:00:51.960> allow<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> basically

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
called art will allow you to basically

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.100 
called art will allow you to basically
every<00:00:53.730> time<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.000> install<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> app<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
every time you install the app it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
every time you install the app it
compiles<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> necessary<00:00:56.100> code<00:00:56.670> right

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
compiles all of the necessary code right

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
compiles all of the necessary code right
there<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:58.140> makes<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> install

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there and then which makes the install

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
there and then which makes the install
time<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> tiny<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.399> longer<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.059> every<00:01:00.600> time

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
time a tiny bit longer but every time

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.060 
time a tiny bit longer but every time
you<00:01:00.870> open<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> app<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.920> more

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you open the app it's much more

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
you open the app it's much more
instantaneous<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.329> compile

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
instantaneous you don't have to compile

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.260 
instantaneous you don't have to compile
it<00:01:03.780> every<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.409> open<00:01:04.850> right<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:05.880> they've

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it every time you open right now they've

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.130 
it every time you open right now they've
launched<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:06.810> put<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> into

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
launched this and they put it into

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
launched this and they put it into
Android<00:01:07.470> 4.4<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> an

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
Android 4.4 but it's kind of an

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.429 
Android 4.4 but it's kind of an
experimental<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
experimental thing and it's in the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
experimental thing and it's in the
settings<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> turn<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
settings and you have to turn it on in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.170 
settings and you have to turn it on in
order<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> try<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.080> out<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.100> plan<00:01:14.400> probably<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
order to try it out the plan probably is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.920 
order to try it out the plan probably is
to<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.840> into<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.860> Android<00:01:17.100> 4.5<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
to put this into you know Android 4.5 or

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.300 
to put this into you know Android 4.5 or
5.0<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:18.990> whatever<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> new<00:01:19.530> version<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.130> be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
5.0 or whatever the new version will be

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
5.0 or whatever the new version will be
as<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> standard<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
as kind of a standard but in the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
as kind of a standard but in the
meantime<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.950> allow<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.520> enable<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
meantime they allow you to enable it so

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.370 
meantime they allow you to enable it so
you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> test<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you can test it out and see what you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.789 
you can test it out and see what you
think

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
think

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
think
I've<00:01:26.040> been<00:01:26.280> using<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I've been using it for a little bit and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
I've been using it for a little bit and
it<00:01:27.180> seems<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.479> most<00:01:27.780> apps<00:01:28.080> work<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.619> fine

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it seems that most apps work just fine
