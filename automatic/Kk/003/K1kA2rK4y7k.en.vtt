00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
didn't like how the edges looked because

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.200 
didn't like how the edges looked because
it<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:16.139> too<00:00:16.590> much<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> metal<00:00:17.609> showing<00:00:17.850> and

it had too much of the metal showing and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.750 
it had too much of the metal showing and
it<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.480> didn't<00:00:19.020> look<00:00:19.050> good<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.490> I'm

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it just didn't look good so I'm

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.740 
it just didn't look good so I'm
switching<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> clear<00:00:23.480> comes<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.630> the

spray bottle the packaging is a little
bit<00:00:26.430> different<00:00:26.760> compared<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> wood<00:00:30.090> skin

the back front screen protector I'm not
going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.149> using<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.020> am

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to be using this because I am

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.119 
going to be using this because I am
using<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.950> tempered<00:00:50.309> glass<00:00:50.430> screen<00:00:50.520> protector

using a tempered glass screen protector

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
using a tempered glass screen protector
the<00:00:54.110> four<00:00:55.110> dollar<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> bought<00:00:57.109> has<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the four dollar one that I bought has a

the four dollar one that I bought has a
slight<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> haloing<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> I've<00:01:01.050> bought<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
slight bit of haloing so I've bought a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.680 
slight bit of haloing so I've bought a
different<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.430> should<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.180> coming

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
different kind that should be coming

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.000 
different kind that should be coming
sometime<00:01:03.870> next<00:01:04.199> week<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.589> I'll<00:01:04.710> post<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
sometime next week so I'll post the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.000 
sometime next week so I'll post the
video<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:07.189> here<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:10.010> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
video up for that one and here are the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.289 
video up for that one and here are the
sides<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> again<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.860> issue<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.150> wood

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
sides so again same issue as the wood

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.070 
sides so again same issue as the wood
skin<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> bottom<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:17.420> I'm<00:01:18.420> not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
skin on the bottom right here I'm not

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
skin on the bottom right here I'm not
sure<00:01:19.350> why<00:01:19.530> they're<00:01:19.680> separating<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.640> because

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
sure why they're separating it because

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
sure why they're separating it because
I've<00:01:21.180> seen<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:22.290> I've<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.710> used<00:01:22.920> other

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I've seen or I've actually used other

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
I've seen or I've actually used other
skin<00:01:23.610> homies<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:23.939> other<00:01:24.060> phones<00:01:24.360> where<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
skin homies for other phones where for a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.539 
skin homies for other phones where for a
piece<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.280> they'll<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> thin

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
piece like this they'll have a thin

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.010 
piece like this they'll have a thin
thread<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.579> material<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> still<00:01:30.689> connects

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
thread of material that still connects

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
thread of material that still connects
it<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> separated<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it but because it's separated like this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
it but because it's separated like this
that's<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> wood<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.380> looked<00:01:34.590> bad

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that's why the wood one looked bad

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.920 
that's why the wood one looked bad
because<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.909> too<00:01:36.780> many

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
because it was just a too many

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
because it was just a too many
separations<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> material<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.150> I'm

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
separations of the material but I'm

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
separations of the material but I'm
thinking<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.350> clear<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> lot

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
thinking the clear will look a lot

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.569 
thinking the clear will look a lot
better<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> clear<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.070> let's

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
better just because it is clear so let's

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.859 
better just because it is clear so let's
go<00:01:44.700> ahead<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.000> install<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.750> what

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
go ahead and install this and see what

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
go ahead and install this and see what
the<00:01:45.990> phone<00:01:46.170> looks<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:49.310> your<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> edges

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the phone looks like your the edges

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:02.950 
the phone looks like your the edges
installed

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.900 

looks<00:02:03.500> really<00:02:03.710> good<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:06.770> can't<00:02:07.010> even<00:02:07.160> tell

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
looks really good you can't even tell

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.510 
looks really good you can't even tell
there's<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.710> clear<00:02:09.710> protector<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.369> there

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
there's a clear protector on there

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.180 
there's a clear protector on there
unless<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.940> look<00:02:11.150> really<00:02:11.840> carefully<00:02:12.140> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.970 

let's<00:02:16.190> go<00:02:16.370> ahead<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.470> install<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.770> back

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
let's go ahead and install the back

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040 
let's go ahead and install the back
which<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.580> hard<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.720> this

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
which will be the hard one because this

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.420 
which will be the hard one because this
is<00:02:21.110> glassy<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> want<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.890> make<00:02:22.010> sure<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.280> wipe

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
is glassy you want to make sure you wipe

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.100 
is glassy you want to make sure you wipe
it<00:02:22.580> down<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:23.030> clean<00:02:23.390> before<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.840> put<00:02:24.020> it

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
it down really clean before you put it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.450 
it down really clean before you put it
on<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.440> don't<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.710> any<00:02:24.860> smudge<00:02:25.160> marks

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
on so you don't have any smudge marks

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.360 
on so you don't have any smudge marks
and<00:02:25.700> again<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.810> secret<00:02:26.990> weapon<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.710> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and again the secret weapon is this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.250 
and again the secret weapon is this
canned<00:02:28.730> air<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.480> after<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.870> wipe<00:02:30.020> this

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
canned air because after you wipe this

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.450 
canned air because after you wipe this
clean<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.830> want<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.070> just<00:02:32.800> blow<00:02:33.800> away<00:02:33.950> all<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
clean you want to just blow away all the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.090 
clean you want to just blow away all the
best<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.420> then<00:02:35.600> put<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.900> clear<00:02:36.380> skin<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.800> so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
best and then put the clear skin on so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.810 
best and then put the clear skin on so
let's<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.400> ahead<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.670> do<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:39.520> here<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
let's go ahead and do that here is the

I<00:03:03.470> am<00:03:03.800> already<00:03:04.250> enjoying<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.800> hands<00:03:06.800> feel

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
I am already enjoying is the hands feel

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.860 
I am already enjoying is the hands feel
of<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:09.739> not<00:03:09.950> falling<00:03:10.250> off<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
of it in that it's not falling off the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.900 
of it in that it's not falling off the
glass<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.530> its<00:03:15.739> own<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.160> slippery<00:03:16.640> and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
glass on its own is really slippery and

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.590 
glass on its own is really slippery and
you<00:03:17.630> don't<00:03:17.750> want<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.050> fall<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:20.360> gives

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
you don't want it to fall but this gives

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.990 
you don't want it to fall but this gives
you<00:03:20.750> some<00:03:20.959> grip<00:03:21.260> right<00:03:21.500> here<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.040> that's<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
you some grip right here so that's a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.350 
you some grip right here so that's a
major<00:03:23.150> benefit<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.910> retains

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
major benefit and it's just it retains

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.190 
major benefit and it's just it retains
the<00:03:27.640> nice<00:03:28.640> visual<00:03:29.150> aesthetics<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.959> foam

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
the nice visual aesthetics of the foam

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.130 
the nice visual aesthetics of the foam
because<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.880> really<00:03:32.390> premium<00:03:32.660> device

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
because this is a really premium device

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.840 
because this is a really premium device
so<00:03:33.410> instead<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.860> sticking<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.400> case<00:03:34.640> I

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
so instead of sticking it in a case I

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.090 
so instead of sticking it in a case I
just<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.020> tend<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.800> out<00:03:36.890> like

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
just like to tend to have it out like

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.480 
just like to tend to have it out like
this<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:39.130> yeah<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.459> know<00:03:40.489> me<00:03:40.760> clear<00:03:41.239> skin
