out and now that have had some time to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
play with it I want to break down the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
play with it I want to break down the
major<00:00:27.420> differences<00:00:27.930> between<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
major differences between it and the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
major differences between it and the
first<00:00:29.460> generation<00:00:29.970> iPad<00:00:30.240> air<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> ultimately

first generation iPad air and ultimately

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
first generation iPad air and ultimately
help<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> decide<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.279> worth<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
help you decide if it's worth the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120 
help you decide if it's worth the
upgrade<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.079> it'll<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.380> easiest<00:00:34.800> just

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
upgrade so I think it'll be easiest just

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
upgrade so I think it'll be easiest just
to<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.579> down<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> list<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> everything<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to go down the list of everything that

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
to go down the list of everything that
is<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> iPad<00:00:37.980> air<00:00:38.129> 2<00:00:38.190> which

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
is different about the iPad air 2 which

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.910 
is different about the iPad air 2 which
like<00:00:39.030> most<00:00:39.300> Apple<00:00:39.750> products<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> thinner<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
like most Apple products is thinner and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.150 
like most Apple products is thinner and
lighter<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.940> iPad<00:00:42.180> air<00:00:42.210> 2<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:43.160> 6.1

reflective coating as far as what that
means<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> English<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> enhance

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510

your<00:01:09.720> viewing<00:01:09.990> experience<00:01:10.140> because

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
your viewing experience because

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.050 
your viewing experience because
obviously<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.490> less<00:01:11.700> glare

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
obviously there's gonna be less glare

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
obviously there's gonna be less glare
and<00:01:12.299> better<00:01:12.840> viewing<00:01:13.260> angles<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and better viewing angles and it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
and better viewing angles and it's
really<00:01:14.100> hard<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> portray<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
really hard to kind of portray that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
really hard to kind of portray that
through<00:01:15.720> video<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.530> sure<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> guys

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
through video I'm not sure if you guys

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.350 
through video I'm not sure if you guys
can<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> chance<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can see this but if you get a chance to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
can see this but if you get a chance to
compare<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.020> person<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> look

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
compare the two in person if you look

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
compare the two in person if you look
towards<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> corner<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.479> where

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
towards the corner you can see where

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
towards the corner you can see where
there's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> separation<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:23.100> didn't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there's a separation I really didn't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
there's a separation I really didn't
notice<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.549> before<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.450> once<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
notice that before but once you get a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
notice that before but once you get a
hold<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> new<00:01:25.680> iPad<00:01:26.009> air<00:01:26.070> 2<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.880> pretty

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
hold of the new iPad air 2 it's pretty

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.429 
hold of the new iPad air 2 it's pretty
obvious<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> pretty<00:01:28.229> substantial

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
obvious and it is a pretty substantial

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.260 
obvious and it is a pretty substantial
difference<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> doesn't<00:01:30.060> mean<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
difference now that doesn't mean that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
difference now that doesn't mean that
the<00:01:30.420> iPad<00:01:30.689> air<00:01:30.810> 2<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> 100%<00:01:31.950> glare

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the iPad air 2 is going to be 100% glare

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
the iPad air 2 is going to be 100% glare
free<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> pretty<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:34.200> job<00:01:34.380> at

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
free but it does do a pretty good job at

upgrade<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> I'd<00:01:40.860> say<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.280> necessarily<00:01:41.460> but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
upgrade and I'd say not necessarily but

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789

until<00:03:07.739> Apple<00:03:07.950> starts<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.489> implement<00:03:08.849> things

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
until Apple starts to implement things

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.759 
until Apple starts to implement things
like<00:03:09.180> separate<00:03:09.659> user<00:03:09.900> profiles<00:03:10.470> where<00:03:10.680> you

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
like separate user profiles where you

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.110 
like separate user profiles where you
can<00:03:10.890> then<00:03:11.040> login<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.670> your<00:03:11.760> thumbprint

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
can then login with your thumbprint

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.729 
can then login with your thumbprint
that's<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.930> where<00:03:13.109> it's<00:03:13.230> cool<00:03:13.500> but

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
that's going to be where it's cool but

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.440 
that's going to be where it's cool but
for<00:03:13.859> now<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.609> definitely<00:03:14.849> more<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.329> a

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
for now it's definitely more of a

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.750 
for now it's definitely more of a
convenience<00:03:16.109> as<00:03:16.290> opposed<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:16.980> necessity<00:03:17.340> if

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
convenience as opposed to a necessity if

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.390 
convenience as opposed to a necessity if
you<00:03:17.970> own<00:03:18.090> an<00:03:18.180> iPhone<00:03:18.269> 5s<00:03:18.690> 6<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.530> 6<00:03:19.859> plus<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.340> you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you own an iPhone 5s 6 or 6 plus and you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.339 
you own an iPhone 5s 6 or 6 plus and you
jump<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.790> an<00:03:20.910> iPad<00:03:21.180> without<00:03:21.450> touch<00:03:21.690> ID<00:03:21.870> then<00:03:22.230> it

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
jump to an iPad without touch ID then it

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.110 
jump to an iPad without touch ID then it
might<00:03:22.560> make<00:03:22.680> sense<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.790> again<00:03:23.970> it's

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
might make sense but really again it's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.520 
might make sense but really again it's
about<00:03:24.209> convenience<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.959> terms<00:03:25.139> of<00:03:25.319> just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
about convenience in terms of just

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.890 
about convenience in terms of just
unlocking<00:03:26.130> your<00:03:26.250> iPad<00:03:26.609> or<00:03:26.849> making<00:03:27.359> purchases

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
unlocking your iPad or making purchases

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.900 
unlocking your iPad or making purchases
by<00:03:28.079> unlocking<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:28.889> your<00:03:29.069> thumbprint<00:03:29.310> now

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
by unlocking it with your thumbprint now

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.369 
by unlocking it with your thumbprint now
it<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.299> secret<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.900> not<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.139> huge

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
it is not a secret that I'm not a huge

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.710 
it is not a secret that I'm not a huge
fan<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.680> taking<00:03:32.190> photos<00:03:32.609> on<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.849> tablet<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.389> just

fan of taking photos on a tablet it just

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.930 
fan of taking photos on a tablet it just
doesn't<00:03:34.169> look<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:34.859> Apple<00:03:35.220> has<00:03:35.459> updated

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
doesn't look right but Apple has updated

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.360 
doesn't look right but Apple has updated
the<00:03:36.120> camera<00:03:36.599> on<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.139> iPad<00:03:37.319> air<00:03:37.650> 2<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
front-facing camera is pretty much the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240 
front-facing camera is pretty much the
same<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:40.109> what<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.349> need<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.560> know<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:41.010> the

out there in public taking pictures with

out there in public taking pictures with
not<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.510> iPad<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.590> two<00:03:55.949> iPad<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.609> guys

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
not one iPad but two iPad so you guys

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.699 
not one iPad but two iPad so you guys
can<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.150> picture<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.750> visual<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.410> that

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
can just picture the visual on that

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.349 
can just picture the visual on that
video<00:03:59.280> quality<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.819> little<00:04:00.120> better<00:04:00.269> a

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
video quality is a little better a

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.509 
video quality is a little better a
little<00:04:00.510> less<00:04:00.840> noisy<00:04:01.379> on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> iPad<00:04:01.949> air<00:04:01.980> 2<00:04:02.129> as

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
little less noisy on the iPad air 2 as

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.610 
little less noisy on the iPad air 2 as
opposed<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.299> original<00:04:03.660> iPad<00:04:03.720> air<00:04:04.109> but

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
opposed to the original iPad air but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.900 
opposed to the original iPad air but
again<00:04:04.859> one<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.190> big<00:04:05.400> differences<00:04:05.849> between

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
again one of the big differences between

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.629 
again one of the big differences between
the<00:04:06.209> two<00:04:06.419> is<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.750> iPad<00:04:07.500> air<00:04:07.650> 2<00:04:07.680> offers<00:04:08.310> slow

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
the two is the iPad air 2 offers slow

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.759 
the two is the iPad air 2 offers slow
motion<00:04:09.000> video<00:04:09.359> where<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.959> cannot<00:04:10.199> get<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
motion video where you cannot get that

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.189 
motion video where you cannot get that
on<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.190> original<00:04:11.609> iPad<00:04:11.730> air<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.870> those<00:04:13.079> are

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
on the original iPad air so those are

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.509 
on the original iPad air so those are
pretty<00:04:13.290> much<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.530> main<00:04:13.949> differences<00:04:14.370> between

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
pretty much the main differences between

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.129 
pretty much the main differences between
-<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.299> ultimately<00:04:15.690> going<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.959> come

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
- I think it's ultimately going to come

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.819 
- I think it's ultimately going to come
down<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.739> whether<00:04:17.070> or<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.340> all<00:04:17.579> those

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
down to whether or not all those

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.229 
down to whether or not all those
things<00:04:17.979> add<00:04:18.189> up<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.489> are<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:18.819> worthy<00:04:19.120> upgrade

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
things add up and are a worthy upgrade

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.149 
things add up and are a worthy upgrade
for<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:20.289> most<00:04:20.470> people<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.859> think<00:04:20.919> you'll

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
for you for most people I think you'll

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.830 
for you for most people I think you'll
be<00:04:21.250> perfectly<00:04:21.699> content<00:04:21.939> with<00:04:22.240> your<00:04:22.509> current

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
be perfectly content with your current

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360 
be perfectly content with your current
iPad<00:04:23.229> air<00:04:23.409> but<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:23.770> you've<00:04:23.919> watched<00:04:24.159> this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
iPad air but if you've watched this

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.830 
iPad air but if you've watched this
video<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.970> there's<00:04:25.120> enough<00:04:25.330> compelling

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
video and there's enough compelling

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.360 
video and there's enough compelling
reasons<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.229> upgrade<00:04:26.319> I<00:04:26.740> think<00:04:27.129> you'll<00:04:27.250> be

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
reasons to upgrade I think you'll be

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.219 
reasons to upgrade I think you'll be
happy<00:04:27.729> as<00:04:27.849> well<00:04:28.090> obviously<00:04:28.360> if<00:04:28.930> you're<00:04:29.050> coming

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
happy as well obviously if you're coming

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.140 
happy as well obviously if you're coming
from<00:04:29.319> anything<00:04:29.620> prior<00:04:29.979> to<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.460> original<00:04:30.909> iPad

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
from anything prior to the original iPad

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.309 
from anything prior to the original iPad
