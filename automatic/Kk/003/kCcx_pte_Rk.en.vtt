00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on the needle that left-hand needle one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
on the needle that left-hand needle one
on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.640> hand<00:00:59.850> needle<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.660> stitch<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
on the right hand needle this stitch is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
on the right hand needle this stitch is
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.039> needle<00:01:02.600> there's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
going to go on to that needle there's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.969 
going to go on to that needle there's
two<00:01:03.899> different<00:01:04.110> ways<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.769> happen

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
two different ways that could happen

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.330 
two different ways that could happen
right<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.729> could<00:01:06.450> either<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.869> insert<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
right I could either just insert the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.510 
right I could either just insert the
left-hand<00:01:09.000> needle<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.570> loop<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.110> way

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
left-hand needle into that loop this way

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
left-hand needle into that loop this way
from<00:01:11.520> left<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> could<00:01:12.840> come

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
from left to right or I could come

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
from left to right or I could come
around<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.820> insert<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> needle<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
around and insert that needle into the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130 
around and insert that needle into the
loop<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.400> left<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:18.140> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
loop this way from right to left if you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
loop this way from right to left if you
do<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.400> called<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.909> untwisted

do it this way it's called an untwisted
knit<00:01:22.680> cast<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.450> usual<00:01:24.750> way

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
knit cast on and it's not the usual way

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:25.999 
knit cast on and it's not the usual way
to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to do it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
to do it
most<00:01:26.549> often<00:01:26.850> you're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.659> what's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
most often you're going to want what's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
most often you're going to want what's
called<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.320> twisted<00:01:28.829> knit<00:01:29.430> cast<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.970> most

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
called a twisted knit cast on most

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
called a twisted knit cast on most
people<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.170> call<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> straight-out<00:01:32.250> knit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
people just call it a straight-out knit

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
people just call it a straight-out knit
cast<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> insert

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
cast on and so you're going to insert

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.789 
cast on and so you're going to insert
your<00:01:35.159> left<00:01:35.970> hand<00:01:36.270> needle<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> loop<00:01:37.170> on

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
your left hand needle into the loop on

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.359 
your left hand needle into the loop on
the<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.100> needle<00:01:39.079> from<00:01:40.079> right<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.710> left

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the right needle from right to left

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
the right needle from right to left
basically<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.119> inserting<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
basically you're inserting it into that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
basically you're inserting it into that
loop<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> same<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.640> needle<00:01:44.939> that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
loop the same way that the needle that's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.760 
loop the same way that the needle that's
already<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.950> insert<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
already in it is insert it into it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.319 
already in it is insert it into it
tighten<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.520> you're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tighten that up and then you're going to

cast on stitches that we're casting on

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.070 
cast on stitches that we're casting on
by<00:02:22.170> knitting<00:02:22.440> them<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.450> actually<00:02:24.450> once

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
by knitting them on and actually once

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.710 
by knitting them on and actually once
you<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.790> don't<00:02:26.970> ever<00:02:27.239> really

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you get this going you don't ever really

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
you get this going you don't ever really
have<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.230> take<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.709> needles<00:02:29.129> out<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.819> loop

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
have to take the needles out of the loop

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.270 
have to take the needles out of the loop
of<00:02:30.180> yarn<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.980> goes

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
of yarn because of the way this goes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.330 
of yarn because of the way this goes
when<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.879> put<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.290> loop<00:02:34.290> onto<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.860> left-hand

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
when you put the loop onto the left-hand

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850 
when you put the loop onto the left-hand
needle<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:36.120> way<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.440> ever<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.799> to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
needle this way you don't ever have to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.470 
needle this way you don't ever have to
take<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.340> needles<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.090> put<00:02:39.330> your

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
take your needles out if you put your

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
take your needles out if you put your
loop<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.890> untwisted<00:02:41.489> way<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.700> would<00:02:41.940> have

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
loop on the untwisted way you would have

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.809 
loop on the untwisted way you would have
to<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.330> your<00:02:42.480> needles<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:42.870> each<00:02:43.590> time<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.549> if

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
to take your needles out each time so if

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.860 
to take your needles out each time so if
you<00:02:44.879> don't<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.269> take<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.480> needles<00:02:45.750> out

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you don't have to take your needles out

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.330 
you don't have to take your needles out
you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.410> you're<00:02:46.560> doing<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> right<00:02:47.130> way

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
you know you're doing it the right way

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.100 
you know you're doing it the right way
and<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.280> goes<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.870> makes

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
and that just goes like that this makes

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
and that just goes like that this makes
a<00:02:52.290> nice<00:02:52.500> stretchy<00:02:53.250> cast<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.989> drop

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
a nice stretchy cast on but if you drop

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.229 
a nice stretchy cast on but if you drop
a<00:02:55.260> stitch<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:55.890> you're<00:02:56.010> working<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.970> will

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
a stitch when you're working it it will

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.699 
a stitch when you're working it it will
just<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.599> lost<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:58.049> away<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.379> will<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.530> very

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
just get lost right away it will be very

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
just get lost right away it will be very
difficult<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.190> find<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.579> back<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:01.170> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
difficult to find it back but it's a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.569 
difficult to find it back but it's a
good<00:03:01.440> cast<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.400> nice<00:03:02.549> and

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
good cast on and it's nice and

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:11.650 
good cast on and it's nice and
straightforward

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.720
