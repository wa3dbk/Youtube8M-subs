00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.249
 the work as a threat 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.550

 Contest it is called 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.380

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.680
 So wait and see 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.900
 and 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.440
 i pay close attention to the little i know if now putting was six years 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 and just as on gossip and over us for a lot of them otherwise 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 Holocaust on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 I feel good 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.340
 So until 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 it is better if Philip Twele nerves chest can now so all the principles 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.460
 really brings a lot of points 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.200
 at de writes "I'm making the area colorful and then I'm off 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.230
 not so in the hair 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.930
 the showmaster come the march Dr 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.410
 why is he joining me so I'm making this possible 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.140
 if I do not mind I let it in even if I leave it 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.260
 will be charged 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.430
 and even if they make it clear now that there is no answer like that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.260
 So get out 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.430
 You also have to fight in the Bundesliga 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.860
 okay he 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 Of course there are also important prices at Mainburg 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.490
 "I and last time bad Sauveur recommendations, the whole crap 8 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.550
 and here 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.130
 Dr 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 the rescuers are in need of third place 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.479
 these si androids 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.879
 without doing 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 Nerlinger could 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.219
 the second place 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.879
 gets that act was more 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.159
 choose eight topics Artistry 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.010
 But you can also burned off well as Carlos once used to 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.729
 the first place will come 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.729
 this second episode 3 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.809
 Pilots clones 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.099
 exactly the 2 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.609
 absolutely not important 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.299
 from the good condition 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.430
 All right and there are also several dogs in my account 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 So that makes me happy to win good prizes 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.399
 the orders are often different 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.889
 and I wonder what you get out in the second round right now 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.449
 the preliminary round matches see everything 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.949
 just do not believe this praise 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.399
 then there is another round 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.159
 then there is the final round 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.559
 that leads after two rounds 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.049
 all right 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.920
 Darnell Simons or you will probably be later 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.269
 okay then still possible good records Marx a right for so 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.109
 make everybody do it too 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.899
 but win good prizes 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.389
 the wines the clones are really worth a lot 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.379
 whether elegant look
