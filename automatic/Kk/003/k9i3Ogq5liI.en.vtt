00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hey guys this is Admiral and this is a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.839 
hey guys this is Admiral and this is a
super<00:00:06.450> simple<00:00:06.810> tnt<00:00:07.410> cannon<00:00:07.440> made<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
super simple tnt cannon made out of the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.360 
super simple tnt cannon made out of the
new<00:00:09.000> slime<00:00:09.300> box<00:00:09.540> i<00:00:09.840> think<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.710> superior

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
new slime box i think this is superior

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.999 
new slime box i think this is superior
to<00:00:11.490> many<00:00:11.880> old<00:00:12.179> tnt<00:00:12.719> cannon<00:00:12.750> designs<00:00:13.410> because

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
to many old tnt cannon designs because

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.440 
to many old tnt cannon designs because
since<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.490> don't<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.240> other

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
since you don't have to have the other

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.410 
since you don't have to have the other
tnt<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> launch<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.529> single<00:00:16.920> piece<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> TT<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
tnt to launch the single piece of TT you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.700 
tnt to launch the single piece of TT you
get<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> launch<00:00:18.750> into<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.170> super<00:00:19.500> quickly

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
get a launch into you super quickly

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.900 
get a launch into you super quickly
because<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> wait<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
because you don't have to wait for the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.570 
because you don't have to wait for the
other<00:00:21.150> teensy<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> ignite<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:23.250> save<00:00:23.460> them

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
other teensy to ignite and you save them

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.890 
other teensy to ignite and you save them
resources<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> don't<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
resources because you don't have to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.189 
resources because you don't have to
waste<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.529> bunch<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> GE<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.580> launch<00:00:26.760> one

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
waste a bunch of GE just to launch one

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
waste a bunch of GE just to launch one
so<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> works<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:29.039> tnt<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.060> also<00:00:30.330> works<00:00:30.599> on

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
so this works on tnt it also works on

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.569 
so this works on tnt it also works on
tossed<00:00:31.500> items<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.210> toss<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.809> onto<00:00:34.230> there

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
tossed items if I toss this onto there

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.340 
tossed items if I toss this onto there
it'll<00:00:35.579> launch<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.780> kind<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> hard<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> see

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it'll launch it was kind of hard to see

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
it'll launch it was kind of hard to see
let<00:00:37.469> me<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.680> over<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.010> find<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.809> there

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
let me go over there and find it there

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
let me go over there and find it there
it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.020> yeah<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> items<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.950> about<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.430> far<00:00:41.579> as

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it is yeah the items go about as far as

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.810 
it is yeah the items go about as far as
the<00:00:41.820> TT<00:00:42.210> other<00:00:43.170> entities<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.219> boats<00:00:44.520> mine

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the TT other entities just boats mine

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.720 
the TT other entities just boats mine
carts<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.410> villagers<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.489> far

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
carts and villagers they don't go as far

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
carts and villagers they don't go as far
but<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.719> launch<00:00:49.079> yourself<00:00:49.230> if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
but you could also launch yourself if

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
but you could also launch yourself if
you<00:00:49.980> run<00:00:50.250> onto<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.840> pretty

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you run onto it like that that's pretty

another fairness or another non movable

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
another fairness or another non movable
block<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.920> say<00:01:46.950> non<00:01:47.280> moveable<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.880> mean

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
block and when I say non moveable I mean

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.580 
block and when I say non moveable I mean
a<00:01:48.090> block<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> can't<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> pushed<00:01:49.049> by<00:01:49.170> piston

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
a block that can't be pushed by piston

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
a block that can't be pushed by piston
so<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.130> furnace<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> Chapman<00:01:51.509> table
