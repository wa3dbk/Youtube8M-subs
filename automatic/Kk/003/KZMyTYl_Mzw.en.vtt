that<00:03:09.100> beast<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.940> sniper<00:03:10.330> rifle<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.990> saw<00:03:11.260> in

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that beast of a sniper rifle we saw in

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.040 
that beast of a sniper rifle we saw in
the<00:03:11.890> reveal<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.940> campaign<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.720> gun<00:03:14.020> is

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
the reveal of the campaign this gun is

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.380 
the reveal of the campaign this gun is
not<00:03:14.410> only<00:03:14.770> able<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.100> see<00:03:15.310> through<00:03:15.520> walls<00:03:15.790> but

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
not only able to see through walls but

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.850 
not only able to see through walls but
you<00:03:16.510> can<00:03:16.690> fire<00:03:16.959> through<00:03:17.290> almost<00:03:17.470> any

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
you can fire through almost any

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.250 
you can fire through almost any
substance<00:03:18.489> when<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.850> charge<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.360> up<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.930> gun

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
substance when you charge it up this gun

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.740 
substance when you charge it up this gun
is<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.890> beast<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.120> weapon<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.540> would<00:03:22.630> have

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
is a beast of a weapon it would have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.449 
is a beast of a weapon it would have
been<00:03:22.810> cool<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.200> see<00:03:23.350> included<00:03:23.800> in<00:03:23.890> zombies<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
been cool to see included in zombies I

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.380 
been cool to see included in zombies I
don't<00:03:24.580> think<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.150> had

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
don't think it would have really had

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.850 
don't think it would have really had
much<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.840> purpose<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.530> really<00:03:26.739> much

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
much of a purpose it's not really much

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.470 
much of a purpose it's not really much
of<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.040> need<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.340> shoot<00:03:27.520> your<00:03:27.700> things<00:03:27.940> or<00:03:28.239> see

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
of a need to shoot your things or see

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.240 
of a need to shoot your things or see
through<00:03:28.690> walls<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.530> maybe<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.860> could<00:03:29.950> fire

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
through walls but maybe you could fire

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.979 
through walls but maybe you could fire
it<00:03:30.280> an<00:03:30.610> entire<00:03:30.820> horde<00:03:31.420> when<00:03:31.630> it's<00:03:31.750> fully

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it an entire horde when it's fully

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.750 
it an entire horde when it's fully
charged<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.500> wiped<00:03:32.890> them<00:03:33.160> out<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.520> it'd

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
charged and wiped them out I think it'd

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.479 
charged and wiped them out I think it'd
be<00:03:33.790> pretty<00:03:33.970> sweet<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.510> see<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.810> zombies

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
be pretty sweet to see in zombies

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.740 
be pretty sweet to see in zombies
sliding<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.580> is<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> second<00:03:37.180> best<00:03:37.300> weapon<00:03:37.630> we

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
sliding in is the second best weapon we

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.449 
sliding in is the second best weapon we
should<00:03:37.900> have<00:03:38.020> seen<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.320> zombies<00:03:38.709> was<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> vector

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
should have seen in zombies was a vector

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.580 
should have seen in zombies was a vector
k10<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:40.420> was<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> little<00:03:40.930> bit<00:03:41.050> surprised<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> see

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
k10 I was a little bit surprised to see

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.770 
k10 I was a little bit surprised to see
the<00:03:41.860> vector<00:03:42.190> k10<00:03:42.430> personally<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.209> ranked<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the vector k10 personally I ranked the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.110 
the vector k10 personally I ranked the
vector<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.230> little<00:03:44.860> bit<00:03:45.040> lower<00:03:45.340> i<00:03:45.520> enjoy<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
vector a little bit lower i enjoy the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.570 
vector a little bit lower i enjoy the
back<00:03:46.270> journal<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:47.230> i<00:03:47.470> was<00:03:47.890> not<00:03:48.100> expecting<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
back journal but i was not expecting you

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.650 
back journal but i was not expecting you
to<00:03:48.670> come<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.000> at<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.120> number<00:03:49.360> two<00:03:49.510> spot

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to come in at the number two spot

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660 
to come in at the number two spot
although<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.560> your<00:03:50.890> list<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.520> you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
although this is your list and of you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.490 
although this is your list and of you
say<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.360> vector<00:03:52.570> was<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.020> second<00:03:53.380> best

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
say so the vector was the second best

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.080 
say so the vector was the second best
weapon<00:03:53.860> we<00:03:53.980> should<00:03:54.160> have<00:03:54.250> seen<00:03:54.489> in

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
weapon we should have seen in

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.570 
weapon we should have seen in
these<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.140> vector<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.709> probably<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.459> my

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
these the vector is probably one of my

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.699 
these the vector is probably one of my
favorite<00:03:57.970> smgs<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.019> game<00:03:59.260> well<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.620> of

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
favorite smgs in the game well one of

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.350 
favorite smgs in the game well one of
the<00:03:59.769> more<00:03:59.890> favorite<00:04:00.190> unconventional<00:04:00.910> SMG

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
the more favorite unconventional SMG

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.869 
the more favorite unconventional SMG
certainly<00:04:01.930> don't<00:04:02.140> see<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.560> much<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:03.730> a

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
certainly don't see it much and it is a

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.300 
certainly don't see it much and it is a
fun<00:04:04.209> weapon<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.780> use<00:04:04.810> I'm<00:04:05.319> all<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.680> favor<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:06.040> it

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
fun weapon to use I'm all in favor of it

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.400 
fun weapon to use I'm all in favor of it
I<00:04:06.430> think<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:07.180> was<00:04:07.330> probably<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.750> disservice<00:04:08.230> to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
I think it was probably a disservice to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.830 
I think it was probably a disservice to
the<00:04:08.650> SMGs<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.400> not<00:04:09.580> include<00:04:09.819> some<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.480> them<00:04:10.599> in

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
the SMGs to not include some of them in

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.089 
the SMGs to not include some of them in
zombies<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.560> if<00:04:11.620> we're<00:04:11.739> gonna<00:04:11.830> throw<00:04:12.040> a

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
zombies and if we're gonna throw a

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.780 
zombies and if we're gonna throw a
couple<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.150> vector<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.989> worthy<00:04:14.349> choice

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
couple in the vector is a worthy choice

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.699 
couple in the vector is a worthy choice
the<00:04:15.790> number<00:04:16.269> one<00:04:16.540> weapon<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:17.019> guys<00:04:17.199> wish<00:04:17.500> you

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the number one weapon you guys wish you

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.150 
the number one weapon you guys wish you
saw<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.280> zombies<00:04:18.820> was<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.750> peacekeeper<00:04:20.739> how

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
saw in zombies was the peacekeeper how

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.640 
saw in zombies was the peacekeeper how
could<00:04:21.459> i<00:04:21.699> forget<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.300> Peacekeeper<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.229> didn't

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
could i forget the Peacekeeper I didn't

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.200 
could i forget the Peacekeeper I didn't
include<00:04:23.949> it<00:04:24.070> in<00:04:24.280> my<00:04:24.310> list<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.880> know<00:04:24.970> what<00:04:25.180> I

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
include it in my list you know what I

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.030 
include it in my list you know what I
think<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.720> consider<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.440> zombies<00:04:26.770> weapon

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
think I consider it a zombies weapon

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.890 
think I consider it a zombies weapon
because<00:04:27.280> i<00:04:27.430> play<00:04:27.669> with<00:04:27.790> it<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.030> many<00:04:28.330> custom

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
because i play with it in many custom

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.810 
because i play with it in many custom
zombie<00:04:29.290> gaps<00:04:29.470> either<00:04:29.740> way<00:04:29.950> though<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.669> was<00:04:30.790> a

zombie gaps either way though it was a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.510 
zombie gaps either way though it was a
disservice<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.810> zombie<00:04:32.470> fans<00:04:32.740> all<00:04:32.950> over<00:04:33.010> the

disservice to zombie fans all over the

disservice to zombie fans all over the

Peacekeeper into zombies after we
purchased<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.600> as<00:04:38.100> DLC<00:04:39.100> this<00:04:39.340> gun<00:04:39.580> was<00:04:40.000> fun<00:04:40.300> to
