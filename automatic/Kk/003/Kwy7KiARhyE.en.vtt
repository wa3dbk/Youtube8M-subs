lots of different areas if we have a
look<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> car<00:00:17.070> obviously<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.580> again

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
look at the car obviously there again

teams this year and the SAP have done a
very<00:00:23.340> neat<00:00:23.640> job<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.029> keeping<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> very

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
very neat job of keeping that very

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
very neat job of keeping that very
streamlined<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.609> then<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.820> sort<00:00:27.029> of

streamlined and then have this sort of
slope<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.510> front<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.070> front<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
slope you front of the front of the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.679 
slope you front of the front of the
chassis<00:00:29.429> which<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> covered<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> vanity

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
chassis which is covered with the vanity

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
chassis which is covered with the vanity
panel<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.619> nice<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> area

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
panel it's all very nice around the area

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.040 
panel it's all very nice around the area
and<00:00:32.850> they've<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.660> interesting

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and they've got a really interesting

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
and they've got a really interesting
front<00:00:34.500> wing<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.130> works<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.670> airflow

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
front wing that really works the airflow

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
front wing that really works the airflow
quite<00:00:36.210> hard<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
quite hard to get it out around the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.290 
quite hard to get it out around the
front<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> tires<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.910> again<00:00:39.120> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
front of the tires so again it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
front of the tires so again it's
probably<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> designer<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.739> expect<00:00:41.040> other

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
probably a designer we can expect other

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
probably a designer we can expect other
teams<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.760> start<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> copy<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> season

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
teams to start to copy as the season

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
teams to start to copy as the season
goes<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:44.300> going<00:00:45.300> back<00:00:45.450> towards<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> middle<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
goes by going back towards the middle of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.049 
goes by going back towards the middle of
the<00:00:46.200> car<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.710> obviously<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.489> saw<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> Ferrari

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the car now obviously we saw the Ferrari

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.819 
the car now obviously we saw the Ferrari
with<00:00:48.300> its<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.690> small<00:00:48.989> side<00:00:49.260> pods<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
with its very small side pods and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
with its very small side pods and
salaburu<00:00:50.430> followed<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:50.940> much<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> same<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
salaburu followed very much the same so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.900 
salaburu followed very much the same so
they've<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.739> high<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> wired<00:00:53.460> inlets

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
they've got very high and wired inlets

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.279 
they've got very high and wired inlets
but<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.329> quite<00:00:54.539> small<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.170> comparison

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
but they are quite small in comparison

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
but they are quite small in comparison
to<00:00:55.800> say<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.129> example<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.610> mclaren<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to say for example the mclaren or the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.990 
to say for example the mclaren or the
force<00:00:57.300> india<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.690> we've<00:00:57.840> seen<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.289> far<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
force india that we've seen so far and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580 
force india that we've seen so far and
that<00:01:00.000> rest<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> site<00:01:00.570> quad<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> really

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that rest of the site quad is really

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.549 
that rest of the site quad is really
shrunk<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> write<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.260> lots<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> sort

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
again at the rear of the car they've

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
again at the rear of the car they've
really<00:01:14.340> taken<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.909> sort<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> lots<00:01:15.450> of

the Ferrari rear end so it's not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.210 
the Ferrari rear end so it's not
surprising<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.530> they're<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:19.799> using<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
winglets above the exhaust as well so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
winglets above the exhaust as well so
lots<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.060> error<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> too<00:01:33.540> still<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> develop<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
lots of error is too still to develop on

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
lots of error is too still to develop on
the<00:01:34.590> samba<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the samba what do we think about the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
the samba what do we think about the
small<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.140> pods<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> Ferrari<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
small side pods on the Ferrari and the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
small side pods on the Ferrari and the
salver<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.850> Luke<00:01:39.000> Amari<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
salver do we think Luke Amari the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
salver do we think Luke Amari the
Ferrari<00:01:40.079> engine<00:01:40.320> designer<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> actually

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
Ferrari engine designer is actually

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
Ferrari engine designer is actually
coming<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.700> different<00:01:41.729> cooling<00:01:42.630> numbers

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
coming up with different cooling numbers

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
coming up with different cooling numbers
to<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.369> his<00:01:44.460> counterparts<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.180> Renault<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to to his counterparts at Renault and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830 
to to his counterparts at Renault and
Mercedes<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.430> interesting<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.329> clearly

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
Mercedes it's interesting for it clearly

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
Mercedes it's interesting for it clearly
we've<00:01:48.990> seen<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> Ferrari<00:01:50.130> engine<00:01:50.340> cars

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we've seen to the Ferrari engine cars

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
we've seen to the Ferrari engine cars
now<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> they're<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:52.020> fast<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.860> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
now and they're very much fast more on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.280 
now and they're very much fast more on
the<00:01:53.369> cooling<00:01:54.240> requirement<00:01:54.750> quite<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.259> but

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the cooling requirement quite there but

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.139 
the cooling requirement quite there but
other<00:01:55.500> cars<00:01:55.770> there's<00:01:56.399> talk<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.729> Ferrara

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
other cars there's talk about Ferrara

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
other cars there's talk about Ferrara
using<00:01:57.509> different<00:01:57.780> intercoolers<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:58.619> use

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
using different intercoolers which use

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.459 
using different intercoolers which use
on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.700> water<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:00.869> gets<00:02:01.049> called<00:02:01.350> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
on the water which then gets called in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.560 
on the water which then gets called in
the<00:02:01.560> radiators<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> sidepods<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.090> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the radiators in the sidepods and it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
the radiators in the sidepods and it's
also<00:02:03.659> talked<00:02:03.930> about<00:02:03.960> using<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:04.649> air

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
also talked about using a lot more air

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
also talked about using a lot more air
to<00:02:05.189> cool<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> electrical<00:02:06.149> elements<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.780> well

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to cool the electrical elements as well

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.600 
to cool the electrical elements as well
so<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.950> quite<00:02:08.069> interesting

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
so it's going to be quite interesting

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.800 
so it's going to be quite interesting
with<00:02:08.700> these<00:02:08.789> fineries<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.599> some<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
with these fineries get to see some of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.210 
with these fineries get to see some of
these<00:02:09.929> cars<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> bodywork<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.099> see

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
these cars with the bodywork off to see

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.589 
these cars with the bodywork off to see
exactly<00:02:11.489> what's<00:02:11.819> underneath<00:02:12.150> these<00:02:12.390> side

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
exactly what's underneath these side

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.810 
exactly what's underneath these side
pods
