because their bodyweight exercise and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.340 
because their bodyweight exercise and
that's<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.240> here<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> mean<00:02:17.780> gene

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
that's just what we do here I mean gene

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.949 
that's just what we do here I mean gene
so<00:02:19.630> rip<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:21.230> grip<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> bar<00:02:21.709> like<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.959> full

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
so rip like grip the bar like that full

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.500 
so rip like grip the bar like that full
range<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.319> motion<00:02:24.380> all<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> way<00:02:25.100> down<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
range of motion all the way down to the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.940 
range of motion all the way down to the
top<00:02:27.819> them<00:02:28.819> do<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:29.180> swing<00:02:29.690> your<00:02:29.870> upper<00:02:30.080> body<00:02:30.230> do

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
top them do not swing your upper body do

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.800 
top them do not swing your upper body do
not<00:02:31.100> swing<00:02:31.340> your<00:02:31.489> legs<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.030> we<00:02:32.239> do<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.510> do

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
not swing your legs so that we do not do

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.290 
not swing your legs so that we do not do
this<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:34.190> still<00:02:34.610> lower<00:02:34.819> body<00:02:35.380> up<00:02:37.120> hold<00:02:38.120> it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
this just still lower body up hold it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.370 
this just still lower body up hold it
like<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> second<00:02:38.870> at<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> top<00:02:39.550> up<00:02:40.959> as<00:02:41.959> many<00:02:42.230> as

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
like a second at the top up as many as

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.630 
like a second at the top up as many as
you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.819> then<00:02:43.819> right<00:02:44.690> after<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:46.370> into<00:02:46.519> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
you can then right after that go into a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.850 
you can then right after that go into a
push-up<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.810> get<00:02:47.989> your<00:02:48.140> triceps<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
push-up to get your triceps it's a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.710 
push-up to get your triceps it's a
triangle<00:02:49.310> push<00:02:49.459> up<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.030> hand<00:02:50.239> positioning

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
triangle push up so the hand positioning

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.410 
triangle push up so the hand positioning
and<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:51.590> beneath<00:02:51.800> your<00:02:51.890> shoulders<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.459> a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
you can take a 15 second break go right

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.130 
you can take a 15 second break go right
back<00:03:09.709> in<00:03:09.890> there<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.220> right<00:03:10.280> finally<00:03:11.239> we're

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
back in there all right finally we're

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.140 
back in there all right finally we're
gonna<00:03:12.230> finish<00:03:12.500> up<00:03:12.769> with<00:03:13.280> some<00:03:13.519> shoulder<00:03:13.819> stuff

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
gonna finish up with some shoulder stuff

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.759 
gonna finish up with some shoulder stuff
um<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.630> Arnold<00:03:17.989> press<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.560> then

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
um one is the Arnold press and then

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.140 
um one is the Arnold press and then
finally<00:03:19.010> we're<00:03:19.430> going<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.610> end<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:19.910> arm

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
finally we're going to end with arm

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.580 
finally we're going to end with arm
circles<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:23.060> yellow<00:03:23.180> press<00:03:23.570> was<00:03:23.840> coined<00:03:24.440> by

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
circles the yellow press was coined by

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.990 
circles the yellow press was coined by
all<00:03:24.860> swartz<00:03:25.370> nagar<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.500> he<00:03:28.130> used<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.519> get<00:03:28.940> a

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
all swartz nagar and he used it to get a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.660 
all swartz nagar and he used it to get a
lot<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.209> bulk<00:03:29.480> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.110> shoulders<00:03:30.500> because

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
lot of bulk in the shoulders because

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.270 
lot of bulk in the shoulders because
they<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:31.910> hit<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.390> new<00:03:32.630> rotation<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.680> your

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
they just hit a new rotation and your

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.069 
they just hit a new rotation and your
shoulders<00:03:34.430> are<00:03:34.640> very<00:03:34.670> versatile<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.959> this

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
shoulders are very versatile and this

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.630 
shoulders are very versatile and this
really<00:03:36.380> gets<00:03:36.560> them<00:03:36.820> most<00:03:37.820> parts<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.640> i'm

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
really gets them most parts of it so i'm

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.009 
really gets them most parts of it so i'm
using<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:41.000> resistance<00:03:41.390> band<00:03:41.450> because<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.930> an

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
using a resistance band because it's an

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.569 
using a resistance band because it's an
explosive<00:03:42.560> movement<00:03:42.950> in<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.160> i<00:03:43.280> think<00:03:43.340> it

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
explosive movement in it i think it

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.800 
explosive movement in it i think it
works<00:03:43.730> better<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.540> use<00:03:44.660> dumbbells

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
works better but you can use dumbbells

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.470 
works better but you can use dumbbells
as<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:45.230> for<00:03:45.530> well<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.489> start<00:03:46.940> out<00:03:47.090> with

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
as this for well so you start out with

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.220 
as this for well so you start out with
your<00:03:47.660> hands<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.019> then<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
your hands like this to you and then the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.849 
your hands like this to you and then the
rotation<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.970> up<00:03:54.010> up<00:03:55.010> like<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.560> 12<00:03:57.560> reps

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
rotation is up up like that so 12 reps

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.319 
rotation is up up like that so 12 reps
for<00:03:58.100> aim<00:03:58.250> for<00:03:58.400> 12<00:03:58.609> reps<00:03:58.820> 1<00:03:59.540> 2<00:04:00.380> 3<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.910> gets<00:04:02.120> your

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
for aim for 12 reps 1 2 3 this gets your

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.020 
for aim for 12 reps 1 2 3 this gets your
shoulders<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:03.019> well<00:04:03.170> as<00:04:03.290> dries<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.650> four<00:04:04.160> five

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
shoulders as well as dries it four five

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.770 
shoulders as well as dries it four five
six<00:04:06.019> seven<00:04:06.340> eight<00:04:07.989> until<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.079> get<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.320> 12<00:04:10.780> so

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
six seven eight until you get to 12 so

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.630 
six seven eight until you get to 12 so
remember<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.230> rotation<00:04:12.799> again<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.700> like<00:04:14.380> that

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
remember the rotation again is like that

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.390 
remember the rotation again is like that
you<00:04:16.640> want<00:04:16.820> straight<00:04:17.090> posture<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.840 

remember<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.490> breathe<00:04:22.760> out<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.390> effort<00:04:23.870> so

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
remember to breathe out on effort so

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.230 
remember to breathe out on effort so
finally<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:27.020> arm<00:04:27.410> circles<00:04:27.940> now<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.210> know

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
finally we have arm circles now I know

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.390 
finally we have arm circles now I know
I'm<00:04:29.540> only<00:04:29.630> using<00:04:29.840> 5<00:04:30.230> pounds<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:30.830> after<00:04:31.160> 30

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
I'm only using 5 pounds but after 30

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.460 
I'm only using 5 pounds but after 30
seconds<00:04:31.820> of<00:04:31.910> holding<00:04:32.900> your<00:04:33.020> arms<00:04:33.200> out<00:04:33.350> like

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
seconds of holding your arms out like

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.350 
seconds of holding your arms out like
this<00:04:34.180> each<00:04:35.180> way<00:04:35.830> each<00:04:36.830> direction<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.550> forward

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
this each way each direction so forward

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.160 
this each way each direction so forward
rotation<00:04:39.020> what<00:04:39.410> for<00:04:39.710> 30<00:04:39.920> seconds<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.170> then

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
rotation what for 30 seconds and then

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.930 
rotation what for 30 seconds and then
this<00:04:42.560> gets<00:04:42.740> really<00:04:43.100> heavy<00:04:43.280> after<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> while<00:04:43.790> I'm

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
this gets really heavy after a while I'm
