00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.410
 what is it I'm so or better known as 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.960
 falls recipe creations and today I bring you a 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.020
 video with a very cool theme that is the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.240
 Rare tricks of video games 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.300
 I'll start with a classic the super mario 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.360
 Bros a trick that sure you know is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.540
 that of level -1 which will see 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.540
 continuation 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.880
 in my opinion that trick is not very good 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.130
 Well, a lot of effort is made to 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.800
 meet with a water level that 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.830
 go very boring, let's continue with the super 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.900
 mariobros now with a trick which is 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.000
 the lives of 100 mario that 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.040
 get with just crushing one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 Turtle for even better 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.930
 idea of what I speak check what 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.820
 wrong video here is the true 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.820
 video of the 100 lives 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.990
 great this trick is very good but not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 It is very useful because it is only achieved 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.690
 being at a very advanced level but 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.660
 good let's continue with another trick this is the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.220
 super mario bros second the trick is very 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.220
 fool watch it 2 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.670
 hahaha who would like to have a turnip 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.940
 in the head 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.910
 oh yeah to the reggaetoneros let's continue with the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.310
 super mariobros third is a trick that 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.830
 makes in the final castle bowser not 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.830
 I hurt you I know what you do 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.090
 i 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.090
 here 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.349
 at least it helps to do that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.930
 I would really like to put that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.260
 good trick let's continue with one of my 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.390
 favorite games the yo yes island one of 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.390
 the most hopeless things about this 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.940
 game is that you leave the baby mario ok 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.580
 but the trick now is power to eat 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.849
 the baby mario and even turn it into 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.810
 egg I swear to you if you do not believe me see it 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.810
 yourselves 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.530
 or not 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.629
 yes 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.250
 I want to eat the baby piece of cash 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.400
 Mario, but I have to continue with the video 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.350
 the next trick is the same game but 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.200
 it's about being able to kill the boss of the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.490
 castle 3 without even fighting with him to 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.490
 follow the video 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.539
 ah 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.620
 hahaha I really liked the expression of 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.840
 came 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.720
 but good, let's continue with a game that 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.970
 sure you like it if I talk about the shock 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.370
 a dis and mogÃ¡n de facto san andreas 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.830
 they say there is a trick that makes 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.350
 everything melted this seemed very 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.470
 great but I did not find the video 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.350
 Well we fuck good, let's continue with 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.660
 the game sonic the hedgehog second the trick 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.920
 is to advance a long stretch with just 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.990
 crouch here the evidence this 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.880
 trick xdddd is applied looking 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.070
 completely down and then 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.820
 quickly jump on the screen 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.820
 You will see on the face down 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.780
 orals that trick is not so strange but 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.419
 which you will see below is very 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.880
 curious and scary because we will continue 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.639
 with a first- person classic if 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.070
 I speak for a second as the trick 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.320
 It attracted a lot of attention because it's about 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.110
 killing a game producer is 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.500
 pretty curious that's why here is the 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.500
 video 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.630
 with 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.570
 not 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.570
 two 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.130
 hahaha that's scary but pretty 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.610

00:06:53.130 --> 00:07:00.120
 video and yes and some thanks to 0
