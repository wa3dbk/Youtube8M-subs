when<00:03:41.950> dragon<00:03:42.370> sniping<00:03:42.790> because<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.630> can<00:03:43.840> you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
when dragon sniping because you can you

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.810 
when dragon sniping because you can you
get<00:03:44.049> taken<00:03:44.170> out<00:03:44.410> by<00:03:44.470> stuff<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.310> shoots<00:03:45.610> down

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
get taken out by stuff that shoots down

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.699 
get taken out by stuff that shoots down
air<00:03:46.150> support<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:47.140> gonna<00:03:47.350> see<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:47.590> we

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
air support but I'm gonna see if we

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.740 
air support but I'm gonna see if we
could<00:03:47.860> actually<00:03:48.070> do<00:03:48.430> some<00:03:48.640> damage<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
could actually do some damage on this

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.500 
could actually do some damage on this
catapults<00:03:50.560> without<00:03:50.950> getting<00:03:51.280> hurt<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:52.269> just

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
catapults without getting hurt we just

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.729 
catapults without getting hurt we just
our<00:03:52.600> dragon<00:03:53.049> because<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.320> catapults

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
our dragon because the catapults

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.890 
our dragon because the catapults
actually<00:03:54.100> do<00:03:54.519> nothing<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.180> dragon<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:55.780> we

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
actually do nothing to dragon so if we

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.780 
actually do nothing to dragon so if we
can<00:03:56.049> take<00:03:56.200> out<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.470> catapult<00:03:56.950> with<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.670> our

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
can take out this catapult with just our

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.270
