the<00:01:27.570> army<00:01:27.780> builder<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.650> hope<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:30.299> of

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the army builder I hope it's like one of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
the army builder I hope it's like one of
the<00:01:30.509> cheaper<00:01:30.869> sets<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> army

to know for sure
I<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> mask<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.540> though<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.930> think

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I like the mask on it though I think

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 
I like the mask on it though I think
that's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.530> pretty<00:02:04.920> cool<00:02:05.310> mask<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.320> then<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that's a pretty cool mask and then this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.249 
that's a pretty cool mask and then this
this

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
this

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.960 
this
and<00:02:08.349> then<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.769> is<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.979> packaging<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:09.700> this

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and then this is the packaging but this

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.720 
and then this is the packaging but this
next<00:02:10.299> one<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.019> big<00:02:11.290> reveal<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:12.370> big

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
next one this is the big reveal the big

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
next one this is the big reveal the big
one<00:02:12.939> of<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.150> wave<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.010> skull<00:02:15.819> grinder

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
one of the wave it's the skull grinder

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.259 
one of the wave it's the skull grinder
versus<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.560> mask<00:02:17.829> maker<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.579> think<00:02:18.939> this<00:02:19.120> is

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
versus the mask maker I think this is

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.509 
versus the mask maker I think this is
pretty<00:02:19.510> cool<00:02:19.750> looking<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.189> skull

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
pretty cool looking I like the skull

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.429 
pretty cool looking I like the skull
grinder<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> way<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> looks<00:02:22.810> how<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.230> looks

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
grinder the way it looks how it looks

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.220 
grinder the way it looks how it looks
like<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.890> made<00:02:24.220> out<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.459> volcano<00:02:25.180> how<00:02:26.079> it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
like it's made out of volcano how it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.350 
like it's made out of volcano how it's
got<00:02:26.349> all<00:02:26.470> those<00:02:26.620> translucent<00:02:27.370> orange<00:02:27.790> bits<00:02:28.150> on

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
got all those translucent orange bits on

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.270 
got all those translucent orange bits on
it<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.379> pretty<00:02:29.709> cool

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it I think that's pretty cool

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.309 
it I think that's pretty cool
and<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.090> even<00:02:31.360> comes<00:02:31.510> with<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.810> mask<00:02:32.049> maker

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319
