00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.870
 how much big cities do that for the individual 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.870
 was 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 from the publisher materials with all power 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.800
 it was fortunately no one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.539
 how hard was it then I will be like this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.170
 quickly after this defeat again 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170
 straighten 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.509
 I think that was the right one 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.390
 decision if i have an hour 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.300
 I have been watching completely but 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.399
 But physically I was 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.530
 was actually playing pretty well like that 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.760
 do you see your appearance in the single 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.980
 today against jo wilfried tsonga with 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.980
 each other's hour on the stand 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 somehow 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.080
 what would it take for this match? 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 maybe also to win 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:28.930
 i like to play the situation 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 do not take advantage of this sport 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.880
 come dictated immediately 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.900
 can play good that is already long 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.430
 no more was different before dreamed 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.760
 that one of the measures crate 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.760
 can be 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.010
 not solved 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.530
 but 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.610
 it is very complicated, of course 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.150
 do 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.120
 the money was 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.740
 as is 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.480
 Of course it was definitely one today 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 very good idea of you 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.820
 how much money do I believe it then mine 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 still day of such people the one 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:24.930
 already from the first day 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.680
 it was not my best performance though 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.680
 I have it with cramp 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.970
 yes, I hope so maintained 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:47.330
 You can not get into the game now 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 But play is set in any case is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.280
 in any case, now pleasing to the end 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.200
 went 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.670
 One hears of hundreds of groups is the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.670
 have been waiting in the hall 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.080
 Nobody collected honestly 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.080
 measured
