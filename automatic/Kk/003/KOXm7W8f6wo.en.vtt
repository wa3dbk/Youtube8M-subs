blown a cavern out of this nebula which

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.410 
blown a cavern out of this nebula which
is<00:02:08.929> why<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.319> can<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.739> down<00:02:09.979> into<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
is why we can see down into it the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.450 
is why we can see down into it the
brightest<00:02:11.870> star<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.320> called<00:02:12.680> theta<00:02:12.860> 1<00:02:13.190> C

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
brightest star is called theta 1 C

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.760 
brightest star is called theta 1 C
orianna's<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.420> about<00:02:14.630> 30<00:02:14.930> times<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.530> hour

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
orianna's it's about 30 times an hour

orianna's it's about 30 times an hour
the<00:02:15.890> sand<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.490> real<00:02:16.640> big<00:02:16.940> boy<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.870> it's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
the sand so it's a real big boy but it's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.110 
the sand so it's a real big boy but it's
just<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:18.650> star<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.910> thing<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
just that one star is the thing that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.150 
just that one star is the thing that
produces<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.930> eye<00:02:20.960> nebula<00:02:21.290> because<00:02:21.860> it's<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
produces the eye nebula because it's the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.010 
produces the eye nebula because it's the
hottest<00:02:22.340> star<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.090> most<00:02:23.300> massive<00:02:23.510> star<00:02:23.900> in

all this to glow we'll also see some

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.550 
all this to glow we'll also see some
interesting<00:03:37.610> some<00:03:38.000> jet-like<00:03:38.420> effects<00:03:38.959> that

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
interesting some jet-like effects that

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.320 
interesting some jet-like effects that
the<00:03:39.800> Hubble<00:03:39.980> telescope<00:03:40.190> causes<00:03:40.970> imaged

the Hubble telescope causes imaged

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.210 
the Hubble telescope causes imaged
incredibly<00:03:41.959> well<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.920> beautiful

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
incredibly well this is the beautiful

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.340 
incredibly well this is the beautiful
image<00:03:43.550> taken<00:03:43.910> by<00:03:44.030> an<00:03:44.120> amateur<00:03:44.660> astronomer<00:03:44.780> and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
image taken by an amateur astronomer and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.930 
image taken by an amateur astronomer and
we've<00:03:45.530> got<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.770> Ryan<00:03:46.010> but<00:03:46.400> looking<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.790> bit

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
we've got a Ryan but looking a bit

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.699 
we've got a Ryan but looking a bit
different<00:03:47.330> from<00:03:47.480> normal<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:48.380> it's<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
different from normal because it's a

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.490 
different from normal because it's a
very<00:03:48.890> deep<00:03:49.070> exposure<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:50.360> entire<00:03:50.810> region<00:03:51.080> is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
very deep exposure this entire region is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.610 
very deep exposure this entire region is
populated<00:03:52.190> by<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:52.310> huge<00:03:52.790> reservoir<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.690> cold

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
populated by this huge reservoir of cold

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.880 
populated by this huge reservoir of cold
molecular<00:03:55.520> gas<00:03:55.700> hydrogen<00:03:56.270> gas<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.320> the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
molecular gas hydrogen gas and so the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.890 
molecular gas hydrogen gas and so the
Ryan<00:03:58.130> Nebula<00:03:58.520> is<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:58.820> one<00:03:59.060> part<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.690> that

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
Ryan Nebula is just one part of that

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900 
Ryan Nebula is just one part of that
region<00:04:00.350> that's<00:04:00.920> forming<00:04:01.250> stars<00:04:01.520> but<00:04:01.790> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
region that's forming stars but the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.310 
region that's forming stars but the
other<00:04:02.060> regions<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.540> star<00:04:02.660> formation<00:04:02.900> will

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
other regions of star formation will

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.410 
other regions of star formation will
take<00:04:03.440> place<00:04:03.680> elsewhere<00:04:04.220> Narayan<00:04:05.060> in<00:04:05.330> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
take place elsewhere Narayan in the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.420 
take place elsewhere Narayan in the
coming<00:04:05.750> million<00:04:06.140> years<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:07.010> we<00:04:07.160> really<00:04:07.400> are

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
coming million years so we really are

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.820 
coming million years so we really are
looking<00:04:07.610> at<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.090> one<00:04:08.270> bit<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:09.290> giant

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
looking at just one bit of this giant

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.350 
looking at just one bit of this giant
reservoir<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.490> gas<00:04:10.670> that's<00:04:11.090> currently

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
reservoir of gas that's currently

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.050 
reservoir of gas that's currently
forming<00:04:11.720> stars<00:04:11.989> it's<00:04:12.620> only<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:13.250> few<00:04:13.850> light

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
forming stars it's only a few light

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.610 
forming stars it's only a few light
years<00:04:14.090> across<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.050> it's<00:04:15.170> really<00:04:15.320> quite<00:04:15.560> a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
years across so it's really quite a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.560 
years across so it's really quite a
small<00:04:15.860> place<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.120> close

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
small place it's just so close

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.360 
small place it's just so close
it<00:04:17.750> looks<00:04:17.930> quite<00:04:18.049> big<00:04:18.260> one<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.130> famous

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
it looks quite big one of the famous

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.849 
it looks quite big one of the famous
things<00:04:19.760> about<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.239> nebula<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:21.109> the

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
things about this nebula is the

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.800 
things about this nebula is the
protoplanetary<00:04:22.730> disc<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.480> it's<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:23.750> just

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
protoplanetary disc so it's not just

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.650 
protoplanetary disc so it's not just
stars<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.800> are<00:04:24.919> being<00:04:25.100> formed<00:04:25.460> but<00:04:26.180> possibly

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
stars that are being formed but possibly

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.650 
stars that are being formed but possibly
solar<00:04:27.050> systems<00:04:27.620> as<00:04:27.860> well<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.790> if<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:28.940> look

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
solar systems as well so if we look

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.510 
solar systems as well so if we look
the<00:04:29.930> m42<00:04:30.560> with<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.010> Hubble<00:04:31.160> Space<00:04:31.280> Telescope

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
the m42 with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.170 
the m42 with the Hubble Space Telescope
which<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:32.540> have<00:04:32.690> done<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:33.140> exquisite<00:04:33.800> detail

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
which they have done in exquisite detail

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.390 
which they have done in exquisite detail
you<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.390> see<00:04:35.660> these<00:04:35.900> protoplanetary<00:04:36.800> discs

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
you can see these protoplanetary discs

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.910 
you can see these protoplanetary discs
or<00:04:37.580> prep<00:04:38.180> lids<00:04:38.450> which<00:04:38.720> they're<00:04:38.960> called<00:04:39.200> which

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
or prep lids which they're called which

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.880 
or prep lids which they're called which
are<00:04:40.190> actually<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.970> very<00:04:41.390> earliest<00:04:41.930> stages<00:04:42.140> of

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
are actually the very earliest stages of

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.370 
are actually the very earliest stages of
a<00:04:43.310> solar<00:04:43.760> system<00:04:44.030> being<00:04:44.450> formed<00:04:44.900> around<00:04:45.230> a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
a solar system being formed around a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.550 
a solar system being formed around a
brand-new<00:04:46.160> hot<00:04:46.640> young<00:04:46.880> star<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.600> so<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.410> is

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
brand-new hot young star and so this is

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.080 
brand-new hot young star and so this is
a<00:04:48.880> disk<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.270> dust<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.530> debris<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.250> gas<00:04:52.820> that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
a disk of dust and debris and gas that

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.930 
a disk of dust and debris and gas that
is<00:04:53.300> likely<00:04:53.540> going<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:54.110> coalesce<00:04:54.620> into<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.670> solar

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
is likely going to coalesce into a solar

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.940 
is likely going to coalesce into a solar
system<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.990> fact<00:04:57.200> that<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.410> find<00:04:57.680> so

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
system and the fact that you find so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.490 
system and the fact that you find so
many<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.430> these<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.940> over<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> hundred<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.350> in

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
many of these so over a hundred just in

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.920 
many of these so over a hundred just in
the<00:05:00.590> Orion<00:05:00.710> Nebula<00:05:01.250> sort<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:02.030> indicates<00:05:02.630> that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
the Orion Nebula sort of indicates that

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.810 
the Orion Nebula sort of indicates that
the<00:05:03.320> formation<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.040> solar<00:05:04.220> system<00:05:04.700> is

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
the formation of the solar system is

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.210 
the formation of the solar system is
probably<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.390> fairly<00:05:05.720> common<00:05:06.290> thing<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:06.830> it

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
probably a fairly common thing so it

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.740 
probably a fairly common thing so it
gives<00:05:07.400> us<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.640> little<00:05:07.760> bit<00:05:07.910> of<00:05:08.030> perspective<00:05:08.270> on

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
gives us a little bit of perspective on

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.750 
gives us a little bit of perspective on
where<00:05:08.930> we<00:05:09.110> lie<00:05:09.650> in<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.130> universe<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.700> how

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
where we lie in the universe and how

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.880 
where we lie in the universe and how
special<00:05:11.030> we<00:05:11.330> are<00:05:11.360> which<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.200> probably<00:05:12.800> not

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
special we are which is probably not

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.490 
special we are which is probably not

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.730 
and the pink things here are things like
a<00:05:25.880> Ryan<00:05:26.240> if<00:05:26.720> that's<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.990> Ryan's<00:05:27.350> going<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.620> be

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
a Ryan if that's a Ryan's going to be

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.590 
a Ryan if that's a Ryan's going to be
kind<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.370> fairy<00:05:28.550> piddly<00:05:28.940> one<00:05:29.090> more<00:05:29.480> like

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
kind of a fairy piddly one more like

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.040 
kind of a fairy piddly one more like
that<00:05:29.720> one

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
that one

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.650 
that one
so<00:05:30.290> really<00:05:30.470> Orion<00:05:30.950> is<00:05:31.280> just<00:05:31.610> one<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.420> many

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
so really Orion is just one of many

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.780 
so really Orion is just one of many
regions<00:05:33.260> of<00:05:33.410> star<00:05:33.590> formation<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.520> Milky

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
regions of star formation in the Milky

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.220 
regions of star formation in the Milky
Way<00:05:34.820> it's<00:05:35.360> just<00:05:35.570> it's<00:05:35.780> just<00:05:35.960> for<00:05:36.110> us<00:05:36.200> it's

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
Way it's just it's just for us it's

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.260 
Way it's just it's just for us it's
really<00:05:36.440> close<00:05:36.800> by

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.330
