 create 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 presented a range 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 So aesthetic friends are 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.189
 photo applications of

 removal tattoos 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.450
 hey raga but rather like 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 to all Italian

 for about twenty years 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.050
 ooh wide 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.510
 tends to cover the whole part a little 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.430
 aesthetic medicine this congress we thought presented 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.840
 eurican particular these innovations concern the possibility of combining 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.350
 the sources some 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.370
 the platforms 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.080
 of a single machine to offer used the ability to do 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840
 source more applications 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.530
 it was with limited investments because 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.040

 at 360 degrees its activity inside 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.090
 configured according to need 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.659
 one of the options that can be implemented within the subject 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.610
 both in the first instance that it is subsequently without anyone 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.850
 technical intervention but simply 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.300
 few user 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 ohoh purchase owes options 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.130
 which implements arl 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.500
 wall machine jap responsibility you also offer the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840
 Possibility of 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.660
 partialize the investment especially for those people who start the business 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.810
 and therefore clearly wants 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.960
 investments to a minimum in order to eventually expand, expand
