crusher thing because I like to do lots
of<00:05:27.470> cooking<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.700> was<00:05:28.820> essential<00:05:29.330> for<00:05:29.360> me<00:05:29.630> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
of cooking so it was essential for me to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.570 
of cooking so it was essential for me to
have<00:05:30.310> workspace<00:05:31.310> in<00:05:32.500> that's<00:05:33.500> just<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.950> keep<00:05:34.310> my

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
have workspace in that's just I keep my

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.050

food and my normal rubbish separate just

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.980 
food and my normal rubbish separate just
because<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.300> find<00:05:38.510> it's<00:05:38.660> more<00:05:38.840> hygienic

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
because I find it's more hygienic

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.240 
because I find it's more hygienic
especially<00:05:39.620> because<00:05:39.710> we're<00:05:39.890> in<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.070> heat

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
especially because we're in the heat

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.100 
especially because we're in the heat
here<00:05:40.580> so<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.240> easier<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.720> just<00:05:41.870> turn

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
here so it's easier to just turn

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.409 
here so it's easier to just turn
everything<00:05:42.290> into<00:05:43.070> there<00:05:43.460> as<00:05:43.640> I'm<00:05:43.790> cooking<00:05:44.210> and

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
everything into there as I'm cooking and

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.640 
everything into there as I'm cooking and
then<00:05:44.660> just<00:05:44.930> throw<00:05:45.229> it<00:05:45.380> away

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
then just throw it away

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.409 
then just throw it away
um<00:05:46.370> after<00:05:47.240> um<00:05:47.890> cookers<00:05:48.890> don't<00:05:49.729> really<00:05:50.180> have

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419
