00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.540 

the<00:00:00.450> technical<00:00:00.810> dangers<00:00:01.110> are<00:00:01.199> not<00:00:01.319> trivial

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:01.550 
the technical dangers are not trivial

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.200 
the technical dangers are not trivial
and<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.389> think<00:00:03.560> that<00:00:04.759> you<00:00:05.759> should<00:00:05.970> not

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
and and I think that you should not

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.839 
and and I think that you should not
expose<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.080> future<00:00:07.529> human<00:00:07.830> being<00:00:08.040> willingly<00:00:08.429> to

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
expose a future human being willingly to

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.839 
expose a future human being willingly to
the<00:00:08.940> dangers<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:10.340> know<00:00:11.340> about<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the dangers that we know about and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.910 
the dangers that we know about and
indeed<00:00:11.969> those<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.570> unknown<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.650> don't

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
indeed those that are unknown we don't

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.919 
indeed those that are unknown we don't
know<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.340> example<00:00:14.820> whether<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.630> cloned

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
know for example whether the cloned

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.929 
know for example whether the cloned
being<00:00:16.650> would<00:00:17.960> have<00:00:18.960> genetic<00:00:19.410> damage<00:00:19.939> there's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
being would have genetic damage there's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.320 
being would have genetic damage there's
evidence<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.570> Dolly's<00:00:22.470> DNA<00:00:23.029> which<00:00:24.029> came

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
evidence that Dolly's DNA which came

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.830 
evidence that Dolly's DNA which came
originally<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.189> donor<00:00:26.400> sheep<00:00:26.789> did<00:00:27.630> not

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
originally from the donor sheep did not

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
originally from the donor sheep did not
get<00:00:28.109> fully<00:00:28.470> repaired<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> embryonic

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
get fully repaired in the embryonic

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.510 
get fully repaired in the embryonic
State<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.369> had

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
State and so it was as if it had

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.569 
State and so it was as if it had
accumulated<00:00:32.940> damage<00:00:33.660> over<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.500> six<00:00:34.770> years<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
accumulated damage over the six years we

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
accumulated damage over the six years we
don't<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.090> universal<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.989> we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
don't know how universal that is we

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
don't know how universal that is we
really<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:38.300> with<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.510> animals<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
really do not know with some animals it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.619 
really do not know with some animals it
may<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.129> we're<00:00:41.579> exposing<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.329> future

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
may not be so so we're exposing a future

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.139 
may not be so so we're exposing a future
human<00:00:42.930> being<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.559> unknown<00:00:43.829> risks<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.910> think

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
human being to unknown risks and I think

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
human being to unknown risks and I think
those<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.600> trivial<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.770> even<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.190> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
those are not trivial but even if we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.600 
those are not trivial but even if we
could<00:00:47.399> overcome<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:49.039> my<00:00:50.039> own<00:00:50.160> feeling<00:00:50.460> about

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
could overcome that my own feeling about

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
could overcome that my own feeling about
trying<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> create<00:00:51.270> another<00:00:51.480> human<00:00:51.870> being<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
trying to create another human being is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
trying to create another human being is
that<00:00:52.440> whose<00:00:52.829> image<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> trying<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.699> create<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that whose image you trying to create it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.139 
that whose image you trying to create it
in<00:00:54.329> why<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> selected<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> genotype

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
in why have you selected that genotype

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
in why have you selected that genotype
is<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> sheer<00:00:57.890> hubris

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
is it sheer hubris

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
is it sheer hubris
you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:01.020> like

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you know that you want to you want like

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
you know that you want to you want like
in<00:01:01.949> dr.<00:01:02.579> Frankenstein<00:01:04.400> who<00:01:05.400> wanted<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> take

in dr. Frankenstein who wanted to take

in dr. Frankenstein who wanted to take
on<00:01:06.810> such<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> lofty<00:01:07.350> motive<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.890> creating

on such a lofty motive as creating

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.200 
on such a lofty motive as creating
another<00:01:08.580> human

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
another human

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
arrogance is it that you've got some

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
arrogance is it that you've got some
other<00:01:13.350> motive<00:01:15.350> when<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.619> Dolly<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.040> cloned

other motive when when Dolly was cloned

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
other motive when when Dolly was cloned
many<00:01:17.850> many<00:01:18.330> people<00:01:18.869> said<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:19.770> wanted

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
many many people said that they wanted

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.660 
many many people said that they wanted
to<00:01:20.540> clone<00:01:21.540> their<00:01:21.750> loved<00:01:21.930> ones<00:01:22.670> including

Richard Dawkins who they wanted to clone
himself<00:01:27.409> sad<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.650> won't<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> won't<00:01:29.159> clone

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
himself sad you won't you won't clone
yourself<00:01:29.729> you're<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> genetic<00:01:31.110> copy

yourself you're to make a genetic copy
of<00:01:31.500> yourself<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of yourself and so that what you make is

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.460 
of yourself and so that what you make is
a<00:01:33.150> genetic<00:01:33.570> copy<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> copy<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> the

a genetic copy but not a copy of the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.980 
a genetic copy but not a copy of the
person<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:36.560> why<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> doing<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.990> have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
person but why are you doing this have

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
person but why are you doing this have
you<00:01:40.110> identified<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.860> set<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.189> genes

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you identified this set of genes

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
you identified this set of genes
something<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.720> preserve<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
something that you want to preserve it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
something that you want to preserve it
seems<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.189> we're<00:01:44.340> doing<00:01:44.610> here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
seems to me that what we're doing here

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.999 
seems to me that what we're doing here
is<00:01:45.030> where<00:01:45.270> we're<00:01:45.780> turning<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.259> child<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.979> be

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
is where we're turning that child to be

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.440 
is where we're turning that child to be
into<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> sheer<00:01:48.770> expression<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> our<00:01:50.100> wishes<00:01:50.450> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
into a sheer expression of our wishes a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.080 
into a sheer expression of our wishes a
commodity<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.799> very<00:01:53.189> significant<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
commodity in a very very significant and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.300 
commodity in a very very significant and
real<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> sake<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
real way so I think for the sake of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.639 
real way so I think for the sake of
arrogance<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.700> sake<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.390> like

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
arrogance and the sake of if you like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
arrogance and the sake of if you like
wishful<00:02:01.649> thinking<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> sake<00:02:03.329> of
