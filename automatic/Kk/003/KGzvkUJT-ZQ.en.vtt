and all this other crap clone CDs one of
the<00:01:52.140> best<00:01:52.319> programs<00:01:52.560> works<00:01:53.220> great<00:01:53.959> very<00:01:54.959> easy

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the best programs works great very easy

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.999 
the best programs works great very easy
to<00:01:55.409> use

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to use

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
to use
it<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.149> doesn't<00:01:57.360> require<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.929> more

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it really doesn't require to the more

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.340 
it really doesn't require to the more
settings<00:01:59.330> okay<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.630> took<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:00.959> seven

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
settings okay so that's took about seven

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
settings okay so that's took about seven
minutes<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.709> total<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.039> burn<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.429> acted<00:02:02.759> ISO

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
minutes in total to burn that acted ISO

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.449

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
EVD next I'm going to show you a way for

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.029 
EVD next I'm going to show you a way for
game<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't<00:02:06.659> start<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.319> then<00:02:07.440> me

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
game how it doesn't start and then me

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.250 
game how it doesn't start and then me

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
using the active ISO DVD to go ahead and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
using the active ISO DVD to go ahead and
bypass<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.040> am<00:02:14.519> able<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.880> play

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
bypass that so that I am able to play

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that way flowing game so you can see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.039 
that way flowing game so you can see
right<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.549> game<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.239> further<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
right here the game on going further it

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.780 
right here the game on going further it
just<00:02:19.260> stops<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.100> type<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.310> job<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.579> I
