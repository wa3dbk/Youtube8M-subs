then with new matches you will get to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.370 
then with new matches you will get to
the<00:00:27.480> point<00:00:27.689> where<00:00:27.810> you're<00:00:27.900> seeing<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> same

other people can view them it's kind of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
other people can view them it's kind of
how<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.530> works<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
how this works and you can also do the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
how this works and you can also do the
same<00:01:09.390> thing<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.900> stages<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> me<00:01:11.760> fighters

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
same thing for stages and me fighters

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
same thing for stages and me fighters
and<00:01:12.330> snapshots<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.200> how<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.590> works

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and snapshots so that's how this works

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
and snapshots so that's how this works
you<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.250> send<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.450> be

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you have to send before they can be

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
you have to send before they can be
viewed<00:01:15.869> by<00:01:15.990> anyone<00:01:16.170> else<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.860> keep<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
viewed by anyone else so keep that in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.130 
viewed by anyone else so keep that in
mind<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> View

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
mind and then this is how the View

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
mind and then this is how the View
function<00:01:19.560> works<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.420> select

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
function works so you go in you select

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
function works so you go in you select
your<00:01:22.080> parameters<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> choose<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
your parameters you can choose the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
your parameters you can choose the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.630 
download your own I don't know maybe to
check<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.890> shared<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.430> think

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
check what you have shared I think

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
check what you have shared I think
that's<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> reason<00:01:36.450> why<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.840> then

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that's probably the reason why and then

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
that's probably the reason why and then
you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.500> edit<00:01:37.590> yeah<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.220> go

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you can go and edit yeah there we go

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
you can go and edit yeah there we go
that<00:01:38.640> makes<00:01:38.820> sense<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.150> alright<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that makes sense actually alright you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 
that makes sense actually alright you
have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> friends<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.159> anyone<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.270> friends

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
have a friends and anyone so for friends
the<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> works<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.369> people<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the way it works is if people on your

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
the way it works is if people on your
friends<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.240> stuff<00:01:45.540> shared<00:01:45.930> then

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
friends just have stuff shared then

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
friends just have stuff shared then
those<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.710> show<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can't<00:01:47.430> really

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
those will show up and you can't really

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.219 
those will show up and you can't really
edit<00:01:47.759> any<00:01:48.060> other<00:01:48.240> parameters<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.049> kind

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
edit any other parameters it just kind

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
edit any other parameters it just kind
of<00:01:49.290> gives<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> dump<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:51.030> friends

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of gives you a dump of what your friends

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200 
of gives you a dump of what your friends
list<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:52.649> sharing<00:01:53.280> when<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> comes

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
list is sharing when it comes

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380 
list is sharing when it comes
place<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.830> does<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.030> search<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> can

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
place so then it does a search it can

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
place so then it does a search it can
take<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> long<00:01:57.869> time<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.260> as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.830> see<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.220> many

take a long time and as you see not many

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
take a long time and as you see not many
people<00:01:59.580> are<00:01:59.760> sharing<00:02:00.060> replaced<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.900> don't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
people are sharing replaced so I don't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
people are sharing replaced so I don't
really<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> lot<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.670> a

really have a lot to do but this is a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.920 
really have a lot to do but this is a
one<00:02:03.210> b<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.930> then<00:02:04.530> sm64<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.420> luck<00:02:06.690> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
one b one so then sm64 you are in luck I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.529 
one b one so then sm64 you are in luck I
will<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.670> getting<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.850> replay<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> way

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
will be getting this replay and the way

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.090 
will be getting this replay and the way
it<00:02:09.690> works<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> downloads<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> replay<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it works is it downloads the replay to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.670 
it works is it downloads the replay to
your<00:02:11.640> vault<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> downloads<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.350> as<00:02:13.470> if

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
your vault so it downloads that as if

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
your vault so it downloads that as if
it's<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> replay<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:14.700> own<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's a replay of your own you get the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's a replay of your own you get the
spazzy<00:02:16.230> looking<00:02:16.590> download<00:02:17.370> bar<00:02:17.610> which

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
spazzy looking download bar which

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.309 
spazzy looking download bar which
doesn't<00:02:18.180> look<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.690> from<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> game

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
doesn't look like it's from this game

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.830 
doesn't look like it's from this game
but<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.739> go<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
but there we go and it's just in the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.300 
but there we go and it's just in the
vault<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.380> got<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.739> back<00:02:22.950> there

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
vault and then you got to go back there

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.240 
vault and then you got to go back there
but<00:02:23.489> normally<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.780> your<00:02:24.989> search<00:02:25.830> results

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
but normally if if your search results

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.800 
but normally if if your search results
that<00:02:26.310> yield<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.760> lot<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> results<00:02:27.300> let's<00:02:27.660> just

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that yield a lot of results let's just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.100 
that yield a lot of results let's just
do<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.019> normal<00:02:28.320> search<00:02:28.769> with<00:02:29.400> everything<00:02:30.110> and

like<00:02:35.790> what<00:02:36.090> your<00:02:36.300> replay<00:02:37.340> library<00:02:38.340> looks<00:02:38.580> like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
like what your replay library looks like

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.090 
like what your replay library looks like
when<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.030> chock-full<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.959> replays<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
when it's chock-full of replays and you

does take a wild though it can take a
minute<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.100> had<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> take<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> minute

first or if it's kind of doing a random

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.390 
first or if it's kind of doing a random
selection<00:03:13.079> which<00:03:13.560> might<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.100> reason<00:03:14.370> for

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
selection which might be the reason for

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.759 
selection which might be the reason for
why<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.150> taking<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.480> long<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.590> want

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
why it's taking so long if you do want

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.039 
why it's taking so long if you do want
to<00:03:16.829> narrow<00:03:17.070> down<00:03:17.220> your<00:03:17.280> your<00:03:17.970> search<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.870> does

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
to narrow down your your search it does

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.250 
to narrow down your your search it does
give<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> lot<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.829> options<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.549> narrow<00:03:21.420> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
give you a lot of options to narrow it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.350 
give you a lot of options to narrow it
down<00:03:22.290> by<00:03:22.739> stages<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.430> characters<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.030> such

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
down by stages and characters and such

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.440 
down by stages and characters and such
but<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.750> by<00:03:24.900> date<00:03:25.170> which<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> little<00:03:26.450> you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
but not by date which is a little you

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.819 
but not by date which is a little you
know<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.930> kind<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.230> sucks<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.590> actually

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
know that kind of sucks it actually

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.199 
know that kind of sucks it actually
doesn't<00:03:29.100> tell<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.549> date<00:03:29.760> actually<00:03:30.120> of

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
doesn't tell you the date actually of

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.110 
doesn't tell you the date actually of
the<00:03:30.299> replays<00:03:30.600> at<00:03:30.750> all<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:32.040> oh<00:03:32.370> no<00:03:32.459> there<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the replays at all so is oh no there it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.580 
the replays at all so is oh no there it
tells<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.840> date<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.170> not<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> time<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
tells you the date but not the time I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.250 
tells you the date but not the time I
think<00:03:34.739> that's<00:03:34.920> normal<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.940> smaller<00:03:36.269> than<00:03:36.600> I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
think that's normal it's smaller than I

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.410 
think that's normal it's smaller than I
think<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.590> remember

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
think I remember

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.880 
think I remember
anyways<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.379> realize<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.769> see

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
anyways this is the the realize you see

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.740 
anyways this is the the realize you see
up<00:03:40.980> then<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.310> number<00:03:41.519> at<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.730> top<00:03:41.940> says<00:03:42.150> 100

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
up then the number at the top says 100

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.570 
up then the number at the top says 100
so<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:42.989> are<00:03:43.110> 100<00:03:43.800> replays<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.430> if<00:03:44.489> you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
so there are 100 replays here if you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.589 
so there are 100 replays here if you
want<00:03:44.760> more<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.120> gonna<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> narrow

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
want more you're gonna have to narrow

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.979 
want more you're gonna have to narrow
down<00:03:45.750> your<00:03:45.810> search<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.640> yeah<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:48.000> you

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
down your search and yeah so you

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.900 
down your search and yeah so you
basically<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.470> go<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.890> select<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.610> say

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
basically just go you select it to say

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.119 
basically just go you select it to say
get<00:03:51.180> replay<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.870> then<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.560> adds<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.010> your

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
get replay and then it adds it to your

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.780 
get replay and then it adds it to your
bank<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.580> let's<00:03:53.760> get<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.120> one<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:55.790> they're

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
bank so let's get this one and they're

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.520 
bank so let's get this one and they're
as<00:03:57.180> easy<00:03:57.360> as<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.840> downloads<00:03:58.200> pretty

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
as easy as that it downloads pretty

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.380 
as easy as that it downloads pretty
quick<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.489> Bennets<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.879> your<00:04:00.000> vault<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
quick in the Bennets in your vault and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.360 
quick in the Bennets in your vault and
then<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.569> go<00:04:00.720> back<00:04:00.870> there<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.190> way<00:04:02.310> you

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
then you go back there so the way you

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.740 
then you go back there so the way you
probably<00:04:02.940> want<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.599> don't<00:04:03.629> have

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
probably want to do it so you don't have

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.030 
probably want to do it so you don't have
to<00:04:03.870> go<00:04:03.959> back<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.290> forth<00:04:04.500> because<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.830> have<00:04:04.950> to

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
to go back and forth because you have to

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.710 
to go back and forth because you have to
leave<00:04:05.190> online<00:04:05.670> mode<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:06.299> go<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> your

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
leave online mode to then go to your

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.509 
leave online mode to then go to your
vault<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.890> good<00:04:08.010> idea<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.340> to

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
vault so it's a good idea just to

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.979 
vault so it's a good idea just to
download<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> bunch<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.660> through

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
download a bunch you just go through

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.589 
download a bunch you just go through
download<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.680> then<00:04:10.980> watch<00:04:11.280> them<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.910> it's

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
download and then watch them and it's

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.780 
download and then watch them and it's
cool<00:04:12.780> because<00:04:12.810> there's<00:04:13.410> also<00:04:13.590> these<00:04:14.400> kinds<00:04:14.760> of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
cool because there's also these kinds of

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.099 
cool because there's also these kinds of
replays<00:04:15.120> replays<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.780> know<00:04:15.870> who<00:04:15.989> we

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
replays replays that you know who we

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.890 
replays replays that you know who we
can't<00:04:16.380> couldn't<00:04:17.130> watch<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.900> that's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
can't couldn't watch and that's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.449 
can't couldn't watch and that's
basically<00:04:19.500> how<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.709> works<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:19.979> also<00:04:20.160> view

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
basically how it works you can also view

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.940 
basically how it works you can also view
someone's<00:04:20.850> profile<00:04:21.359> within<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.740> check

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
someone's profile within this you check

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.620 
someone's profile within this you check

want to here with the world you do have
to<00:04:42.600> hit<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.960> share<00:04:43.260> button<00:04:43.370> go<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.610> menu

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
to hit the share button go to that menu

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.960 
to hit the share button go to that menu
and<00:04:44.970> select<00:04:45.479> what<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.840> want<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.229> upload<00:04:46.970> there

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
and select what you want to upload there

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.170 
and select what you want to upload there
is<00:04:48.090> also<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.840> stage<00:04:49.789> sharing<00:04:50.789> which<00:04:51.150> is

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
is also the stage sharing which is

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.230 
is also the stage sharing which is
awesome<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.500> allows<00:04:52.830> me<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.210> do<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
awesome because that allows me to do a

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.430 
awesome because that allows me to do a
staged<00:04:55.789> custom<00:04:56.789> stage<00:04:57.090> series<00:04:57.660> so<00:04:57.930> let's<00:04:58.200> just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
staged custom stage series so let's just

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.810 
staged custom stage series so let's just
look<00:04:58.620> at<00:04:58.830> everyone's<00:04:59.610> stages<00:05:00.090> in<00:05:00.330> Canada<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
look at everyone's stages in Canada and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.100 
look at everyone's stages in Canada and
show<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.880> what<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.360> looks<00:05:03.630> like<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.840> this

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
show you what this looks like so this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.219 
show you what this looks like so this
also<00:05:04.410> functions<00:05:05.190> similarly<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.789> the<00:05:06.389> replay

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
also functions similarly to the replay

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.500 
also functions similarly to the replay
sharing<00:05:07.680> function<00:05:08.130> in<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.180> have<00:05:09.330> to

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
sharing function in that you have to

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.170 
sharing function in that you have to
save<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.530> stage<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.130> your<00:05:11.280> own<00:05:11.460> device<00:05:11.880> and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
save this stage to your own device and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.730 
save this stage to your own device and
then<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.389> have<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.930> doesn't<00:05:13.080> auto<00:05:13.320> update

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
then you have it it doesn't auto update

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.650 
then you have it it doesn't auto update
if<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:14.130> if<00:05:14.370> they<00:05:14.610> change<00:05:15.000> their<00:05:15.210> stage<00:05:15.510> or

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
if that if they change their stage or

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.300 
if that if they change their stage or
won't<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.840> changed<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:16.289> yours<00:05:16.470> not<00:05:16.740> syncing<00:05:17.190> in

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
won't be changed on yours not syncing in

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.219 
won't be changed on yours not syncing in
any<00:05:17.430> way<00:05:17.610> you're<00:05:18.090> just<00:05:18.270> downloading<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.930> file

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.409 
any way you're just downloading a file
essentially<00:05:19.950> here's<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.060> blade

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419

essentially here's one of a blade
there's<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.229> corn<00:05:22.680> area<00:05:22.889> or<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.099> shark<00:05:23.870> death

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
there's a corn area or a shark death

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.800 
there's a corn area or a shark death
mountain<00:05:25.110> pond<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:27.240> lot<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.450> cool<00:05:27.599> things

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
mountain pond and a lot of cool things

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.560 
mountain pond and a lot of cool things
the<00:05:27.990> great<00:05:28.200> eye<00:05:28.229> from<00:05:28.740> Lord<00:05:29.039> of<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.130> Rings

the great eye from Lord of the Rings
this<00:05:30.570> one<00:05:30.750> looks<00:05:30.930> pretty<00:05:31.020> cool<00:05:31.349> I've<00:05:31.560> seen<00:05:31.710> it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
this one looks pretty cool I've seen it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.830 
this one looks pretty cool I've seen it
before<00:05:31.889> there<00:05:32.160> we<00:05:32.310> go<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.700> yeah<00:05:33.450> that's<00:05:33.780> how

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
before there we go and yeah that's how

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.779 
before there we go and yeah that's how
the<00:05:33.930> stage<00:05:34.320> sharing<00:05:34.979> works<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:35.370> do<00:05:35.460> have<00:05:35.639> to

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
the stage sharing works you do have to

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.990 
the stage sharing works you do have to
select<00:05:35.970> your<00:05:36.120> stages<00:05:36.539> to<00:05:36.660> be<00:05:36.810> shared

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
select your stages to be shared

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.190 
select your stages to be shared
similarly<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.210> how<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.419> do<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:39.930> replays

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
similarly to how you do it for replays

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.510 
similarly to how you do it for replays
and<00:05:40.349> that's<00:05:40.530> just<00:05:40.710> how<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:40.860> works<00:05:41.250> so

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
and that's just how that works so

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.159 
and that's just how that works so
hopefully<00:05:42.150> found<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.419> informative<00:05:42.780> and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
hopefully found this informative and

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.510 
hopefully found this informative and
interesting<00:05:43.620> I'll<00:05:43.889> be<00:05:44.010> doing<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.310> lot<00:05:44.460> of

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
interesting I'll be doing a lot of

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.310 
interesting I'll be doing a lot of
sharing<00:05:45.479> based<00:05:45.810> videos<00:05:46.349> from<00:05:46.950> now

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
sharing based videos from now

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.840 
sharing based videos from now
on<00:05:47.380> because<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:47.920> think<00:05:47.980> this<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> really<00:05:48.610> cool

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
on because I think this is a really cool

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.930 
on because I think this is a really cool
sort<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.600> tool<00:05:50.110> especially<00:05:50.560> for<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:51.340> caster

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
sort of a tool especially for a caster

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.870 
sort of a tool especially for a caster
and<00:05:52.090> commentator<00:05:52.600> like<00:05:53.410> myself<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.640> I'll<00:05:54.760> be

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
and commentator like myself so I'll be

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.550 
and commentator like myself so I'll be
starting<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.360> series<00:05:55.630> called<00:05:55.840> smash<00:05:56.140> cast

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
starting the series called smash cast

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.260 
starting the series called smash cast
I'm<00:05:56.860> going<00:05:57.400> to<00:05:57.460> be<00:05:57.550> premiering<00:05:57.850> that<00:05:58.060> it's

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
I'm going to be premiering that it's

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.780 
I'm going to be premiering that it's
gonna<00:05:58.480> be<00:05:58.690> basically<00:05:59.410> using<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.400> sharing

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
gonna be basically using the sharing

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.600 
gonna be basically using the sharing
feature<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.450> not<00:06:02.140> being<00:06:02.500> bound<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:03.280> the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
feature and not being bound to the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.970 
feature and not being bound to the
replay<00:06:03.910> channel<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.540> its<00:06:04.720> limitations<00:06:05.470> it

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
replay channel and its limitations it

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.480 
replay channel and its limitations it
lets<00:06:06.340> me<00:06:06.490> select<00:06:06.700> replays<00:06:07.540> and<00:06:08.250> cast<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:09.430> a

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
lets me select replays and cast it a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.130 
lets me select replays and cast it a
little<00:06:09.670> more<00:06:09.850> organically<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.720> choosing

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
little more organically and choosing

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.070 
little more organically and choosing
replays<00:06:11.500> based<00:06:11.890> on<00:06:12.100> how<00:06:13.060> I<00:06:13.090> want<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.510> show<00:06:13.840> them

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
replays based on how I want to show them

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.330 
replays based on how I want to show them
or<00:06:14.230> which<00:06:14.500> matches<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:14.950> want<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.220> watch

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
or which matches I want to watch

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.490 
or which matches I want to watch
specifically<00:06:16.330> or<00:06:16.420> certain<00:06:16.690> matchups<00:06:16.870> even

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
specifically or certain matchups even

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500 
specifically or certain matchups even
and<00:06:17.710> yeah<00:06:18.280> that's<00:06:18.490> how<00:06:18.670> this<00:06:18.820> works<00:06:19.060> so<00:06:19.180> I<00:06:19.270> hope

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
and yeah that's how this works so I hope

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.090 
and yeah that's how this works so I hope
