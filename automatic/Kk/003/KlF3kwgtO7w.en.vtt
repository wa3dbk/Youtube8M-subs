00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
even a week ago like four or five days

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.889 
even a week ago like four or five days
ago<00:01:58.729> when<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:58.970> actually<00:01:59.200> started<00:02:00.200> back<00:02:00.500> up<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
ago when I actually started back up the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.630 
ago when I actually started back up the
xbox<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.439> play<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.130> that's<00:02:04.280> why<00:02:04.490> I'm

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
xbox to go and play but that's why I'm

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.510 
xbox to go and play but that's why I'm
using<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:05.000> choppers<00:02:05.360> on<00:02:05.479> me<00:02:05.570> now<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.369> really<00:02:07.369> do

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
using the choppers on me now I really do

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.790 
using the choppers on me now I really do
prefer<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.090> ac-130<00:02:08.630> even<00:02:09.349> though<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.619> feel

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
prefer the ac-130 even though I do feel

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.380 
prefer the ac-130 even though I do feel
like<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.250> chopper<00:02:10.519> gunner<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.819> does<00:02:10.970> get<00:02:11.180> more

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
like the chopper gunner it does get more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900 
like the chopper gunner it does get more
kills<00:02:11.569> sometimes<00:02:12.110> but<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.519> video<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
way this is almost the same that class

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.530 
way this is almost the same that class
that<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.319> got<00:02:27.470> my<00:02:27.560> first<00:02:27.830> nuke<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.370> my<00:02:29.299> first

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
nuke I got on this map which was pretty

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
crazy I didn't even notice that i was

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
crazy I didn't even notice that i was
using<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.310> m4a1<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.060> kind<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.480> pick<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
using the m4a1 I kind of just pick a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.160 
using the m4a1 I kind of just pick a
class<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.670> my<00:02:37.670> first<00:02:38.090> nuke<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.420> was<00:02:38.780> using<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
class and my first nuke I was using the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.199 
class and my first nuke I was using the
m4a1<00:02:39.950> with<00:02:40.730> bling<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:43.250> bling<00:02:43.519> would<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
m4a1 with bling the bling would be the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.500 
m4a1 with bling the bling would be the
red<00:02:45.049> dot<00:02:45.230> sight<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.739> silencer<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:47.390> I
