00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
down my car not leaving the body too far

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.550 
down my car not leaving the body too far
forward<00:03:22.239> I'm<00:03:22.450> trying<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> keep<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.049> all<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.350> one

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
forward I'm trying to keep it all in one

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.250 
forward I'm trying to keep it all in one
in<00:03:24.250> one<00:03:24.310> plane<00:03:25.620> I'm<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:26.769> reaching<00:03:27.070> down

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
in one plane I'm just reaching down

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.030 
in one plane I'm just reaching down
nice<00:03:28.980> movie<00:03:29.370> at<00:03:29.640> school<00:03:30.560> k<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.739> with<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
nice movie at school k back with the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.259 
nice movie at school k back with the
weight<00:03:32.189> again<00:03:32.489> we're<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.819> go<00:03:32.939> from<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
weight again we're going to go from the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.420 
weight again we're going to go from the
left<00:03:33.299> hip<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.989> move<00:03:34.200> diagonally<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.159> and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
left hip and move diagonally up and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.339 
left hip and move diagonally up and
around<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.569> we're<00:03:36.689> starting<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.230> incorporate

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
around so we're starting to incorporate

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.100 
around so we're starting to incorporate
that<00:03:37.950> spinal<00:03:38.519> movement<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.510> shoulders<00:03:39.930> as

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
that spinal movement if the shoulders as

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.429 
that spinal movement if the shoulders as
well<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.590> everything<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.099> going<00:03:41.400> nicely<00:03:41.549> one

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
well so everything is going nicely one

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.259 
well so everything is going nicely one
and<00:03:43.439> this<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.860> first<00:03:43.890> movement<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.970> few

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
and this is the first movement of a few

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.410 
and this is the first movement of a few
that<00:03:45.480> are<00:03:45.569> very<00:03:45.750> similar<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.769> really<00:03:47.010> just

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
that are very similar so we really just

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.300 
that are very similar so we really just
continue<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> layer<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.890> Moodle

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
continue to layer on to this this Moodle

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.250 
continue to layer on to this this Moodle
interest<00:03:50.730> rates<00:03:50.970> we're<00:03:51.299> keeping<00:03:52.019> everything

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
interest rates we're keeping everything

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.190 
interest rates we're keeping everything
as<00:03:52.470> simple<00:03:52.709> as<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> suitable<00:03:53.430> still<00:03:53.819> getting

maximum warm up okay let's just pop it
over<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.939> right<00:04:00.120> hand<00:04:00.359> side<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:01.319> I'm<00:04:01.379> going

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
over to the right hand side so I'm going

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.530 
over to the right hand side so I'm going

for my right hip moving up the mound
again<00:04:04.500> I'm<00:04:04.590> pivoting<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.250> class<00:04:05.489> times

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
again I'm pivoting on that class times

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.990 
again I'm pivoting on that class times
as<00:04:06.299> much<00:04:06.510> spinal<00:04:06.989> immobilization<00:04:07.049> as<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:07.980> can

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
as much spinal immobilization as I can

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.310 
as much spinal immobilization as I can
