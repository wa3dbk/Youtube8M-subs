00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.650 
post a link i did a custom on this where
i<00:04:54.660> made<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.169> look<00:04:56.039> completely<00:04:56.580> different<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.330> i

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
i made it look completely different so i

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.900 
i made it look completely different so i
think<00:04:58.530> i<00:04:58.860> might<00:04:59.009> have<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.699> with<00:04:59.880> this

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
think i might have to do that with this

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.730 
think i might have to do that with this
car<00:05:00.300> might<00:05:00.870> be<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:01.050> little<00:05:01.229> harder<00:05:01.590> though

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
car might be a little harder though

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.200 
car might be a little harder though
because<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.820> metal<00:05:03.509> on<00:05:03.630> metal<00:05:03.660> base<00:05:04.139> so

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
because this is a metal on metal base so

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.379 
because this is a metal on metal base so
