yes<00:00:56.300> there's<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.989> new<00:00:57.170> bins<00:00:57.470> of<00:00:57.649> his<00:00:57.829> he's

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
yes there's the new bins of his he's

yes there's the new bins of his he's
only<00:00:58.489> been<00:00:58.670> using<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.559> matter<00:01:00.920> of

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
only been using for what a matter of

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.000 
only been using for what a matter of
three<00:01:02.480> or<00:01:02.600> four<00:01:02.629> weeks<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:03.320> believe<00:01:03.530> they're

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
three or four weeks I believe they're

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.649 
three or four weeks I believe they're
certainly<00:01:04.430> less<00:01:04.640> than<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.850> couple<00:01:05.059> months<00:01:05.300> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
certainly less than a couple months and

tournament like this after not having a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.170 
tournament like this after not having a
lot<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.220> practice<00:01:10.520> whether<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.909> must<00:01:11.060> be

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
lot of practice whether it must be

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.460 
lot of practice whether it must be
terribly<00:01:11.510> difficult
