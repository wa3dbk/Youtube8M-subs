00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone with you maracasi you are watching 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.910
 transfer the best tanks in nominations 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.790
 part 12 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.860
 I'll start with the tank M60 recently as you 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 surely know this tank benefits for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.859
 successful participation on the global map and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.939
 I was personally surprised that m60 is better than 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.710
 pumped tank 48 agent patton 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 attacks played quite a few battles and when 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.590
 started playing on the m60 immediately noticed 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 M60 difference is better not to say that much 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.989
 but still play it a little more pleasant 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.170
 due to the improved accuracy of the instrument and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 so m60 wins premium nomination 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.410
 tank which is better than the original 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 let's see what the M60 is better 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.530
 gun at tanks are the same but at m60 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 better accuracy and 035 instead of 0 36 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.750
 better mixing 18 seconds instead of two 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 seconds and also m60 better 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 reduced ie stabilization me 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.379
 a little better tool in the rest 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.479
 identical someone will say what's the difference 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.840
 insignificant and really but by 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.299
 fact in battle, she feels about 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.439
 wpad speed it is slightly better specific 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.280
 engine power 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 16 97-m 60 16-21 but m60 is better 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.380
 maximum speed of 48 by 3 instead 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.299
 forty five kilometers an hour I consider 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.509
 what's the maximum speed of this case 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.960
 preferably because 45 km per hour 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.350
 maximum speed is too small and the difference 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 at 33 kilometers can be noticeable also 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.640
 in m60 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.939
 slightly better highway agility 52 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
 degrees instead of 50 the tower turns 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.860
 also faster 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.340
 42 degrees instead of 40 on the armor in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.040
 boy armor in the body a little more than 110 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:03.840
 76 millimeters forehead side and 35 from the pocket 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.600
 m60 93 7325 but in battle I donâ€™t think it is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.479
 the difference in armor will often save you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.030
 on the tenth level of both tanks 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.590
 forehead body confidently makes its way with 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.120
 guns 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.519
 9 10 level turret for both tanks 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.160
 armored equally 177 millimeters 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.430
 in the forehead though some claim that 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.830
 M60 is why it is better in the turret 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.920
 the rest of the tanks are almost the same but 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.989
 In general, we change 60 is preferable although 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.239
 getting it difficult further I would like 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.230
 talk about the British Fri-Sau ninth 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.630
 fv 4004 level horse machine with huge 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.760
 bad booking but good 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.819
 dynamics she wins in the nomination 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.329
 the worst disguise among fri sau from 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:58.129
 7 to 9 level worse masking only 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.650
 su-100 y if you don't count it then in fv 4004 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.519
 worst disguise among all fri-sau 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.079
 from first to ninth level 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.120
 slightly better disguise another 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.400
 British Fri-Sau ninth level 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.640
 tortoise certainly not to say that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.069
 fv 4004 has no masking 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.150
 she is much better than the jagdancer 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.130
 e100 masking is about the same as t110 e4 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.799
 if you played on this car you 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.079
 you know therefore on this point you 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.840
 will have to mostly shoot from a distance 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.480
 distance to be off or you may 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.750
 very quickly go into the hangar after all 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.470
 f in the worst margin of safety among all 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.380
 Fri-sa ninth level only 1500 very 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.500
 weak booking 76 millimeters head on 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.680
 shells of 132 millimeters in the forehead of the tower 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.840
 at the same time under a bad inclination well and not 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.370
 you should forget about the huge size of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.599
 this fri sau will not get only blind 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 naturally this car has its own 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.299
 pluses for example towers as well as exact and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.139
 punch and dpm on and gun good 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.200
 dynamics 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.900
 although the maximum speed is small 35 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.870
 kilometers per hour but still it drives 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.049
 the potential is smartly annoying just not 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.630
 the best warrior but generally the car on 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.630
 lover who is sure to enjoy 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.720
 the next tank we have is light tank 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.520
 heavy booking even by name 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.440
 you can understand that this tank is first 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.650
 queue counts for its speed and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.460
 strong armor and really armor ltb 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.280
 quite good when the light tank is 90 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.280
 millimeters forehead towers and 90 meters forehead 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.290
 enclosures and this with outstanding speakers 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.320
 thirty horsepower per ton and 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.610
 maximum speed of 68 kilometers in 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.139
 hour 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.300
 wins ltb in the nomination 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.880
 armored light tank here first 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.760
 level seven slightly less armor in 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.389
 the body has a developed panther 85 millimeters 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.510
 under a good slope then goes t-54 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:09.360
 lightened from him 80 millimeters but u 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.900
 it has a strong tower of 160 millimeters 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.840
 holds and for hitting lttb if it shoots not 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.600
 very dangerous opponent then yes for example i 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.440
 he saw a couple of times how ltb not punch 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.590
 tanks of 7 8 level of course it happens 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.840
 rarely and count on armor on this 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.349
 the car is definitely not worth it but overall armor 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.810
 when you are very strong at the tank 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.650
 high-quality penetration gun 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.889
 accurate alpha quite good 180 tank pretty 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.560
 fun to play it fun and perky and 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.590
 so and on this I have all my friends thanks 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.260
