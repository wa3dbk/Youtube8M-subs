00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
collection not much more to say about

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.879 
collection not much more to say about
him<00:04:02.489> here's<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.549> decent<00:04:03.909> figure<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.959> although

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
him here's a decent figure and although

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.920 
him here's a decent figure and although
as<00:04:06.159> I<00:04:06.250> said<00:04:06.459> he<00:04:06.579> is<00:04:06.609> kind<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.030> expensive<00:04:07.389> for<00:04:07.659> a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
as I said he is kind of expensive for a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.390 
as I said he is kind of expensive for a
figure<00:04:08.139> of<00:04:08.229> this<00:04:08.319> size<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:08.919> it's<00:04:09.069> up<00:04:09.159> to<00:04:09.310> you
