00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.820
 I'm here with lg flex which is one of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
 releases of lg aquino lg digital 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.040
 experience 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.379
 the model will hit the market 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.359
 with a common price and the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 more top-of-the-line appliances will be 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.050
 sold for two thousand seven hundred reais 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
 and of course the most important feature 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 it's from here and has its format 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.390
 curved footprint really a little 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.070
 who is not accustomed to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 pick up the beaten appliances but the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 curvature that are part of a 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.629
 advantage here to make if this gesture 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 here in that curvature that is easier 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.290
 arrive with the colleague up there and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 This is important because we are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 here with 6 inch screen device 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 ie it is a screen size that is not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 everyone can handle it well 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.670
 a hand that have a bit of an advantage over 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 have a long text and such but it is not that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 It's not so easy to handle it with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 only one hand is the signal that is 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 helping enough and do this video 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.539
 took off the alarm system here and so on. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.949
 To finish this video I have 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.010
 opportunity to connect cables 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.689
 micro-usb work home though but 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.430
 in addition to these specifications that I 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220
 I said he has here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 that design we already saw there g 2 with 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 a button on the back 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.150
 by the way the camera is over here 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.939
 3 megapixels but we have a front of 2 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.390
 megapixels and line atom processor is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.290
 a quad core snapdragon 802 points 26 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.220
 ghz memory of 32 gb the internal peace and 2 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.840
 gb of ram 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.970
 anything he did not face 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.920
 the front line with others was the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 resolution of the screen to be output 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 limitation of curvature here is a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 screen and tst only achievements only 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.110
 hd it 's a shame and we got there 6 inches 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600
 of screen who knows a resolution full hd 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.850
 still work 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.009
 the most interesting being his 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.409
 members that image sector 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.930
 fortunÃ© Kuron use a term that perhaps the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.090
 we like them more and curve 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.850
 independent not that I put the image 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.360
