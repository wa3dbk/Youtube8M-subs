this<00:00:16.860> is<00:00:17.010> our<00:00:17.189> action<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> wings<00:00:18.360> maneuver

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
this is our action of wings maneuver

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.750 
this is our action of wings maneuver
test<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.950> going<00:00:20.040> to<00:00:20.130> start<00:00:20.310> down<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.160 
original lane to mix miss the Mack truck
and<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.480> into<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> 12-foot<00:00:40.710> exit<00:00:41.160> lane<00:00:42.170> we

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and then into the 12-foot exit lane we

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.960 
and then into the 12-foot exit lane we
do<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.830> keep<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.550> faster<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
do this we keep on going faster and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.490 
do this we keep on going faster and
faster<00:00:45.060> and<00:00:45.390> faster<00:00:45.540> until<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.020> can't<00:00:46.320> get

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
faster and faster until we can't get

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.400 
faster and faster until we can't get
through<00:00:46.530> without<00:00:47.220> locking<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:47.760> cones<00:00:47.970> over

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.960 

and<00:00:52.410> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.950> you<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.490> maximum

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
and that's what you see is the maximum

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.180 
and that's what you see is the maximum
speed<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.540> avoidance<00:00:54.960> maneuver<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:56.040> also

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
speed to the avoidance maneuver we also

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040 
speed to the avoidance maneuver we also
look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.550> driver<00:00:56.790> confidence<00:00:57.360> how<00:00:57.570> easy<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
look at driver confidence how easy is it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.960 
look at driver confidence how easy is it
for<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.410> driver<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.250> control<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.790> vehicle

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
for that driver to control the vehicle

be testing this year will be having

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.020 
be testing this year will be having

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
something like this setup when we do our

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.050 
something like this setup when we do our
tire<00:01:43.450> test<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.960> made<00:01:44.170> there's<00:01:44.800> someone<00:01:45.490> it's

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
test of how well tires grip how well is

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.249 
test of how well tires grip how well is
the<00:01:51.910> entire<00:01:52.770> vehicle<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:54.430> how<00:01:55.119> easy<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.110> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the entire vehicle is how easy is it to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.230 
the entire vehicle is how easy is it to
maintain<00:01:56.560> control<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.610> if<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.850> can<00:01:58.030> lose

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
maintain control and if you can lose

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:12.600 
maintain control and if you can lose
control<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.930> how<00:01:59.830> easily<00:02:00.220> get<00:02:00.580> back

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.030 

I<00:02:12.730> equate<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.110> roads<00:02:14.350> been<00:02:14.560> plowed<00:02:14.830> but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I equate it to the roads been plowed but

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.530 
I equate it to the roads been plowed but
they're<00:02:15.220> still<00:02:15.310> packed<00:02:15.670> snow<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.300> side

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
they're still packed snow on one side

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
they're still packed snow on one side
and<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.320> middle<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.620> not<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.220> you've<00:02:18.370> got

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and the middle is not so you've got

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.610 
and the middle is not so you've got
really<00:02:19.180> different<00:02:19.480> grip<00:02:19.810> coefficients<00:02:20.500> let

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
really different grip coefficients let

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710 
really different grip coefficients let
you<00:02:20.740> decide<00:02:20.980> when<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.000> run<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.330> test<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.690> have

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
you decide when we run the test we have

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.450 
you decide when we run the test we have
the<00:02:22.930> optical<00:02:23.350> fifth<00:02:23.560> wheel<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.010> car<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
the optical fifth wheel in the car so

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.400 
the optical fifth wheel in the car so
we're<00:02:24.580> measuring<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.150> distance<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:26.050> takes<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
we're measuring the distance it takes to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
right also we're looking at

right also we're looking at

controllability with ABS this car I will

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:54.810 
controllability with ABS this car I will
lock<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.490> one<00:02:42.670> side<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.520> when<00:02:54.520> we're<00:02:54.670> doing

any<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.180> these<00:02:55.300> tests<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:55.870> want<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.110> level

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
any of these tests we want a level

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.530 
any of these tests we want a level
playing<00:02:56.709> field<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.280> every<00:02:57.700> single<00:02:58.060> car<00:02:58.300> gets

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540

the<00:02:58.690> same<00:02:58.870> test<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.860> used<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.100> use<00:03:00.280> an<00:03:00.640> off-road

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
the same test we used to use an off-road

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.130 
the same test we used to use an off-road
circuit<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.450> goes<00:03:01.600> through<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.870> woods

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.060 
circuit that goes through the woods
there<00:03:02.730> these<00:03:03.730> what<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.660> found<00:03:04.840> was<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.920> a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
there these what we found was it's a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.040 
there these what we found was it's a
subjective<00:03:06.310> evaluation<00:03:07.270> we<00:03:07.570> use<00:03:07.750> five

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
subjective evaluation we use five

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.780 
subjective evaluation we use five
different<00:03:08.440> engineers<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> evaluation

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
different engineers for the evaluation

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.540 
different engineers for the evaluation
so<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:11.170> not<00:03:11.290> getting<00:03:11.950> somebody's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
so you're not getting somebody's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.400 
so you're not getting somebody's
personal<00:03:12.910> opinion<00:03:13.239> whether<00:03:13.390> they<00:03:13.630> were<00:03:13.690> good

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
personal opinion whether they were good

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.940 
personal opinion whether they were good
off-road<00:03:14.650> driver<00:03:15.040> or<00:03:15.220> poor<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> track

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
off-road driver or poor that the track

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.340 
off-road driver or poor that the track
was<00:03:18.160> changing<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.880> much<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.420> one<00:03:20.019> person

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
was changing so much that one person

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.110 
was changing so much that one person
will<00:03:20.470> say<00:03:20.590> oh<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.040> brilliant<00:03:21.220> because<00:03:21.910> he

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
will say oh this is brilliant because he

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.699 
will say oh this is brilliant because he

engineer he was route 25 and the track
it<00:03:28.900> completely<00:03:29.320> changed<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.890> was<00:03:30.040> crap<00:03:30.430> you
