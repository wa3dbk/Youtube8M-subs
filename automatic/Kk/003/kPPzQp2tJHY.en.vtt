00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.309
 welcome to the press conference before and at the cup match 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.440
 quarterfinals 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.249
 on Wednesday at the MSV you in the beautiful 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.780
 schauinsland-travel 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.780
 recall 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.099
 for these games we have 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.529
 since the ticket sale started on Wednesday right after the final whistle 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.489
 NATO sold so far in 2006 count with about 2000, according to Rahn 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.669
 to get through in Brig 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.870
 the Duisburgers 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.400
 expect about 20 witnesses to look around we will see what in the end 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.440
 it comes around 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.769
 the referee for the 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.749
 around Vailati on Wednesday the rally is through his third game he 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.200
 whistled at the together on tactics can win 3 1 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.450
 maybe a bad omen 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.710
 also the following home game 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.090
 against the first FSV Mainz 05 so far we have sold many 4 000 tickets 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.660
 from Mainz the news reaches us that they are not their complete concept 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.360
 Continent sold to Mainz sends us a thousand Roma tickets back 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.640
 especially to send us more tickets back over a thousand dollars 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.470
 from that 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.560
 are in areas that we can still safely sell 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 so that 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.070
 sound out in the morning »says today in the East Stand with the tickets to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.380
 to be available 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.140
 and then the away game in Hoffenheim 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.190
 all of our complete continue quota deduct that amounts to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.680
 look at 2921 tickets 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.110
 who so everything 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.670
 there will be on the spot 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.000
 Pauli the day before yesterday in Munich 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 English weeks the coach has said that it is a very unfamiliar light 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 the Bonner Verein 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.109
 of course this week the Bayern 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.889
 is still in the bone or is that actually Schönleber know which 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.290
 To train players for less 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.140
 I see this as positive because in the end hot water is sporty 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.210
 reasonably successful then this song may only have something 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.270
 these English weeks 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 10, the leader of the game should be happy to play and that's enough time 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.440
 Finale dfb-cup you do not have that often 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.460
 and that's why we look forward to it as the percent Sun sing left what 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.760
 do you believe what women Linnemann strength and the first leg and on Wednesday and me 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.959
 expected me 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.349
 took in the lap 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.290
 not just the second division team and for that matter 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.859
 their goal in mind as we do 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.889
 In addition, there is the home game so now took percent already very difficult 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:22.959
 Game for us 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.889
 but I believe that we are around 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.719
 can set cool on the track and only let percent on his acting 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.929
 Clearly the next round was about to be done by the five boys 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:33.749
 we can 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.899
 may be from the faithful reader as it would be Basel ots still come from 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.559
 no mast 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.999
 All that can come that can be made to break through this 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.859
 Coaching us nothing but great and distant to wander the 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.089
 that's the beating 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.149
 because we have to focus on ourselves and 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.769
 if that does not work if you do not exist there 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.699
 what about that anyway 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.159
 now must 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.350
 so two of the time 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.129
 now wants the coach 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.590
 Wednesday in Duisburg 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.249
 Second division is invested 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.249
 I immediately said to overseas for the small program 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.499
 basically percent i already believe that there 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.370
 a difference must be made of the quality sacrifice he must make his 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.679
 Game No, a party 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:22.259
 Kliert from Osloß deny located qualitatively 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.399
 certainly very strong second division team maybe only yes 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.399
 Format so we play very good round 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.929
 March in the apron 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.139
 so be we 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.569
 Erstliga format must show Vienna to come to the semi-finals that's close 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.819
 Huge chance for both teams and accordingly 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.529
 he was judge open around as Ines Andersch morning really around 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.459
 to achieve these goals has the IW 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 Pauli players will not be able to call back more on Wednesday 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.949
 Ke um 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.980
 Otherwise long-term injured will provide all we have 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.079
 Comparisons to the squad 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.659
 in Munich painted students 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.049
 otherwise everyone in the squad is fit sun 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.180
 except for minor injuries to operational and 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.349
 highly motivated 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.819
 is not very close in less than eleven players is very huge around 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.819
 We always said that the competition 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.300
 this allows for a very large percentage of success in the near future 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.499
 certain spotlight yes yes ACS as an association for us it is important in the 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.039
 sports 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.860
 "We really have the chance to reach the bottom of the last four 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.879
 in Germany that's percent super yes there 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.150
 Siemers OPhone proudly wore 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.569
 and I carry Laurich 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:49.529
 Yes 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.729
 he has the same same concentration the same government too 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.550
 the same joy 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.509
 happy around 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.830
 Doing a good job and doing that together 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.259
 and the work 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.380
 that's the big goal Lord this next step and that was natural 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.539
 already try 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.990
 Come on 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.110
 that's a big job to do as well as tasks and percentages 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.000
 As I said we have the goal well works March was one in the next 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Go step 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.500
 Mr. Stegner still a bit question mark with Ballack "still cook 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.309
 past 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.279
 I always assume that water is the players annoyed for us 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.079
 I think it's nice 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.110
 are very strong on the physique 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.449
 Unna 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.889
 in so far nine previously closed it is already played so it will 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.639
 it will be my difficult task too 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.330
 The client is self-confidence 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.410
 and just want to get to our performance limit then you can 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.430
 Listening quality through lockouts 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.949
 definitely bring to bear 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.740
 to let that work around 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.330
 it is difficult 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.080
 Year everything is open 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.169
 Winehouse becomes history but we do not want to hide it but 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.090
 Clearly the goal is of course by Mika Untersee requirements percent 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.450
 eight sessions 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.580
 the semifinals
