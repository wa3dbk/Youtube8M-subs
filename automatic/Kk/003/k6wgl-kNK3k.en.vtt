first and then out to get to the other

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.460 
first and then out to get to the other
corners<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.250> best<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> turn<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> paper<00:01:30.470> like

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
corners it's best to turn the paper like

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.450 
corners it's best to turn the paper like
this<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.329> easy<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.650> control<00:01:34.979> paper

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this and then it's easy to control paper

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.890 
this and then it's easy to control paper
and<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.210> doing<00:01:38.659> that's<00:01:39.659> the

teller or hoodie capture that begins
with<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.670> way<00:02:00.890> okay<00:02:01.890> our<00:02:02.430> four<00:02:02.850> corners<00:02:03.329> are

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
with this way okay our four corners are

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
with this way okay our four corners are
there<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> center<00:02:04.439> try<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> paper<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
there at the center try the paper so it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.080 
there at the center try the paper so it
looks<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.509> diamond

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
looks like a diamond

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.389 
looks like a diamond
once<00:02:07.210> again<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.960> we're<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> blintz

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
once again and we're going to blintz

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.520 
once again and we're going to blintz
fold<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:10.000> second<00:02:10.959> time<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.040> these<00:02:12.220> new<00:02:12.489> corners

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
fold a second time so these new corners

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
fold a second time so these new corners
get<00:02:14.530> folded<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> center<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:19.769> two<00:02:20.769> three

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.280 

and<00:02:30.299> four<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:34.269> this<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.450> called<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.900> double

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and four so this is called the double

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.110 
and four so this is called the double
blintz<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.129> I've<00:02:36.280> done<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.610> twice<00:02:36.879> now

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.729 

turn<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.299> paper<00:02:40.510> over<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.290> other<00:02:41.410> side

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
turn the paper over to the other side

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.120 
turn the paper over to the other side
and<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.200> see<00:02:44.230> where<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> creases

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and there you can see where the creases

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.890 
and there you can see where the creases
cross<00:02:45.430> we're<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> blend<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.599> third

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
cross we're going to blend the third

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.729 
cross we're going to blend the third
time<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.519> last<00:02:48.700> time<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> promise

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
time and this is the last time I promise

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.920 
time and this is the last time I promise
bottom<00:02:50.739> corner<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.370> center<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.510> paper<00:02:52.780> is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
bottom corner to the center the paper is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.220 
bottom corner to the center the paper is
getting<00:02:53.260> thick<00:02:53.530> now<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.730> after<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.690> press

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
getting thick now so after you press

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.589 
getting thick now so after you press
with<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.470> finger<00:02:57.209> scrape<00:02:58.209> with<00:02:58.450> your

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
with your finger scrape with your

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.780 
with your finger scrape with your
thumbnail<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.379> flatten<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.980> fold<00:03:00.220> very<00:03:00.519> well

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
thumbnail to flatten the fold very well

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.289 
thumbnail to flatten the fold very well
I<00:03:01.090> call<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> origami<00:03:02.319> rule<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.799> thumb

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
I call this the origami rule of thumb

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.949 
I call this the origami rule of thumb
and<00:03:06.209> each<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.540> other<00:03:07.660> corners<00:03:09.599> get<00:03:10.599> folded

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
and each of the other corners get folded

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:22.589 
and each of the other corners get folded
the<00:03:11.319> same<00:03:11.590> way<00:03:19.470> yeah<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.180> did<00:03:22.329> three

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
the same way yeah so we did three

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.900 
the same way yeah so we did three
blintzes<00:03:23.109> two<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.590> front<00:03:23.859> one<00:03:24.639> on<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
blintzes two on the front one on the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.140 
blintzes two on the front one on the
back<00:03:26.040> we're<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.190> turn<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.639> four

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
back we're going to turn this four

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
back we're going to turn this four
pointed<00:03:28.690> square<00:03:29.049> shape<00:03:29.380> into<00:03:29.859> an

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
pointed square shape into an

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.879 
pointed square shape into an
eight-pointed<00:03:30.609> star<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.410> those<00:03:32.410> other<00:03:32.650> four

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
eight-pointed star and those other four

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.500 
eight-pointed star and those other four
points<00:03:33.400> are<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.760> come<00:03:33.940> from<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.299> very

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
points are going to come from the very

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.780 
points are going to come from the very
center<00:03:34.989> here<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:36.459> take<00:03:37.359> top<00:03:37.750> point<00:03:38.260> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
center here like this take top point and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.460 
center here like this take top point and
fold<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.000> away<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.599> so<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.200> shows

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
fold it away from you so that it shows

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.879 
fold it away from you so that it shows
above<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:43.180> top<00:03:43.450> edge<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> square<00:03:44.230> about

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
above the top edge of the square about

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.259 
above the top edge of the square about
that<00:03:45.160> much<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.579> fine<00:03:47.040> turn<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> paper<00:03:48.430> you

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that much is fine turn the paper you

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.509 
that much is fine turn the paper you
have<00:03:49.389> a<00:03:49.450> brand<00:03:49.750> new<00:03:50.019> corner<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:51.010> fold<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:51.489> like

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
have a brand new corner to fold up like

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:02.129 
have a brand new corner to fold up like
that<00:03:56.519> two<00:03:57.519> more<00:03:57.700> times<00:04:00.540> try<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.599> make<00:04:01.840> them<00:04:02.019> as

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
that two more times try to make them as

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.470 
that two more times try to make them as
evenly<00:04:02.829> spaced<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.030> shape<00:04:04.419> as<00:04:04.630> possible

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
evenly spaced and shape as possible

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.360 
evenly spaced and shape as possible
here's<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.630> last<00:04:07.780> one

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.820 

there<00:04:11.370> there's<00:04:12.000> our<00:04:12.299> simple<00:04:13.200> eight<00:04:13.409> pointed

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
there there's our simple eight pointed

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.360 
there there's our simple eight pointed
star<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.540> bottom<00:04:15.959> side<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
star this is the bottom side of the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.050 
star this is the bottom side of the
water<00:04:17.579> lily<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:19.049> have<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.320> turn<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.680> over

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
water lily so we have to turn it over

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.960 
water lily so we have to turn it over
right<00:04:21.060> side<00:04:21.359> up<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.830> look<00:04:23.010> there<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.550> center

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
right side up and look there the center

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.670 
right side up and look there the center
you<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.120> see<00:04:25.070> four<00:04:26.070> little<00:04:26.310> corners<00:04:27.530> turn<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
you can see four little corners turn the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.810 
you can see four little corners turn the
paper<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.729> push<00:04:30.060> each<00:04:30.300> corner

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
paper so that you can push each corner

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.409 
paper so that you can push each corner
out<00:04:32.820> from<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.389> center<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:35.280> it'll<00:04:36.270> go

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
out from the center like this it'll go

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.840 
out from the center like this it'll go
all<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> way<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.260> top<00:04:37.460> turn<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.639> paper

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
all the way to the top turn the paper

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.780 
all the way to the top turn the paper
again<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.440> can<00:04:40.560> push<00:04:40.830> out<00:04:41.040> from<00:04:41.669> the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
again so that you can push out from the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:51.950 
again so that you can push out from the
center<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.630> top<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:50.060> another<00:04:51.060> time<00:04:51.510> this

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
center to the top and another time this

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.719 
center to the top and another time this
is<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.199> fourth<00:04:52.500> walk<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:53.160> layer<00:04:53.430> and

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
is the fourth walk for that layer and

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.390 
is the fourth walk for that layer and
look<00:04:54.330> what<00:04:54.449> we've<00:04:54.600> uncovered<00:04:55.340> for<00:04:56.340> more

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
look what we've uncovered for more

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.980 
look what we've uncovered for more
corners<00:04:58.820> turn<00:04:59.820> the<00:04:59.970> paper<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.660> those

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
corners turn the paper so that those

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.080 
corners turn the paper so that those
corners<00:05:01.560> could<00:05:01.770> be<00:05:01.860> pushed<00:05:02.160> away<00:05:02.490> from<00:05:02.970> you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
corners could be pushed away from you

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.500 
corners could be pushed away from you
like<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.979> corner<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.120> can<00:05:06.270> see

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
like this the corner that you can see

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.400 
like this the corner that you can see
here<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.199> going<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.620> go<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.430> far<00:05:09.410> like

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
here is going to go just that far like

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.950 
here is going to go just that far like
this<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.979> if<00:05:11.970> you're<00:05:12.120> using<00:05:12.300> paper<00:05:12.690> that's

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
this and if you're using paper that's

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.510 
this and if you're using paper that's
colored<00:05:13.289> differently<00:05:13.470> on<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.099> other<00:05:14.220> side

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
colored differently on the other side

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.020 
colored differently on the other side
you'll<00:05:15.479> start<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.840> see<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.320> other<00:05:16.349> color<00:05:17.030> so

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
you'll start to see that other color so

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.779
