00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
m.i.a well it can be quite simple we

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.360 
m.i.a well it can be quite simple we
really<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.050> both<00:01:37.380> Sora<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.860> Riku<00:01:38.190> will

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370

so honestly the first arc of Kingdom
Hearts<00:01:42.360> 3<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.960> about<00:01:43.320> restoring<00:01:43.890> those

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
