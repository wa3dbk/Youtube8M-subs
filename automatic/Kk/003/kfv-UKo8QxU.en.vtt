00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.249 
lose you don't lose the medal victory
point<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.869> doesn't<00:01:53.140> matter<00:01:53.290> how<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.410> say<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:53.820> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
point it doesn't matter how I say it so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.920 
point it doesn't matter how I say it so
with<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.410> in<00:01:56.590> mind<00:01:57.360> people<00:01:58.360> who<00:01:58.570> have<00:01:58.720> ice

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
with that in mind people who have ice

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.690 
with that in mind people who have ice
there's<00:01:59.710> two<00:01:59.890> reason<00:02:00.130> why<00:02:00.220> people<00:02:00.369> have<00:02:00.520> ice

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
there's two reason why people have ice

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.150 
there's two reason why people have ice
one<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.539> keep<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.840> resources<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:03.039> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
one is to keep the resources to is the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.270 
one is to keep the resources to is the
pushing<00:02:03.490> metals<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.100> keep

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
pushing metals and if you do it to keep

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.300 
pushing metals and if you do it to keep
your<00:02:09.459> resources<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.209> can<00:02:10.270> understand<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
your resources I can understand like

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220 
your resources I can understand like

nice kind of put plays into that because

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.110 
nice kind of put plays into that because
you've<00:05:47.070> you<00:05:47.190> for<00:05:47.340> really<00:05:47.550> strong<00:05:47.700> defense

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120

whenever<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:48.900> do<00:05:49.050> attack<00:05:49.320> you're<00:05:49.470> gonna<00:05:49.590> be

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
whenever you do attack you're gonna be

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.200 
whenever you do attack you're gonna be
rising<00:05:49.920> in<00:05:50.190> victory<00:05:50.460> points<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.000> then<00:05:51.090> it's

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
rising in victory points and then it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.720 
rising in victory points and then it's
gonna<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:51.530> I'm<00:05:52.530> already<00:05:52.890> talking<00:05:53.310> more<00:05:53.610> both

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
gonna be I'm already talking more both

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
gonna be I'm already talking more both
the<00:05:53.820> next<00:05:54.000> video<00:05:54.180> but<00:05:54.240> yeah<00:05:54.360> it's<00:05:54.480> gonna<00:05:54.570> be

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
the next video but yeah it's gonna be

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.500 
the next video but yeah it's gonna be
harder<00:05:55.290> attacks<00:05:55.970> it's<00:05:56.970> harder<00:05:57.240> for<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.420> to

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
harder attacks it's harder for you to

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.050 
harder attacks it's harder for you to
put<00:05:57.810> your<00:05:57.900> map<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.110> stuff<00:05:58.410> like<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.740> so

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
put your map and stuff like that so

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.080 
put your map and stuff like that so
overall<00:06:00.810> long<00:06:01.410> story<00:06:01.680> short<00:06:01.920> wait<00:06:02.700> till<00:06:02.940> they

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
overall long story short wait till they

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.310 
overall long story short wait till they
came<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.480> get<00:06:03.600> ice

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
came to get ice

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.500 
came to get ice
that's<00:06:04.830> just<00:06:05.070> my<00:06:05.190> recommendation<00:06:05.370> I<00:06:06.120> have<00:06:06.150> ice

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
that's just my recommendation I have ice

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.120 
that's just my recommendation I have ice
right<00:06:06.750> now<00:06:06.810> but<00:06:07.230> that's<00:06:07.380> because<00:06:07.590> I'm<00:06:08.040> going

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
right now but that's because I'm going

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.280 
right now but that's because I'm going
to<00:06:08.190> be<00:06:08.280> doing<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.520> big<00:06:08.700> push<00:06:08.940> my<00:06:09.780> big<00:06:09.960> push<00:06:10.140> is

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
to be doing a big push my big push is

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.780 
to be doing a big push my big push is
done<00:06:10.470> I'm<00:06:10.620> actually<00:06:10.740> probably<00:06:11.190> gonna<00:06:11.460> get<00:06:11.610> rid

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
done I'm actually probably gonna get rid

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.890 
done I'm actually probably gonna get rid
of<00:06:11.820> them<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.210> we'll<00:06:12.330> be<00:06:12.450> carrying<00:06:12.750> both

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
of them so we'll be carrying both

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.900 
of them so we'll be carrying both
victory<00:06:13.200> points<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.590> much<00:06:13.800> it's<00:06:14.760> just

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
victory points that much it's just

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
cooler for me to be able to do strong

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.770
