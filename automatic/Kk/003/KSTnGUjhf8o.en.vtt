00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.129 
know when the battery pack is charged
because<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.459> read<00:02:45.700> those<00:02:46.690> two<00:02:46.930> packs

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
because it will read those two packs

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.240 
because it will read those two packs
combined<00:02:47.530> together<00:02:47.709> will<00:02:48.069> read

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
combined together will read

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220 
combined together will read
approximately<00:02:49.000> twenty<00:02:49.359> two<00:02:49.569> point<00:02:49.900> four

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
approximately twenty two point four

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.020 
approximately twenty two point four
volts<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:50.829> they're<00:02:51.010> fully<00:02:51.250> charged<00:02:51.549> if

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
volts when they're fully charged if

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.129 
volts when they're fully charged if
they're<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.329> fully<00:02:52.600> charged<00:02:52.840> you're<00:02:52.959> going

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
they're not fully charged you're going

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.530 
they're not fully charged you're going
to<00:02:53.200> read<00:02:53.350> way<00:02:53.530> below<00:02:53.859> that<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.329> I'm<00:02:55.420> going

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to read way below that so what I'm going

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.879 
to read way below that so what I'm going

to go ahead and rewire it right now to
connect<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> batteries<00:03:14.519> I'm<00:03:15.519> gonna<00:03:15.670> zoom

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
connect to the batteries I'm gonna zoom

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.349 
connect to the batteries I'm gonna zoom
out<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.060> little<00:03:16.120> bit<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:18.609> simply<00:03:18.940> connect<00:03:19.239> the

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
out a little bit you simply connect the

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.099 
out a little bit you simply connect the
positive<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.930> positive<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:22.109> the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
positive to the positive and the

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.890 
positive to the positive and the
negative<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> night<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.840> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
negative to the night and now the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.610 
negative to the night and now the
batteries<00:03:29.440> are<00:03:29.650> charging

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.870 

and<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.740> I<00:03:35.950> said<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.430> would<00:03:36.550> leave<00:03:36.700> them

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and as I said you would leave them

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.570 
and as I said you would leave them
connected<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.540> configuration<00:03:38.580> until

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
connected in this configuration until

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.350 
connected in this configuration until
they<00:03:39.730> are<00:03:39.880> fully<00:03:40.120> charged<00:03:40.800> which<00:03:41.800> could<00:03:42.010> take

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
they are fully charged which could take

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.450 
they are fully charged which could take
many<00:03:43.360> many<00:03:43.540> hours<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.650> zoom<00:03:47.920> back<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.190> you
