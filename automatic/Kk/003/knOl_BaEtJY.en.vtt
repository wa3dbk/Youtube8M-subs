00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
is straight up and down
more<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.730> does<00:00:23.910> take<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.689> know

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
more so if it does take you in you know

more so if it does take you in you know
still<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> few<00:00:25.410> inches<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
still a few inches but it's going to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
still a few inches but it's going to
have<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.359> less<00:00:27.689> dramatic<00:00:27.900> curve<00:00:28.529> than<00:00:28.920> our

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
have a much less dramatic curve than our

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.950 
have a much less dramatic curve than our
level<00:00:29.670> 2<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:30.029> level<00:00:30.060> 3<00:00:30.630> corsets<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.679> um<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
level 2 or level 3 corsets here um so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.889 
level 2 or level 3 corsets here um so
first<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.680> would<00:00:35.420> see<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.780> was

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
first off how you would see if it was

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
first off how you would see if it was
straight<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.280> by

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
straight up and down or not is by

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
straight up and down or not is by
pulling<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.110> under<00:00:40.350> bust<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> hip

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pulling out the under bust in the hip

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
pulling out the under bust in the hip
area<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.390> much<00:00:42.600> room

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
area this is going to see how much room

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
area this is going to see how much room
does<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.920> gives<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.879> hips

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
does that this gives you for your hips

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
does that this gives you for your hips
and<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.629> under<00:00:45.840> bust<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.559> fill

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and your under bust to actually fill

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
and your under bust to actually fill
this<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:47.039> cinching<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> middle<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this out cinching in the middle as you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.180 
this out cinching in the middle as you
can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> isn't<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> give<00:00:49.980> very

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can see this isn't going to give very

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.389 
can see this isn't going to give very
much<00:00:51.140> level<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.260> isn't<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.620> comfortable<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
much level one isn't that comfortable on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
much level one isn't that comfortable on
me<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:54.120> suggest<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.780> somebody<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
me I would suggest it for somebody that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.270 
me I would suggest it for somebody that
is<00:00:56.420> smaller<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> lot<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> curve<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is smaller with not a lot of curve to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
is smaller with not a lot of curve to
them<00:00:59.399> already<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> starting

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
them already this would be a starting

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
them already this would be a starting
corset<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.550> training<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.930> actually

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
corset for training you could actually

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890 
corset for training you could actually
move<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.189> levels<00:01:05.369> later<00:01:06.299> down<00:01:06.630> when

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
move to different levels later down when

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
move to different levels later down when
your<00:01:07.020> body<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.560> takes<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> curve

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your body actually takes more of a curve

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
your body actually takes more of a curve
to<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.600> comfortable

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to it it's going to be more comfortable

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
to it it's going to be more comfortable
