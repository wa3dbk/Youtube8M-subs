the<00:00:49.800> chipboard<00:00:50.100> rather<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:53.719> have<00:00:54.719> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the chipboard rather and I have this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
the chipboard rather and I have this
lost-and-found<00:00:55.879> collection<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.300> mind's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
lost-and-found collection by my mind's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.680 
lost-and-found collection by my mind's
eye<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.649> called<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> blush<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
eye and it's called the blush and I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.790 
eye and it's called the blush and I
thought<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> colors<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.410> would<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
thought the colors in here would be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.039 
thought the colors in here would be
perfect<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.939> for<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> stamp<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:07.280> used<00:01:09.049> this

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
perfect and so for the stamp I used this

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.460 
perfect and so for the stamp I used this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
