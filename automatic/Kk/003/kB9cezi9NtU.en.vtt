hey gang front McCarl 92 years so it's
Monday<00:00:03.389> October<00:00:03.689> 28th<00:00:04.940> this<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:06.600> is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
Monday October 28th this video here is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
Monday October 28th this video here is
for<00:00:07.290> VW<00:00:07.919> Darren<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.429> how<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> hook<00:00:08.790> up<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.090> Ford

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
for VW Darren and how to hook up a Ford

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:26.550 
for VW Darren and how to hook up a Ford
starter<00:00:09.840> solenoid<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.530> your<00:00:10.650> Volkswagen

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.750 

okay<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:27.620> either<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.190> is<00:00:28.250> going<00:00:28.520> to<00:00:28.580> make

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
okay so either this is going to make

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.510 
okay so either this is going to make
this<00:00:29.240> totally<00:00:29.810> confusing<00:00:30.410> or<00:00:30.590> very

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
this totally confusing or very

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.040 
this totally confusing or very
understandable<00:00:33.280> without<00:00:34.480> much<00:00:35.480> notice<00:00:35.510> I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
understandable without much notice I

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.640 
understandable without much notice I
kind<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:36.920> just<00:00:37.130> threw<00:00:37.340> this<00:00:37.460> together<00:00:37.610> here<00:00:38.650> if

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
kind of just threw this together here if

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.799 
kind of just threw this together here if
I<00:00:39.800> had<00:00:39.980> some<00:00:40.309> cables<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.390> stuff<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.690> might

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
I had some cables and stuff it might

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.049 
I had some cables and stuff it might
make<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:41.989> easier<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.590> understand<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:43.220> anyway

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
make it easier to understand but anyway

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.840 
make it easier to understand but anyway
what<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.420> deal<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.720> is<00:00:45.199> that<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:45.890> guess<00:00:46.489> right

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
what the deal is is that I guess right

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.180 
what the deal is is that I guess right
now<00:00:47.030> this<00:00:47.660> would<00:00:47.960> be<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.440> type<00:00:48.739> of<00:00:48.770> starter

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
now this would be the type of starter

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.360 
now this would be the type of starter
solenoid<00:00:49.400> that<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.879> have<00:00:50.150> this<00:00:50.449> is<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> GM<00:00:51.020> type

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
solenoid that you have this is a GM type

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.549 
solenoid that you have this is a GM type
I<00:00:52.370> believe<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.480> Volkswagen<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.320> still

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
I believe that the Volkswagen is still

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.979 
I believe that the Volkswagen is still
the<00:00:54.710> same<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:56.120> would<00:00:56.360> be<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.660> hot<00:00:56.809> lead

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
the same so this would be the hot lead

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.380 
the same so this would be the hot lead
from<00:00:57.260> your<00:00:57.410> battery<00:00:57.769> here<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.879> would<00:00:59.059> be<00:00:59.089> the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
from your battery here this would be the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.649 
from your battery here this would be the
one<00:00:59.570> lead<00:01:00.260> off<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.860> solenoid<00:01:01.400> that<00:01:02.269> actually

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
one lead off the solenoid that actually

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.920 
one lead off the solenoid that actually
goes<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:03.140> windings<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> starter<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
goes to the windings on the starter and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.420 
goes to the windings on the starter and
this<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.200> here<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.740> would<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:06.890> your<00:01:07.159> start

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
this one here it would be your start

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.070 
this one here it would be your start
signal<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.270> actually<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.659> wire<00:01:08.840> that

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
signal so this is actually the wire that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.570 
signal so this is actually the wire that
I<00:01:09.140> guess<00:01:09.440> would<00:01:09.560> come<00:01:09.799> from<00:01:10.010> your<00:01:10.159> ignition

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
I guess would come from your ignition

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.300 
I guess would come from your ignition
switch<00:01:10.790> originally<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.290> what<00:01:12.710> we<00:01:12.950> need<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.190> do

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
switch originally so what we need to do

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.510 
switch originally so what we need to do
first<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.790> all<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.270> remove<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.530> cable<00:01:16.340> that's

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
first of all is remove the cable that's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.810 
first of all is remove the cable that's
on<00:01:16.700> here<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.150> goes<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.330> your<00:01:17.600> battery<00:01:17.810> and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
on here that goes to your battery and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820 
on here that goes to your battery and
put<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.909> aside<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.080> you're<00:01:21.500> going<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.710> need

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
put that aside and you're going to need

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.609 
put that aside and you're going to need
to<00:01:21.979> put<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.220> jumper<00:01:22.700> wire<00:01:23.170> I'd<00:01:24.170> say<00:01:24.380> probably

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
to put a jumper wire I'd say probably

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.600 
to put a jumper wire I'd say probably
heavy<00:01:25.040> gauge<00:01:25.310> like<00:01:25.580> maybe<00:01:25.869> 10<00:01:26.869> or<00:01:26.900> 12<00:01:27.200> gauge

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
heavy gauge like maybe 10 or 12 gauge

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.969 
heavy gauge like maybe 10 or 12 gauge
from<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.510> post<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:30.289> post<00:01:30.590> because

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
from this post to this post because

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.599 
from this post to this post because
these<00:01:31.159> two<00:01:31.340> have<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.609> be<00:01:31.640> together<00:01:32.270> now<00:01:33.609> then

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
these two have to be together now then

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.270 
these two have to be together now then
what<00:01:34.820> you'll<00:01:34.969> do<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:36.350> you'll<00:01:36.799> take<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.009> new

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
what you'll do is you'll take a new

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.420 
what you'll do is you'll take a new
cable<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.680> your<00:01:39.829> Ford<00:01:40.100> starter

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
cable and this is your Ford starter

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.510 
cable and this is your Ford starter
solenoid<00:01:40.640> here<00:01:41.090> you'll<00:01:42.049> take<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.590> cable<00:01:43.250> from

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
solenoid here you'll take a cable from

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.219 
solenoid here you'll take a cable from
here<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:45.590> here<00:01:46.630> or<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.750> one<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.020> doesn't

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
here to here or this one it doesn't

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.660 
here to here or this one it doesn't
really<00:01:48.320> matter<00:01:48.590> because<00:01:48.829> when<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.399> solenoid

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
really matter because when the solenoid

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.649 
really matter because when the solenoid
closes<00:01:50.210> they<00:01:50.359> just<00:01:50.600> join<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:52.789> like<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.600> said

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
closes they just join so like I said

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.620 
closes they just join so like I said
from<00:01:53.929> here<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.259> here<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.179> then<00:01:56.179> you're<00:01:56.539> gonna

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
from here to here and then you're gonna

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.749 
from here to here and then you're gonna
take<00:01:56.840> another<00:01:56.990> big<00:01:57.350> cable<00:01:57.829> that's<00:01:58.310> gonna<00:01:58.460> go

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
take another big cable that's gonna go

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.010 
take another big cable that's gonna go
from<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.539> other<00:01:59.630> side<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.950> your<00:02:01.039> battery<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
from the other side to your battery the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.749 
from the other side to your battery the
original<00:02:03.469> wire<00:02:03.679> that<00:02:03.979> came<00:02:04.219> from<00:02:04.490> your

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
original wire that came from your

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.290 
original wire that came from your
ignition<00:02:05.299> switch<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:06.649> used<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:07.009> go<00:02:07.159> here<00:02:07.579> is

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
ignition switch that used to go here is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.969 
ignition switch that used to go here is
now<00:02:08.539> going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.960> here<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.440> marked<00:02:09.800> s

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
now going to go to here it's marked s

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.320 
now going to go to here it's marked s
for<00:02:10.310> start<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:13.490> course<00:02:13.760> your<00:02:13.940> key<00:02:14.090> switch

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
for start and of course your key switch

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.990 
for start and of course your key switch
here<00:02:14.690> would<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.860> already<00:02:16.400> getting<00:02:16.700> power<00:02:16.880> from

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
here would be already getting power from

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570 
here would be already getting power from
here<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:18.200> kind<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.770> made<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.100> little<00:02:19.340> diagram

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
here I kind of made this little diagram

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.750 
here I kind of made this little diagram
I<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.240> probably<00:02:20.450> neaten<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:20.990> up<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.230> little<00:02:21.410> bit

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I can probably neaten it up a little bit

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.240 
I can probably neaten it up a little bit
and<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.120> scan<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.200> send<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.860> Andrea

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
and I can scan it and send it to Andrea

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.270 
and I can scan it and send it to Andrea
so<00:02:26.140> hopefully<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.290> makes<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> little

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so hopefully that makes it a little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360 
so hopefully that makes it a little
easier<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.819> understand<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> basically<00:02:31.160> what's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
easier to understand so basically what's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.950 
easier to understand so basically what's
going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.520> happen<00:02:31.880> now<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.060> when<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.510> turn<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
going to happen now is when you turn the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.460 
going to happen now is when you turn the
key<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.170> or<00:02:33.950> when<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:34.220> turn<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.430> your<00:02:34.580> start

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
key on or when you turn on your start

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
key on or when you turn on your start
you're<00:02:36.470> gonna<00:02:36.590> energize<00:02:36.769> this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you're gonna energize this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.839 
you're gonna energize this
it'll<00:02:39.260> close<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.740> solenoid<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.550> bring<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
it'll close this solenoid and bring the

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.750 
it'll close this solenoid and bring the
power<00:02:41.060> from<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.920> from<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.130> post<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.640> this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
power from here from this post to this

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.000 
power from here from this post to this
post<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:45.020> starter<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.470> your<00:02:45.590> starter<00:02:45.920> will

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
post to the starter in your starter will

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.559 
post to the starter in your starter will
turn<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:48.260> anyway<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:49.030> hope<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.090> helps<00:02:50.450> out

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
turn so anyway I hope that helps out

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.290 
turn so anyway I hope that helps out
Darren<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.780> need<00:02:53.959> anything<00:02:54.200> else<00:02:54.530> just

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
Darren if you need anything else just

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.640 
Darren if you need anything else just
tell<00:02:56.300> me<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.510> I'll<00:02:56.630> give<00:02:56.750> Andrea<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.170> call<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
tell me and I'll give Andrea a call and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.540 
tell me and I'll give Andrea a call and
I'll<00:02:58.640> look<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.910> can<00:02:59.060> walk<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.300> through<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.540> okay

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
I'll look I can walk you through it okay

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.860 
I'll look I can walk you through it okay
so<00:03:01.550> anyhow<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.209> hope<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.860> understandable

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
so anyhow I hope that is understandable

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.570 
so anyhow I hope that is understandable
if<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.019> would<00:03:06.110> make<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.410> easier<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.739> could<00:03:07.190> get

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
if it would make it easier I could get

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.120 
if it would make it easier I could get
some<00:03:07.760> small<00:03:08.000> wires<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:09.650> can<00:03:09.800> do<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.010> by

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
some small wires and we can do it by

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
some small wires and we can do it by
colors<00:03:10.489> he's<00:03:11.420> red<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.780> black<00:03:12.819> anyhow<00:03:13.819> but

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
colors he's red and black anyhow but

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.840 
colors he's red and black anyhow but
that's<00:03:14.690> what<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.730> there's<00:03:16.730> always

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
that's what I got so there's always

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.550 
that's what I got so there's always
thanks<00:03:17.209> for<00:03:17.269> watching<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.780> we'll<00:03:18.319> see<00:03:18.470> you
