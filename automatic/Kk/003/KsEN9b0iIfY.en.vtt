comfortable the the pitch this is called

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.320 
comfortable the the pitch this is called
the<00:01:09.060> pitch<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.260> too<00:01:10.560> high<00:01:10.890> um<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the pitch it's not too high um well you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690

see<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.810> has<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> platform<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.430> only

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
see it has a platform that you only

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450 
see it has a platform that you only
really<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.659> much<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> heel<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> it

really have that much of a heel and it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.999 
really have that much of a heel and it
comes<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.420> slight<00:01:18.869> point<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.470> front<00:01:19.830> which

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
comes to a slight point up front which

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
comes to a slight point up front which
is<00:01:20.130> good<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> wear<00:01:21.390> platforms

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is good because when you wear platforms

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.929 
is good because when you wear platforms
they<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:23.040> clunky<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> end<00:01:23.790> up

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they can be really clunky and you end up

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
they can be really clunky and you end up
walking<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.659> Frankenstein<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
walking like Frankenstein but when it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
walking like Frankenstein but when it
comes<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> point<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.450> helps<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
comes to a point it helps you to have a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.330 
comes to a point it helps you to have a
point<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.750> easily<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
point where you can easily get off the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760 
point where you can easily get off the
ground<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> look<00:01:33.270> elegant<00:01:33.810> while<00:01:34.290> doing<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ground and look elegant while doing it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.460 
ground and look elegant while doing it
they<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:35.820> comfortable<00:01:36.479> there's<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
they are very comfortable there's like

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
they are very comfortable there's like
cushion<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:40.020> would

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
cushion in here and I think they would

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.830 
cushion in here and I think they would
fit<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.740> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> people's<00:01:41.549> feet<00:01:41.939> whether<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
fit a lot of people's feet whether you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
fit a lot of people's feet whether you
have<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> wide<00:01:43.409> foot<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
have a wide foot or not now some of the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.210 
have a wide foot or not now some of the
cons<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:47.159> find<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.600> part

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
cons are that I find that this part

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
cons are that I find that this part
tends<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.210> big<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.960> can't

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
tends to be kind of big and you can't

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.200 
tends to be kind of big and you can't
adjust<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> only<00:01:53.369> contest<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
adjust it you only contest it from the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.950 
adjust it you only contest it from the
top<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.700> tend<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> wear<00:01:57.000> between<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.630> size

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
top so I tend to wear between a size

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.219 
top so I tend to wear between a size
nine<00:01:58.320> nine<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> half<00:01:58.979> us<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.509> UK<00:02:00.930> that

but<00:02:13.120> this<00:02:14.120> part<00:02:14.450> was<00:02:14.690> too<00:02:15.049> loose<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.590> I

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
but this part was too loose and I

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.759 
but this part was too loose and I
thought<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.280> nine<00:02:16.549> fit<00:02:17.030> my<00:02:17.750> toes<00:02:18.140> better<00:02:18.470> and

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
thought the nine fit my toes better and

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.710 
thought the nine fit my toes better and
I<00:02:18.890> thought<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.220> fit<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.220> my<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:23.209> ankle

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I thought it fit the back of my my ankle

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.530 
I thought it fit the back of my my ankle
better<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:25.129> being<00:02:25.430> said<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
better that being said if you have a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.699 
better that being said if you have a
wide<00:02:26.989> ankle<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.269> half<00:02:29.599> side<00:02:29.900> half<00:02:30.440> size

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
wide ankle I think a half side half size

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.069 
wide ankle I think a half side half size
would<00:02:31.069> probably<00:02:31.239> work<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.599> also<00:02:33.250> um<00:02:34.250> if

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
would probably work for you also um if

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.170 
would probably work for you also um if
you<00:02:36.079> are<00:02:36.319> between<00:02:36.470> half<00:02:36.980> sizes<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.670> would<00:02:38.060> say

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
you are between half sizes I would say

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.690 
you are between half sizes I would say
go<00:02:38.360> down<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:38.959> for<00:02:39.140> example<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:40.340> wear

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
go down so for example I can wear

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.369 
go down so for example I can wear
between<00:02:40.940> nine<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.180> nine<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.629> a<00:02:41.659> half<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
between nine and nine and a half the

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.360 
between nine and nine and a half the
nine<00:02:42.620> work<00:02:42.829> better<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.310> me<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.989> are<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.709> 8

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
nine work better for me if you are a 8

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.940 
nine work better for me if you are a 8
between<00:02:46.940> 88<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.690> half<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.560> have<00:02:48.769> a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
between 88 and a half and you have a

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.430 
between 88 and a half and you have a
normal<00:02:49.280> size<00:02:49.670> foot<00:02:50.060> normal<00:02:50.900> size<00:02:51.049> ankle<00:02:51.379> and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
normal size foot normal size ankle and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.890 
normal size foot normal size ankle and
everything<00:02:51.739> else<00:02:51.920> go<00:02:52.430> eight<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.720> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
everything else go eight if you have a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.650 
everything else go eight if you have a
wide<00:02:54.379> foot<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:55.069> wide<00:02:55.459> ankles<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.269> might<00:02:56.480> want

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
wide foot a wide ankles you might want

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.800 
wide foot a wide ankles you might want
to<00:02:56.720> go<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.379> size<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.040> actually<00:02:58.370> are<00:02:59.030> but

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
to go the size that you actually are but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.869 
to go the size that you actually are but
I<00:02:59.840> think<00:02:59.989> these<00:03:00.470> are<00:03:00.530> pretty<00:03:00.950> generous<00:03:01.640> in

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.199 
I think these are pretty generous in
their<00:03:01.940> sizing<00:03:02.750> they're<00:03:03.519> super<00:03:04.519> comfortable<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
their sizing they're super comfortable a
