00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.529
 So we have a Christmas tree pattern 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.920
 here it looks like if horizontal 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.290
 so here it looks upright it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 front side 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.210
 Here is the wrong side of the picture is very 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:29.220
 tight therefore need to knit weaker 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 hinges do not make too tight so 1 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.230
 as always we remove the edge then 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 take and knit 2 together front but when 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.420
 This is not to take off as usual I completely 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.870
 I repeat 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.930
 and remove only the first of these loops 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 lower further knit this here is not about not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.210
 filmed along with the next 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:04.610
 and again we remove only one of the bottom and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:12.860
 so the whole series turns out we are shooting 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.860
 slowly only 1 of 2 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.939
 knit again 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 we remove only 1 of 2 we knit here 2 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.869
 we have knitted loops at the bottom 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.350
 but we remove only one and so on until the end 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350
 row 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 repeat knit not very tight 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.070
 attention last we have before edge 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.640
 there are two loops like this we 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.670
 knit too together 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.550
 remove one and then last again 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.690
 knit like edge it was 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.620
 turn over the front row and for the same 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.030
 principle 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.790
 knit purl row first edge 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.910
 remove the thread now here we will have 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.360
 before work knit 2 purl loops 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.950
 but we shoot down only one on the left 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 knitting needles gave again knit 2 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:33.950
 purl but remove only one two 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:37.740
 purl but remove only one knit 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.650
 loosely otherwise except drawing 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.430
 by itself very dense gives the canvas 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.700
 it will be almost very difficult to remove these 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.670
 eyelets and canvas will be a little bit 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.670
 compressed fold so to speak 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.030
 and so he stayed two again last 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 loops we knit them two together 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.630
 we remove as it was before this one and after 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.190
 This knit one edge and so 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:25.239
 we get this picture 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.750
 he practically does not stretch so he 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.500
 looks vertical so here with 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.500
 seamy side
