but serene outpatient Mickey Mouse and
the<00:00:03.240> cursor<00:00:03.659> key<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.650> interesting<00:00:05.100> enough

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
the cursor key is interesting enough

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.160 
the cursor key is interesting enough
going<00:00:05.430> up<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.790> down<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.180> bottom<00:00:06.359> which<00:00:06.960> I

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
going up and down the bottom which I

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.690 
going up and down the bottom which I
suppose<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.799> not<00:00:07.950> unreasonable<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.519> would

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
suppose is not unreasonable but I would

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.419 
suppose is not unreasonable but I would
have<00:00:08.790> expected<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.510> go<00:00:10.349> up<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> down<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> top

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
have expected to go up and down the top

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.470 
have expected to go up and down the top
because<00:00:11.790> we've<00:00:11.880> got<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> patient<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.389> front

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
because we've got the patient in front

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.020 
because we've got the patient in front
of<00:00:12.690> us<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:12.929> anyway<00:00:13.280> so<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.790> out

there we have to put in the put the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.130 
there we have to put in the put the
problem<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> history<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.090> whatever<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
problem or the history or whatever so we

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.790 
problem or the history or whatever so we
have<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> click<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.800> twice<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:22.260> put<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.590> what

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
have to click on it twice to put in what

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
have to click on it twice to put in what
we're<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.250> complaining<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.789> now

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
we're going to be complaining about now

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.570 
we're going to be complaining about now
I<00:00:24.750> would<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.199> thought<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
I would have thought that if I the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.810 
I would have thought that if I the
patient's<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.180> no<00:00:28.220> complaining<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> cough<00:00:29.609> or

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
patient's are no complaining of cough or

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820 
patient's are no complaining of cough or
whatever<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.779> its<00:00:30.990> predictive<00:00:31.500> text

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
whatever it has its predictive text

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.470 
whatever it has its predictive text
which<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.300> very<00:00:33.540> well<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:35.480> isn't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
which is all very well but it isn't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.020 
which is all very well but it isn't
particularly<00:00:37.290> helpful<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
particularly helpful because you if you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.840 
particularly helpful because you if you
really<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.870> recode<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:41.040> might

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
really want to put in a recode you might

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
really want to put in a recode you might
be<00:00:41.969> better<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.450> identify<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.110> but

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
be better to actually identify it but

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.240 
be better to actually identify it but
anyway<00:00:44.160> let's<00:00:44.370> put<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> blood<00:00:44.910> pressure<00:00:45.030> 120

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
anyway let's put in blood pressure 120

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
anyway let's put in blood pressure 120
hot<00:00:47.250> slap<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.940> 80<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> interesting<00:00:49.920> thing

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
hot slap on 80 and the interesting thing

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
hot slap on 80 and the interesting thing
is<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.399> doesn't<00:00:50.579> understand<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.570> not

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is it doesn't understand that it's not

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
things is if you put in height and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.429 
things is if you put in height and
weight<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.350> calculate<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:36.259> BMI<00:01:37.259> for

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
weight it doesn't calculate the BMI for

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
weight it doesn't calculate the BMI for
you<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.430> another<00:01:38.579> little

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you you have to go into another little

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
you you have to go into another little
template<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.470> data

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
template thing to put in the same data

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.700 
template thing to put in the same data
again<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.549> cut<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.590> blood<00:01:43.590> pressure

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
again to cut to get the blood pressure

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.859 
again to cut to get the blood pressure
now<00:01:44.040> whether<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.640> local<00:01:45.299> configuration

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
now whether that's a local configuration

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
now whether that's a local configuration
to<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> BMI<00:01:46.619> whether<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.430> local

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to get the BMI whether that's a local

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.130 
to get the BMI whether that's a local
configuration<00:01:48.299> problem<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.689> not

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
configuration problem or not

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.649 
configuration problem or not
I<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:51.770> medication<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.310> slow<00:01:53.869> you

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
I don't know medication is so slow you

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.969 
I don't know medication is so slow you
you<00:01:57.659> would<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.899> thought<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.799> were

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you would have thought that if you were

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.910 
you would have thought that if you were
in<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.520> screen<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.240> start<00:02:00.450> typing<00:02:00.920> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in that screen you can start typing and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.170 
in that screen you can start typing and
it<00:02:02.750> would<00:02:03.750> give<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:05.520> would<00:02:05.640> start<00:02:05.909> adding

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
it would give you you would start adding

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.760 
it would give you you would start adding
a<00:02:06.270> drug<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.869> normally<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
a drug because normally that's what more

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
a drug because normally that's what more
one<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.759> no<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> click

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
one do but no you actually have to click

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.090 
one do but no you actually have to click
