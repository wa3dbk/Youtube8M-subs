central<00:00:27.339> space<00:00:27.550> station<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.119> you<00:00:28.419> build

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
central space station and you build

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.419 
central space station and you build
structures<00:00:28.989> by<00:00:29.380> expanding<00:00:29.859> outward<00:00:30.220> from

that starting point that's pretty much

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.920 
that starting point that's pretty much
where<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.010> similarities<00:00:33.610> end<00:00:33.610> though<00:00:34.000> the

where the similarities end though the
way<00:00:35.080> you<00:00:35.140> build<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:35.680> by<00:00:35.830> creating<00:00:36.070> tabs<00:00:36.520> of

each other in different ways it can feel

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.230 
each other in different ways it can feel

of range of your basic laser turrets for
example<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:13.960> you'll<00:01:14.499> need<00:01:14.679> an<00:01:14.829> interceptor

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
example and you'll need an interceptor

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.059 
example and you'll need an interceptor
tower<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.880> count<00:01:16.090> your<00:01:16.210> destroyer<00:01:16.600> attacks
