00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 Yes 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.870
 cliff and I hope you're fine 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.119
 with the weather, the weather is coming 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.369
 will regret the best and very often 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.930
 a question that comes back is going to be 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.880
 to know what form 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.300
 dance to bring out the color of my eyes 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.039
 there are certain concepts at the level 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.260
 complementarity of colors all those 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.600
 which must be taken into account except 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.820
 that for simplicity I picked up 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.470
 quickly the colors that go 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.020
 precisely do the best to the different 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.730
 types on so let's start with the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.920
 blue eyes actually to bring out 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.360
 the blue eyes the book is to use 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.850
 warm tones , such as 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.530
 brass and orange trees almost 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.270
 red its colors really make it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.219
 go get the blue pigmentation of 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.180
 eyes to be careful though not to 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.920
 not put too much 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.629
 because otherwise you will have the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 vampires and that's not the purpose of the thing 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.620
 neither can it be just a pencil 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.260
 copper is slightly red on the line 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.239
 upper lashes in delicacy or that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.030
 can really be more makeup + 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.110
 grows in green eyes with the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 favorite purple 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.709
 you have found your happiness so that 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.229
 can all the time matter who has 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:17.259
 more bluish colors as in the front 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.509
 all this so by going with precisely this 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.670
 your there you're going to go look for the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 green pigment of your eyes in the eyes 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.830
 hazel nut makes it hazel eyes 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.140
 a mixture between a kind of glass is 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.979
 henceforth is a bit like a 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.869
 honey color 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.910
 so if it's the sleep you want 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.190
 bring out worth a single or a simple 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.450
 use bronze tones while 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.319

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.080
 stand out 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.539
 go for tones of tourcoing in 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.800
 the second run you have the embarrassment of 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.760
 choice however what he wants to do 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.100
