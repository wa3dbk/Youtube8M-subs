there right at right on the fringe of 14
or<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:37.539> that's<00:01:40.030> seems<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.149> be<00:01:41.239> pretty<00:01:41.599> normal

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
or so that's seems to be pretty normal

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.400 
or so that's seems to be pretty normal
let's<00:01:43.129> go<00:01:43.399> over<00:01:43.729> here<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.950> switch<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:48.200> all

audio pitch the sensitivity of 99 you
notice<00:02:00.679> there's<00:02:00.860> not<00:02:00.979> really<00:02:01.220> much<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.489> a

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
notice there's not really much of a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.170 
notice there's not really much of a
change<00:02:01.940> there<00:02:02.119> when<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.330> turned<00:02:02.599> it<00:02:02.750> up<00:02:10.180> look

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
change there when I turned it up look

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.710 
change there when I turned it up look
drop<00:02:11.540> my<00:02:11.660> quarter

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.479 

can't<00:02:17.720> hold<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.290> thing<00:02:18.349> they're

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.710 

already<00:02:22.489> fading<00:02:23.120> pretty<00:02:23.330> weak<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.780> 12<00:02:25.659> now<00:02:26.659> you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
already fading pretty weak at 12 now you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.850 
already fading pretty weak at 12 now you
can<00:02:26.930> hear<00:02:27.140> there's<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.379> little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.769> noise

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
can hear there's a little bit of noise

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.570 
can hear there's a little bit of noise
anyway<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.640> there's<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.659> response<00:02:30.110> at<00:02:30.260> 12

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
anyway but there's a response at 12

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.009 
anyway but there's a response at 12
really<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.819> faint

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.740 

it's<00:02:39.019> about<00:02:39.400> dead<00:02:40.400> even<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.819> boost<00:02:41.180> process

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's about dead even with boost process

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.960 
it's about dead even with boost process
I<00:02:41.900> guess<00:02:42.280> right<00:02:43.280> at<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.790> edge<00:02:43.909> of<00:02:44.090> 14<00:02:44.569> inches

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
I guess right at the edge of 14 inches

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.270 
I guess right at the edge of 14 inches
now<00:02:46.970> something<00:02:47.329> I<00:02:47.390> wanted<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> show<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:51.280> watch

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
now something I wanted to show you watch

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.970 
now something I wanted to show you watch
this<00:02:54.010> sensitivity<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:57.799> doing

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
this sensitivity it's like it's doing

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:11.440 
this sensitivity it's like it's doing
nothing<00:02:58.250> right<00:02:58.670> now<00:02:58.780> let's<00:02:59.780> go<00:02:59.900> down<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.079> 50

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
sensitivity 50 to 99 made no change now

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.809

if<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.500> drop<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.920> little<00:03:26.160> bit<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> starts<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
if I drop it a little bit it starts to

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.150 
if I drop it a little bit it starts to
go<00:03:26.940> down<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.450> believe<00:03:28.379> I<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.950> down<00:03:29.129> to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
go down I believe I can get it down to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.140 
go down I believe I can get it down to
zero<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:30.690> all<00:03:30.840> metal<00:03:31.170> sensitivity<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.640> it'll

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
zero on all metal sensitivity and it'll

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.009 
zero on all metal sensitivity and it'll
get<00:03:33.269> me<00:03:33.420> close<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:35.330> four<00:03:36.330> or<00:03:36.420> five<00:03:36.569> inches<00:03:36.959> or

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
get me close to four or five inches or

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.970 
get me close to four or five inches or
so<00:03:37.379> now<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.129> do<00:03:38.989> while<00:03:39.989> I've<00:03:40.140> got<00:03:40.319> this<00:03:40.470> out

to<00:04:29.610> show<00:04:29.789> how<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:31.100> Olmedo<00:04:32.100> seems<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.850> be

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
to show how the Olmedo seems to be

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.500 
to show how the Olmedo seems to be
really<00:04:33.180> really<00:04:33.330> weak<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:34.700> don't<00:04:35.700> know<00:04:35.880> if<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.029 

static<00:04:39.510> whole<00:04:40.080> metal<00:04:40.380> will<00:04:40.530> do<00:04:40.650> anything

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
static whole metal will do anything

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.200 
static whole metal will do anything
different<00:04:42.050> one<00:04:43.050> thing<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:43.349> didn't<00:04:43.620> test<00:04:44.210> is

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
different one thing I didn't test is

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.580 
different one thing I didn't test is
what<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.539> we<00:04:45.630> use<00:04:45.810> one<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.139> new<00:04:46.289> tone

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
what if we use one of the new tone

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.570 
what if we use one of the new tone

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.709 

just<00:05:01.550> curious<00:05:02.000> if<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:02.210> made<00:05:02.449> any<00:05:02.599> difference

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
just curious if it made any difference

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.959 
just curious if it made any difference
since<00:05:03.259> it<00:05:03.379> seems<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.740> give<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.969> strange

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
since it seems to give a strange

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.300 
since it seems to give a strange
pinpoint<00:05:05.509> noise<00:05:08.530> well<00:05:09.530> didn't<00:05:09.979> even<00:05:10.099> like<00:05:10.280> me

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
pinpoint noise well didn't even like me

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:21.119 
pinpoint noise well didn't even like me
sitting<00:05:10.699> next<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.300> now<00:05:17.289> same<00:05:18.289> Friday<00:05:18.770> at<00:05:19.870> 14

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
sitting next to it now same Friday at 14

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.350 
sitting next to it now same Friday at 14
now<00:05:22.129> if<00:05:22.219> I<00:05:22.310> T<00:05:22.960> change<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.110> process<00:05:25.360> you'll

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
now if I T change the process you'll

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.149 
now if I T change the process you'll
notice<00:05:26.719> that<00:05:26.810> there's<00:05:27.050> no<00:05:32.469> oops<00:05:33.469> I<00:05:33.830> didn't

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
notice that there's no oops I didn't

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.839 
notice that there's no oops I didn't
mean<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.370> do<00:05:34.490> that

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:51.480 

it<00:05:40.849> changed<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.210> process<00:05:45.639> to<00:05:46.639> say<00:05:46.879> default

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:06:03.339 

y'all<00:05:52.490> know<00:05:57.699> maxed<00:05:58.699> out<00:06:01.689> about<00:06:02.689> exactly<00:06:03.080> the

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
y'all know maxed out about exactly the

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:12.990 
y'all know maxed out about exactly the
same<00:06:03.560> as<00:06:03.740> boost<00:06:03.979> process<00:06:09.909> really<00:06:10.909> faint<00:06:11.150> at<00:06:11.330> 12

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
same as boost process really faint at 12

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.570 
same as boost process really faint at 12
pretty<00:06:14.000> much<00:06:14.120> fades<00:06:14.479> out<00:06:14.659> right<00:06:14.900> about<00:06:15.050> 14<00:06:15.680> so

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
pretty much fades out right about 14 so

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.860 
pretty much fades out right about 14 so
it's<00:06:16.699> almost<00:06:16.819> like<00:06:17.029> the<00:06:17.150> all-metal<00:06:17.449> doesn't

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
it's almost like the all-metal doesn't

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.659 
it's almost like the all-metal doesn't
have<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:17.990> boost<00:06:18.289> and<00:06:18.469> boost<00:06:18.650> process<00:06:19.190> and<00:06:19.490> maybe

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
have a boost and boost process and maybe

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.980 
have a boost and boost process and maybe
that's<00:06:19.909> the<00:06:20.089> only<00:06:20.120> issue<00:06:20.569> with<00:06:20.930> it

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
that's the only issue with it

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.260 
that's the only issue with it
so<00:06:24.099> in<00:06:26.919> discriminate<00:06:27.919> it's<00:06:28.550> about<00:06:28.849> the<00:06:29.029> same

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
so in discriminate it's about the same

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.079 
so in discriminate it's about the same
as<00:06:29.509> boost<00:06:29.839> process<00:06:30.289> on<00:06:30.979> air<00:06:31.279> tests<00:06:31.610> anyway<00:06:31.819> on

as boost process on air tests anyway on
de<00:06:35.589> all-metal<00:06:36.589> might<00:06:36.860> be<00:06:37.009> you<00:06:37.460> know<00:06:37.580> an<00:06:37.699> inch

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
de all-metal might be you know an inch

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.260 
de all-metal might be you know an inch
and<00:06:38.029> a<00:06:38.060> half<00:06:38.120> longer<00:06:38.509> or<00:06:38.810> so<00:06:39.050> deeper<00:06:39.830> in<00:06:40.819> ground

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
and a half longer or so deeper in ground

and a half longer or so deeper in ground
I<00:06:41.659> don't<00:06:42.050> have<00:06:42.199> I'm<00:06:42.349> at<00:06:42.500> a<00:06:42.529> park<00:06:42.800> right<00:06:42.979> now

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
I don't have I'm at a park right now

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.010 
I don't have I'm at a park right now
work<00:06:43.430> in<00:06:44.089> ground<00:06:44.509> it<00:06:44.750> was<00:06:44.960> a<00:06:45.909> about<00:06:46.909> the<00:06:47.419> same<00:06:47.689> I

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
work in ground it was a about the same I

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.439 
work in ground it was a about the same I
mean<00:06:48.199> a<00:06:48.289> little<00:06:48.409> bit<00:06:48.620> less<00:06:48.830> depth<00:06:49.189> at<00:06:50.000> my<00:06:50.240> house

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
mean a little bit less depth at my house

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.649 
mean a little bit less depth at my house
testing<00:06:51.050> on<00:06:51.279> 7-inch<00:06:52.279> dime<00:06:52.520> an<00:06:52.819> 8<00:06:53.029> inch<00:06:53.210> quarter

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
testing on 7-inch dime an 8 inch quarter

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.119 
testing on 7-inch dime an 8 inch quarter
so<00:06:56.439> so<00:06:57.439> now<00:06:57.620> that<00:06:57.680> I've<00:06:57.860> done<00:06:57.979> a<00:06:58.039> little

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
so so now that I've done a little

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.390 
so so now that I've done a little
further<00:06:58.430> testing<00:06:59.000> it's<00:06:59.150> obviously<00:06:59.659> weaker

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
further testing it's obviously weaker

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.909 
further testing it's obviously weaker
but<00:07:01.400> I<00:07:01.460> think<00:07:01.849> it's<00:07:02.259> just<00:07:03.259> the<00:07:03.409> fact<00:07:03.589> that<00:07:03.710> it's

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
but I think it's just the fact that it's

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.640 
but I think it's just the fact that it's
not<00:07:04.069> boosting<00:07:04.550> maybe<00:07:04.759> I<00:07:05.319> don't<00:07:06.319> know

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
not boosting maybe I don't know

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.870 
not boosting maybe I don't know
definitely<00:07:07.129> something<00:07:07.400> different<00:07:07.870> Thanks
