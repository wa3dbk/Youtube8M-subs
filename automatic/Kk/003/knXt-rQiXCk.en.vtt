tonight<00:00:34.550> shoes<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.330> think<00:00:35.690> he<00:00:35.750> wouldn't<00:00:35.990> be

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.500 
tonight shoes I think he wouldn't be
that<00:00:36.380> he<00:00:36.920> has<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.160> check<00:00:37.340> he<00:00:38.060> also<00:00:38.210> thought

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
that he has to check he also thought

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.840 
that he has to check he also thought
that<00:00:38.570> he<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.110> he<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.350> fit<00:00:39.620> for<00:00:39.650> four<00:00:40.400> she<00:00:40.670> saw

that he that he is fit for four she saw

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.150 
that he that he is fit for four she saw
her<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.600> then<00:00:41.870> because<00:00:42.559> that's<00:00:42.770> why<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.100> were

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
her but then because that's why we were

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.530 
her but then because that's why we were
scheduled<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.670> fight<00:00:43.880> otherwise<00:00:44.270> he<00:00:44.420> would
