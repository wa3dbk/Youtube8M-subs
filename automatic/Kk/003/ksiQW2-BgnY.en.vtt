the<00:01:53.340> eternal<00:01:53.790> circle<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.930> body<00:01:55.770> soul<00:01:56.070> spirit

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the eternal circle and body soul spirit

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.350 
the eternal circle and body soul spirit
triangle

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
triangle

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.620 
triangle
beloved<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.700> Jason's<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.940> kinda<00:02:00.450> that's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
beloved and Jason's just kinda that's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.830 
beloved and Jason's just kinda that's
where<00:02:00.810> he's<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.050> he's<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.290> cool<00:02:01.530> guy<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.770> way

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
where he's at he's a cool guy that way

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.290 
where he's at he's a cool guy that way
you<00:02:03.840> were<00:02:03.930> asking<00:02:04.350> me<00:02:04.380> earlier<00:02:04.470> about<00:02:04.800> pickups

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
you were asking me earlier about pickups

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.389 
you were asking me earlier about pickups
so<00:02:06.300> when<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> nylon<00:02:07.290> string<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:08.039> course

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so when we do a nylon string of course

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.310 
so when we do a nylon string of course
we<00:02:08.670> can't<00:02:08.880> use<00:02:09.060> magnetic<00:02:09.479> pickups<00:02:09.990> because

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
we can't use magnetic pickups because

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.340 
we can't use magnetic pickups because
there's<00:02:10.560> no<00:02:10.679> magnetic<00:02:11.009> strings<00:02:11.490> in<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
there's no magnetic strings in that and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.100 
there's no magnetic strings in that and
so<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:13.950> payaso<00:02:14.670> based<00:02:15.150> we've<00:02:15.870> worked

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so this is all payaso based we've worked

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
so this is all payaso based we've worked
on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> free<00:02:16.650> amps<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.450> expression<00:02:18.450> system

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
on the free amps of expression system

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 
on the free amps of expression system
knob<00:02:19.080> layout<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.860> preamps<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.400> built

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
knob layout the preamps we built

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.150 
knob layout the preamps we built
ourselves<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.810> use<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> paisa<00:02:22.470> sensor<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
ourselves but we use a paisa sensor and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.620 
ourselves but we use a paisa sensor and
works<00:02:23.370> really<00:02:23.670> quite<00:02:23.850> nice<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> as

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
works really quite nice on this as

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.310 
works really quite nice on this as
opposed<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.500> steel<00:02:25.800> strings<00:02:26.130> which<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.490> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
opposed to steel strings which has a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.990 
opposed to steel strings which has a
body<00:02:28.320> sensors<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> kind<00:02:29.910> of

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
body sensors in here and then a kind of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.510 
body sensors in here and then a kind of
a<00:02:30.440> magnetic<00:02:31.440> pickup<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.010> fits<00:02:32.250> under<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
a magnetic pickup that fits under the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.130 
a magnetic pickup that fits under the
sound<00:02:32.820> board<00:02:33.030> but

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
sound board but

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
sound board but
a<00:02:35.230> little<00:02:35.980> Lagrange<00:02:36.370> knowing<00:02:36.819> its<00:02:36.970> background

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
a little Lagrange knowing its background

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.930 
a little Lagrange knowing its background
there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.510 

so<00:02:40.840> anyways<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:43.180> cool<00:02:43.360> guitar
