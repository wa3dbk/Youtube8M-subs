for the duration of this video I'm going
to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.550> using<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.970> skeleton<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.680> zombie

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
to be using the skeleton as the zombie

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.189 
to be using the skeleton as the zombie
is<00:00:23.340> bugged<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> explained<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> past

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
is bugged as I explained in the past

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.880 
is bugged as I explained in the past
video<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.650> skeleton<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:29.300> work<00:00:30.890> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
video but the skeleton will work so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
video but the skeleton will work so
first<00:00:32.219> off<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.969> there's<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.300> armor

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
first off you see that there's an armor

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.220 
first off you see that there's an armor
setting<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.920> armor<00:00:35.340> setting<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:36.230> change

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
setting this armor setting can change

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.940 
setting this armor setting can change
whether<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.040> creature<00:00:38.309> has<00:00:38.670> armor<00:00:39.420> equipped

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
whether the creature has armor equipped

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
whether the creature has armor equipped
or<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> ever

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
or not so if you don't want them to ever

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.150 
or not so if you don't want them to ever
have<00:00:45.170> armor<00:00:46.170> equipped<00:00:46.590> essentially<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> can

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
have armor equipped essentially you can

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.500 
have armor equipped essentially you can
just<00:00:47.340> set<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.180> high<00:00:48.329> level

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
just set it to some really high level

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.260 
just set it to some really high level
they're<00:00:48.780> never<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> reach<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.270> they'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
they're never going to reach and they'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.549 
they're never going to reach and they'll
always<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.170> normal<00:00:52.680> equipment<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
always just have normal equipment or in

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.330 
always just have normal equipment or in
skeletons<00:00:55.559> case<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
skeletons case is just going to have a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.959 
skeletons case is just going to have a
bow<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.520> 0<00:00:56.730> armour<00:00:58.100> however<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.489> set<00:00:59.850> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
bow and 0 armour however you can set it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
bow and 0 armour however you can set it
to<00:01:00.000> where<00:01:00.359> every<00:01:00.750> creature<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.199> diamond

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to where every creature has diamond

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
to where every creature has diamond
armor<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.309> skeletons<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.239> zombies<00:01:03.300> every

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
armor or skeletons and zombies every

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.539 
armor or skeletons and zombies every
creature<00:01:04.170> doesn't<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.769> access<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.280> armor

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
creature doesn't have access to armor

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
creature doesn't have access to armor
justice<00:01:06.000> skeletons<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> zombies<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
justice skeletons and zombies so if I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.670 
justice skeletons and zombies so if I
change<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.659> values<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> skeleton

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
change these values on the skeleton

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
change these values on the skeleton
standing<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> level<00:01:14.130> 12<00:01:14.430> area<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
standing in the level 12 area so if I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.539 
standing in the level 12 area so if I
reload<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> server<00:01:18.080> spawn<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> skeleton<00:01:19.650> has

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
reload the server spawn a skeleton has

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
reload the server spawn a skeleton has
diamond<00:01:20.909> armor<00:01:21.259> I'll<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.710> set<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
diamond armor I'll go ahead and set this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
diamond armor I'll go ahead and set this
back<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> actually

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
back so you can see that that actually

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.069 
back so you can see that that actually
works<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:28.549> Spock<00:01:29.549> Skelton<00:01:30.000> perfectly<00:01:30.930> fine

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
works and Spock Skelton perfectly fine

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.179 
works and Spock Skelton perfectly fine
so<00:01:31.850> that's<00:01:32.850> basically<00:01:32.970> how<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> works<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
so that's basically how that works the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.480 
so that's basically how that works the
armor<00:01:35.880> sets<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.590> override<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> previous

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
armor sets do override the previous

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.230 
armor sets do override the previous
armor<00:01:39.240> sets<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.409> example<00:01:40.439> chainmail

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
armor sets so for example chainmail

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
armor sets so for example chainmail
overrides<00:01:42.240> leather<00:01:42.649> gold<00:01:43.649> overrides<00:01:44.220> chain

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
overrides leather gold overrides chain

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.569 
overrides leather gold overrides chain
mail<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> leather<00:01:45.320> iron<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.770> rides<00:01:47.100> gold

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
mail and leather iron over rides gold

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.810 
mail and leather iron over rides gold
chain<00:01:48.090> mail<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> leather<00:01:49.220> diamond<00:01:50.220> overrides

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
chain mail and leather diamond overrides

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120 
chain mail and leather diamond overrides
all<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> rest<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.509> course<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> that's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
all the rest of course so that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.789 
all the rest of course so that's
basically<00:01:53.280> how<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> works<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.509> basically<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
basically how it works it's basically I

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.580 
basically how it works it's basically I
said<00:01:56.729> basically<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.180> lot<00:01:57.360> i'm<00:01:57.479> sorry<00:01:57.590> it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
said basically a lot i'm sorry it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.940 
said basically a lot i'm sorry it's
going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> look<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> search<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.619> best

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
going to look and search for the best

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.639 
going to look and search for the best
gear<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.610> possibly<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.960> equip

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
gear you can possibly have and equip

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.850 
gear you can possibly have and equip
that<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> keep<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> even<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.740> have

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that and keep it so even if you have

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.369 
that and keep it so even if you have
chainmail<00:02:08.280> set<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.239> hundred<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> have

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
chainmail set to a hundred and you have

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.130 
chainmail set to a hundred and you have
a<00:02:10.410> level<00:02:11.370> hundred<00:02:11.819> creature

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
a level hundred creature

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.130 
a level hundred creature
it's<00:02:13.380> still<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.520> gold<00:02:14.960> instead<00:02:15.960> of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's still going to use gold instead of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's still going to use gold instead of
chainmail<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:17.010> Gold's<00:02:17.370> better<00:02:18.319> so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
chainmail just because Gold's better so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.490 
chainmail just because Gold's better so
that's<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> armor<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.290> let's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that's all it is for the armor now let's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.100 
that's all it is for the armor now let's
go<00:02:22.620> ahead<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.830> look<00:02:22.950> at<00:02:23.069> health<00:02:23.340> experience

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
go ahead and look at health experience

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.010 
go ahead and look at health experience
damage<00:02:25.110> i'm<00:02:25.860> using<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.459> beta<00:02:26.700> 2.1<00:02:27.420> versions<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
damage i'm using a beta 2.1 versions so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.050 
damage i'm using a beta 2.1 versions so
there's<00:02:28.230> also<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:28.800> two<00:02:29.100> settings<00:02:29.430> i<00:02:29.700> will

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there's also these two settings i will

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020 
there's also these two settings i will
explain<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.590> upcoming<00:02:31.890> update<00:02:32.550> but

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
explain them for the upcoming update but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.620 
explain them for the upcoming update but
for<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.050> these<00:02:34.410> settings<00:02:35.630> so

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
for now you don't have these settings so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.660 
for now you don't have these settings so
going<00:02:36.870> back<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.050> health<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:38.280> essentially

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
going back to health this essentially

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.979 
going back to health this essentially
just<00:02:38.910> changes<00:02:39.209> how<00:02:39.360> much<00:02:39.510> health<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
just changes how much health the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.190 
just changes how much health the
creature<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> normal<00:02:42.090> scale<00:02:42.510> sin<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
creature has so a normal scale sin that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.370 
creature has so a normal scale sin that
is<00:02:43.260> level<00:02:43.650> 12<00:02:43.980> has<00:02:44.970> 24<00:02:45.630> health<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.320> is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
is level 12 has 24 health and that is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.250 
is level 12 has 24 health and that is
calculated<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.340> formula<00:02:48.170> what<00:02:49.170> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
calculated with this formula what it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.630 
calculated with this formula what it
does<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.590> takes<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.070> level<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
does is it takes the level of the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.259 
does is it takes the level of the
creature<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:52.340> puts<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> tag

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
creature and puts that in for the tag

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.870 
creature and puts that in for the tag
level<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.010> here<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.459> 20

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
level so you can see right here is 20

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.810 
level so you can see right here is 20
plus<00:02:57.500> 3<00:02:58.500> plus<00:02:58.820> 1<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.930> that's<00:03:01.519> simply<00:03:02.519> how<00:03:02.550> it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
plus 3 plus 1 so that's simply how it

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
plus 3 plus 1 so that's simply how it
works<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.300> can<00:03:03.390> make<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> flat<00:03:04.080> number

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
works you can make this a flat number

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
works you can make this a flat number
like<00:03:05.810> 2000<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.560> reload<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.130> server<00:03:08.630> and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
like 2000 and if I reload the server and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.430 
like 2000 and if I reload the server and
I<00:03:10.410> spawn<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.800> skeleton<00:03:11.430> down<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:13.019> has<00:03:13.200> two

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I spawn a skeleton down it has two

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.140 
I spawn a skeleton down it has two
thousand<00:03:13.800> health<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.550> basically<00:03:14.820> do

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
thousand health so you can basically do

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.880 
thousand health so you can basically do
whatever<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.510> want<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.290> personally

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
whatever you want with this I personally

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.860 
whatever you want with this I personally
think<00:03:17.370> using<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.790> scaling<00:03:18.239> formula<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.840> this

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
think using a scaling formula like this

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.190 
think using a scaling formula like this
is<00:03:19.260> smarter<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.570> whole<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:21.780> for

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
is smarter and is the whole reason for

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.430 
is smarter and is the whole reason for
leveling<00:03:22.980> mobs<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.900> rather<00:03:25.170> just

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
leveling mobs but if you rather just

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280 
leveling mobs but if you rather just
have<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> flat<00:03:26.040> rate<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
have a flat rate that you can the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.550 
have a flat rate that you can the
experience<00:03:28.769> formula<00:03:29.310> works<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.640> same<00:03:29.670> way

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
experience formula works the same way

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.910 
experience formula works the same way
rainy<00:03:31.560> weather<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.290> experience<00:03:34.620> formula

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
rainy weather the experience formula

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.039 
rainy weather the experience formula
works<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> same<00:03:35.220> way<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.360> explained<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
works the same way as I explained in the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.039 
works the same way as I explained in the
config<00:03:37.350> doubt<00:03:37.530> yml<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:39.000> heroes<00:03:39.630> and

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
config doubt yml the heroes and

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.810 
config doubt yml the heroes and
minecraft<00:03:40.890> experience<00:03:41.400> enchantment<00:03:42.030> gets<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
minecraft experience enchantment gets a

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.330 
minecraft experience enchantment gets a
amount<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:45.030> experience<00:03:45.360> from<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.989> formula

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
amount of experience from this formula

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.979 
amount of experience from this formula
so<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.700> heroes<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.239> here<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.840> see

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so I have heroes on here so you can see

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.319 
so I have heroes on here so you can see
how<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.140> works<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.829> if<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.160> kill<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.640> level<00:03:51.000> 12

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
how it works but if I kill a level 12

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.509 
how it works but if I kill a level 12
creature<00:03:51.600> since<00:03:52.110> it's<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> same<00:03:52.650> formula<00:03:53.489> as

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
creature since it's the same formula as

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.110 
creature since it's the same formula as
a<00:03:53.670> health<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.120> should<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:55.730> 24<00:03:56.730> experience<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:59.670> I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
a health I should get 24 experience so I

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.100 
a health I should get 24 experience so I
butcher<00:04:00.780> these<00:04:00.959> guys<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:02.420> spawn<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> skeleton

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
butcher these guys and spawn a skeleton

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.910 
butcher these guys and spawn a skeleton
and<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.310> kill<00:04:05.579> him<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:06.290> got<00:04:07.290> 24

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
and now if I kill him I got 24

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.430 
and now if I kill him I got 24
experience<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.840> showing<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.230> I'm

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
experience so just showing you that I'm

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.120 
experience so just showing you that I'm
not<00:04:10.560> bluffing<00:04:10.859> on<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.459> actually<00:04:11.880> works

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
not bluffing on this this actually works

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.900 
not bluffing on this this actually works
you<00:04:14.130> wouldn't<00:04:14.400> want<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.579> do<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:14.790> because

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
you wouldn't want to do this because

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.830 
you wouldn't want to do this because
this<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.209> absolutely<00:04:15.840> ridiculous<00:04:16.640> but<00:04:17.840> i'll

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
this is absolutely ridiculous but i'll

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.320 
this is absolutely ridiculous but i'll
go<00:04:19.049> ahead<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.289> reload<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:23.130> if<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:23.940> kill<00:04:24.210> this

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
go ahead and reload and if I kill this

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
go ahead and reload and if I kill this
guy<00:04:24.510> should<00:04:24.720> get<00:04:25.050> 2000

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
guy should get 2000

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.150 
guy should get 2000
for<00:04:26.790> experience<00:04:27.360> yep<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:28.980> that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
for experience yep so just like that

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.070 
for experience yep so just like that
that's<00:04:29.580> how<00:04:29.790> simply<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.570> change<00:04:30.840> that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
that's how simply you can change that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.690 
that's how simply you can change that
and<00:04:32.450> set<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.600> spec<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.340> finally<00:04:35.340> we<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:35.669> the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and set the spec and finally we have the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.200 
and set the spec and finally we have the
damage<00:04:36.330> formula<00:04:37.100> all<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.280> does<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.030> min

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
damage formula all this does is the min

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.000 
damage formula all this does is the min
and<00:04:39.240> max<00:04:39.540> value<00:04:39.900> makes<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.490> range<00:04:41.490> of

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
and max value makes it a range of

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.560 
and max value makes it a range of
numbers<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.460> can<00:04:44.669> possibly<00:04:44.880> have<00:04:45.360> to

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
numbers that you can possibly have to

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.750 
numbers that you can possibly have to
randomize<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.410> essentially<00:04:47.370> making<00:04:47.580> an

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
randomize it and essentially making an

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.720 
randomize it and essentially making an
RPG<00:04:48.210> type<00:04:49.100> type<00:04:50.100> system<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:52.370> with<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.520> right

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
RPG type type system so with this right

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.580 
RPG type type system so with this right
here<00:04:54.060> if<00:04:54.570> you're<00:04:54.720> ever<00:04:54.840> going<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.169> use<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
here if you're ever going to use the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.270 
here if you're ever going to use the
random<00:04:55.950> system<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.520> need<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:56.970> use<00:04:57.330> this

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
random system you need to use this

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.719 
random system you need to use this
specifically<00:05:01.100> what<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:02.280> does<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.700> it

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
specifically what this does is it

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.670 
specifically what this does is it
produces<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.450> random<00:05:03.900> number<00:05:04.139> between<00:05:04.350> your

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
produces a random number between your

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.780 
produces a random number between your
max<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.250> min<00:05:05.400> values<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.370> have<00:05:08.610> to

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
max and min values and it you have to

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.330 
max and min values and it you have to
use<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.180> sin<00:05:09.389> tax<00:05:09.419> or<00:05:09.840> won't<00:05:10.560> really<00:05:10.800> work<00:05:10.889> if

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
use the sin tax or won't really work if

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820 
use the sin tax or won't really work if
you<00:05:11.460> just<00:05:11.729> take<00:05:12.510> out<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.840> min<00:05:13.080> you're

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
you just take out the min you're

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.400 
you just take out the min you're
essentially<00:05:14.400> getting<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:15.150> random<00:05:16.139> number

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
essentially getting a random number

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.879 
essentially getting a random number
between<00:05:16.590> 0<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.490> 4<00:05:17.760> just<00:05:18.389> the<00:05:18.510> way<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.750> works

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
between 0 and 4 just the way it works

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.580 
between 0 and 4 just the way it works
it's<00:05:19.889> because<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:21.120> fam<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.780> formula<00:05:22.200> is<00:05:22.229> sent

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
it's because the fam the formula is sent

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.360 
it's because the fam the formula is sent
through<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.860> Java<00:05:23.430> reader<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:25.440> basically

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
through a Java reader and it basically

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.290 
through a Java reader and it basically
reads<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.800> determines<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:29.100> result<00:05:29.760> with

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
reads it and determines a result with

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.070 
reads it and determines a result with
math<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.760> ahead<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:33.000> set<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.360> spec<00:05:33.660> to

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
math so go ahead and set the spec to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.810 
math so go ahead and set the spec to
make<00:05:34.200> sure<00:05:34.350> it<00:05:34.470> works<00:05:34.710> I'm<00:05:35.400> not<00:05:35.550> going<00:05:35.760> to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
make sure it works I'm not going to

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.890 
make sure it works I'm not going to
really<00:05:35.940> show<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.300> guys<00:05:36.450> that<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.720> works

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
really show you guys that it works

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.529 
really show you guys that it works
because<00:05:37.460> there's<00:05:38.460> not<00:05:38.610> really<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.910> good<00:05:39.210> way<00:05:39.479> to

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
because there's not really a good way to

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.210 
because there's not really a good way to
show<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.260> it's<00:05:40.410> working<00:05:40.560> specifically

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
show you that it's working specifically

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.529 
show you that it's working specifically
but<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.789> can<00:05:42.210> assure<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.900> does<00:05:42.930> work

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
but I can assure you that it does work

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.390 
but I can assure you that it does work
I've<00:05:45.539> tested<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.110> lot<00:05:46.350> myself<00:05:46.590> on<00:05:46.979> my<00:05:47.070> RPG

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
I've tested it a lot myself on my RPG

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.290 
I've tested it a lot myself on my RPG
server<00:05:47.760> elsewhere<00:05:48.479> but<00:05:49.490> you<00:05:50.490> can<00:05:51.060> take<00:05:51.180> my

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
server elsewhere but you can take my

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
server elsewhere but you can take my
word<00:05:51.360> that<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:51.750> works<00:05:51.930> but<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:52.770> can<00:05:52.890> change

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
word that it works but you can change

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.500 
word that it works but you can change
this<00:05:53.310> whatever<00:05:53.700> you<00:05:53.789> want<00:05:54.000> if<00:05:54.120> you<00:05:54.180> wanted<00:05:54.450> to

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
this whatever you want if you wanted to

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.360 
this whatever you want if you wanted to
be<00:05:54.630> really<00:05:54.900> ridiculous<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.740> just<00:05:55.979> kill<00:05:56.190> your

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
be really ridiculous and just kill your

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.200 
be really ridiculous and just kill your
players<00:05:56.669> with<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.060> chance<00:05:57.389> you<00:05:57.930> could<00:05:58.050> do<00:05:58.200> this

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
players with a chance you could do this

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.510 
players with a chance you could do this
but<00:06:00.210> as<00:06:00.419> always<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:01.020> can<00:06:01.050> use<00:06:01.320> level<00:06:01.740> now<00:06:02.490> a

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
but as always you can use level now a

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.460 
but as always you can use level now a
difference<00:06:03.120> between<00:06:03.510> this<00:06:03.720> formula<00:06:04.260> and

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
difference between this formula and

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.790 
difference between this formula and
these<00:06:05.010> formulas<00:06:05.840> with<00:06:06.840> this<00:06:07.020> formula<00:06:07.470> you<00:06:07.770> can

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
these formulas with this formula you can

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.960 
these formulas with this formula you can
use<00:06:08.370> in<00:06:08.580> an<00:06:08.700> event<00:06:09.450> tag<00:06:10.070> now<00:06:11.070> that<00:06:11.430> all<00:06:11.669> this

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
use in an event tag now that all this

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.090 
use in an event tag now that all this
does<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:12.419> grabs<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.870> minecraft<00:06:13.500> event<00:06:13.830> and

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
does it grabs the minecraft event and

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.940 
does it grabs the minecraft event and
gets<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.789> damage<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:15.450> do<00:06:15.840> with<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:16.410> so

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
gets the damage that you do with it so

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.950 
gets the damage that you do with it so
if<00:06:17.280> a<00:06:17.550> arrow<00:06:17.850> hits<00:06:18.150> you<00:06:18.270> it'll<00:06:18.479> just<00:06:18.690> take<00:06:18.810> the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
if a arrow hits you it'll just take the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.360 
if a arrow hits you it'll just take the
arrow<00:06:19.110> damage<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:19.860> put<00:06:20.610> that<00:06:20.760> in<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:20.970> formula

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
arrow damage and put that in the formula

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.730 
arrow damage and put that in the formula
all<00:06:23.370> right<00:06:23.520> and<00:06:23.669> finally<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:24.210> last<00:06:24.240> two

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
all right and finally the last two

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.740 
all right and finally the last two
settings<00:06:25.740> aren't<00:06:26.010> too<00:06:26.280> difficult<00:06:26.820> basically

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
settings aren't too difficult basically

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.360 
settings aren't too difficult basically
what<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.900> does<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.350> just<00:06:28.710> enables<00:06:29.220> or

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
what it does is it just enables or

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.150 
what it does is it just enables or
disables<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:30.120> mob<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.570> have<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:31.680> be<00:06:31.770> put<00:06:32.010> into

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
disables a mob to have to be put into

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.700 
disables a mob to have to be put into
the<00:06:32.340> plug-in<00:06:33.000> so<00:06:33.750> for<00:06:33.930> example<00:06:34.020> if<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:34.530> don't

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
the plug-in so for example if you don't

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.010 
the plug-in so for example if you don't
want<00:06:34.919> bets<00:06:35.220> to<00:06:35.430> have<00:06:35.550> any<00:06:35.700> levels<00:06:36.090> or<00:06:36.300> take<00:06:36.990> up

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
want bets to have any levels or take up

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.899 
want bets to have any levels or take up
any<00:06:37.320> memory<00:06:37.710> you<00:06:38.039> can<00:06:38.190> just<00:06:38.340> set<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.700> false

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
any memory you can just set it to false

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:39.740 
any memory you can just set it to false
and<00:06:39.180> my

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
and my

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.620 
and my
plugin<00:06:39.990> will<00:06:40.170> just<00:06:40.440> completely<00:06:40.560> ignore<00:06:41.160> bats

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
plugin will just completely ignore bats

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.210 
plugin will just completely ignore bats
and<00:06:42.630> you<00:06:42.690> can<00:06:42.810> do<00:06:42.900> that<00:06:43.020> on<00:06:43.080> a<00:06:43.230> per<00:06:43.680> creature

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
and you can do that on a per creature

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.540 
and you can do that on a per creature
type<00:06:45.080> basis<00:06:46.080> so<00:06:46.410> if<00:06:46.530> i<00:06:46.620> wanted<00:06:46.860> chickens<00:06:47.280> to

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
type basis so if i wanted chickens to

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.670 
type basis so if i wanted chickens to
not<00:06:47.700> have<00:06:47.880> it<00:06:47.910> but<00:06:48.510> i<00:06:48.570> want<00:06:48.780> cows<00:06:48.990> to<00:06:49.200> have<00:06:49.350> it<00:06:49.500> i

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
not have it but i want cows to have it i

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.280 
not have it but i want cows to have it i
can<00:06:49.860> set<00:06:50.070> that<00:06:50.360> now<00:06:51.360> if<00:06:51.570> we<00:06:51.720> do<00:06:51.870> have<00:06:52.080> it<00:06:52.200> on

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
can set that now if we do have it on

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.160 
can set that now if we do have it on
true<00:06:52.680> for<00:06:52.890> example<00:06:53.340> we<00:06:54.270> can<00:06:54.570> specifically

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
true for example we can specifically

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.910 
true for example we can specifically
disabled<00:06:55.770> on<00:06:56.840> different<00:06:57.840> worlds<00:06:57.960> so<00:06:58.740> if<00:06:58.830> you

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
disabled on different worlds so if you

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.680 
disabled on different worlds so if you
have<00:06:59.010> a<00:06:59.040> creative<00:06:59.370> world<00:06:59.730> for<00:06:59.970> example<00:07:00.390> and

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
have a creative world for example and

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.530 
have a creative world for example and
it's<00:07:01.290> set<00:07:01.470> to<00:07:01.500> enable<00:07:02.270> chickens<00:07:03.270> will<00:07:03.450> be

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
it's set to enable chickens will be

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.750 
it's set to enable chickens will be
enabled<00:07:03.900> on<00:07:03.960> all<00:07:04.200> other<00:07:04.380> worlds<00:07:04.800> except<00:07:05.520> for

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
enabled on all other worlds except for

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.080 
enabled on all other worlds except for
creative<00:07:07.460> whereas<00:07:08.460> if<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:08.700> said<00:07:08.910> it's<00:07:09.030> a

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
creative whereas if you said it's a

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.170 
creative whereas if you said it's a
false<00:07:09.360> it's<00:07:09.630> disabled<00:07:10.170> on<00:07:10.290> all<00:07:10.470> worlds<00:07:11.100> but<00:07:12.090> if

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
false it's disabled on all worlds but if

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.330 
false it's disabled on all worlds but if
you<00:07:12.270> want<00:07:12.419> to<00:07:12.510> be<00:07:12.750> enabled<00:07:13.680> on<00:07:13.740> all<00:07:13.890> worlds<00:07:14.250> you

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
you want to be enabled on all worlds you

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.880 
you want to be enabled on all worlds you
