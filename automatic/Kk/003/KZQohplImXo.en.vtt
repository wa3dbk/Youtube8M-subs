machine at Caterpillar our designed

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
machine at Caterpillar our designed
philosophy<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> machine<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
philosophy is to make the machine as

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
philosophy is to make the machine as
safe<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.480> possible<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:46.200> servicing<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
safe as possible when servicing and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
safe as possible when servicing and
maintaining<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> machine<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> ways

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
maintaining the machine one of the ways

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
maintaining the machine one of the ways
we<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.379> by<00:00:49.770> moving<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.489> service

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
we do that is by moving those service

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.729 
we do that is by moving those service
points<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> ground<00:00:51.750> levels<00:00:52.140> whenever

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
points to ground levels whenever

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400 
points to ground levels whenever
possible<00:00:53.629> anytime<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.170> have

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
possible anytime that we don't have

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
possible anytime that we don't have
ground-level<00:00:55.800> service<00:00:56.250> points<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.180> sure

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
ground-level service points we make sure

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
ground-level service points we make sure
that<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:57.750> contained<00:00:58.199> within<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.949> guarded

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
