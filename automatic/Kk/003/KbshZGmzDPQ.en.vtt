00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the jitters and the Crouch so that it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.390 
the jitters and the Crouch so that it
just<00:00:42.239> feels<00:00:42.629> both<00:00:43.019> okay<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.890> sorry<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
just feels both okay I'm sorry I'm so

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.060 
just feels both okay I'm sorry I'm so
late<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.269> time<00:00:45.420> fighting<00:00:45.570> pom-poms

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
late I have hard time fighting pom-poms

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.530 
late I have hard time fighting pom-poms
pom-poms<00:00:47.070> yeah<00:00:47.489> pom-poms<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.150> then<00:00:48.269> I<00:00:48.300> found

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
pom-poms yeah pom-poms but then I found

energy<00:00:59.219> drink<00:00:59.399> commercial<00:00:59.520> i<00:00:59.820> thought<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
energy drink commercial i thought you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
energy drink commercial i thought you
know<00:01:00.270> nothing<00:01:00.989> says<00:01:01.170> energy<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
know nothing says energy like a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
know nothing says energy like a
cheerleader<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.449> true<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> wore<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
cheerleader that's true so I wore a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.529 
cheerleader that's true so I wore a
smart<00:01:05.070> power<00:01:05.220> t-shirt<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.940> I<00:01:06.000> put<00:01:06.270> my<00:01:06.300> hair<00:01:06.509> up

just<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:16.140> concentrating<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.039> science

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just I was concentrating on the science

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.889 
just I was concentrating on the science
at<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.729> drink<00:01:17.970> cuz<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> science<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
at the drink cuz it's the science that

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:19.940 
at the drink cuz it's the science that
makes<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.170> different<00:01:19.590> than<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.830> other

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
makes it different than all the other

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
makes it different than all the other
energy<00:01:20.430> drinks<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.240> drinks<00:01:21.479> give<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.690> energy

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
energy drinks the drinks give you energy

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.169 
energy drinks the drinks give you energy
yeah<00:01:22.679> but<00:01:23.039> without<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.429> jitters<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
yeah but without the jitters in the

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.410 
yeah but without the jitters in the
crash<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> science<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
crash and the science is what does that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
crash and the science is what does that
but<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> drinks<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.899> use<00:01:27.990> energy<00:01:28.229> without

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
but the drinks can use energy without

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.130 
but the drinks can use energy without
the<00:01:29.310> jitters<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.849> the<00:01:29.940> crash<00:01:32.240> no<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.569> um<00:01:33.840> but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the jitters in the crash no but um but

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
the jitters in the crash no but um but
they<00:01:34.440> do<00:01:34.500> give<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> lots<00:01:35.039> of<00:01:35.130> energy<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
they do give you lots of energy and so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.540 
they do give you lots of energy and so
pom-poms<00:01:36.599> and<00:01:36.810> cheerleader<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:38.099> it<00:01:38.250> you
