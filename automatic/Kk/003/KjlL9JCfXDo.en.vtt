transmitter<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.120> turned<00:00:09.360> off<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:10.469> let's<00:00:10.710> turn

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
transmitter is turned off now let's turn

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.490 
transmitter is turned off now let's turn
this<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:16.310> there<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.400> go<00:00:18.109> let's<00:00:19.109> check<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
this on and there we go let's check the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.460 
this on and there we go let's check the
servos<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:22.670> there<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.760> go<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.570> trot<00:00:24.869> oh

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.780 

okay<00:00:28.820> so<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.960> simple

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
okay so what we want to do now is simple

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.720 
okay so what we want to do now is simple
we<00:00:32.790> want<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> prove<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.579> depending<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
we want to prove that depending on the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.720 
we want to prove that depending on the
ankle<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> tilt<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.950> receiver<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
ankle or the tilt of the receiver on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.389 
ankle or the tilt of the receiver on the
other<00:00:38.820> copter<00:00:39.329> frame<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> prove

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
other copter frame you want to prove

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
other copter frame you want to prove
that<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.829> affect<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:45.170> angle<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that it's going to affect the angle of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
that it's going to affect the angle of
the<00:00:46.410> swash<00:00:46.680> plate<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.399> essentially<00:00:47.850> will

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the swash plate which essentially will

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.630 
the swash plate which essentially will
cause<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> drifting<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.489> essentially<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
cause a drifting which essentially in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
cause a drifting which essentially in
the<00:00:50.670> opposite<00:00:51.420> direction<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> RX<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the opposite direction that the RX is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880 
the opposite direction that the RX is
tilted<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> RX<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> tilted<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
tilted so if the RX is tilted that the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
tilted so if the RX is tilted that the
receiver<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.340> stilted<00:00:56.640> left<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.719> heavy<00:00:57.930> will

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
receiver is stilted left the heavy will

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.090 
receiver is stilted left the heavy will
drift<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.510> if<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.840> tilted<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
drift right and if it's tilted right the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
drift right and if it's tilted right the
heli<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.550> drift<00:01:02.789> left<00:01:03.059> forward<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.530> heavy

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
heli will drift left forward the heavy

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
heli will drift left forward the heavy
will<00:01:04.979> drift<00:01:05.189> backward<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:07.020> I've

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
will drift backward and so on what I've

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.800 
will drift backward and so on what I've
got<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.680> le<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> foam

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
got on this le now is this kind of foam

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.910 
got on this le now is this kind of foam
right<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.670> sanding<00:01:11.670> block<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.360> simple<00:01:12.990> all

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
right here sanding block very simple all

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
right here sanding block very simple all
right<00:01:14.100> I've<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> foam<00:01:15.180> cut<00:01:15.420> up

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
right I've got some of that foam cut up

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
right I've got some of that foam cut up
and<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> poem<00:01:16.470> i'm<00:01:16.619> using<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.220> about

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and that's the poem i'm using it's about

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
and that's the poem i'm using it's about
three-eighths<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.090> inch<00:01:18.180> deep<00:01:18.479> tick<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
three-eighths of an inch deep tick so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
three-eighths of an inch deep tick so
i've<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> play<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:22.080> move<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
i've got a lot of play here to move that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.300 
i've got a lot of play here to move that
guy<00:01:22.770> round<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.689> demonstrate<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
guy round and demonstrate this to you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
guy round and demonstrate this to you
what<00:01:26.310> i'm<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.119> simple<00:01:27.750> i'm

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
what i'm going to do now simple i'm

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
what i'm going to do now simple i'm
going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> fire<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> shuttle<00:01:29.970> until<00:01:30.810> i<00:01:30.840> get

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
going to fire up the shuttle until i get

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.399 
going to fire up the shuttle until i get
to<00:01:31.729> fast<00:01:32.729> enough<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.659> no<00:01:33.780> vibration

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to fast enough that there's no vibration

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.920 
to fast enough that there's no vibration
and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:34.829> i'm<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.400> pushing<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and then i'm going to be pushing on the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
and then i'm going to be pushing on the
receiver<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.490> need<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.270> look

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
receiver and what you need to do is look

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
receiver and what you need to do is look
at<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> swash<00:01:40.290> plate<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
at the swash plate here and see what it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
at the swash plate here and see what it
does<00:01:42.030> you'll<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.049> compensate

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
does you'll see that it will compensate

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.819 
does you'll see that it will compensate
and<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.610> tilt<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> opposite<00:01:45.659> direction

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
and it will tilt the opposite direction

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.319 
and it will tilt the opposite direction
what<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.040> tells<00:01:47.280> us<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.579> without<00:01:47.939> any

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
what this tells us is without any

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
what this tells us is without any
ambiguity<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.450> receiver<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> tilted

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
ambiguity that if the receiver is tilted

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
ambiguity that if the receiver is tilted
on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> frame<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.270> swashplate<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:55.110> tilt<00:01:55.409> in

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
on the frame the swashplate will tilt in

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.679 
on the frame the swashplate will tilt in
the<00:01:55.770> opposite<00:01:56.280> direction<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.509> you're

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the opposite direction and what you're

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.660 
the opposite direction and what you're
going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> drifting<00:02:00.689> heli<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
going to have is to a drifting heli and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
going to have is to a drifting heli and
while<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.969> people<00:02:03.149> may<00:02:03.390> say<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.140> you'd

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
while some people may say that you'd

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.199 
while some people may say that you'd
need<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:05.399> severe<00:02:06.409> tilt<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.879> RX<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
need a very severe tilt on the RX to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.420 
need a very severe tilt on the RX to
cause<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> bad<00:02:09.989> drift<00:02:10.410> looker<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> would<00:02:11.220> say

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
cause a bad drift looker you would say

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.410 
cause a bad drift looker you would say
like<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.060> call<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> hard<00:02:12.599> left

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
like they call a hard left

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
check out the swashplate go so let's

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.340 
check out the swashplate go so let's
simulate<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:19.020> very<00:03:19.320> smile<00:03:19.800> mild<00:03:21.110> lack<00:03:22.110> of

like<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.760> now<00:03:26.760> watch<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.210> swashplate<00:03:27.510> go

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
like that now watch the swashplate go

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
like that now watch the swashplate go
that's<00:03:29.160> not<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.520> lot<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.270> it's<00:03:30.420> enough<00:03:30.690> to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that's not a lot but it's enough to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.630 
that's not a lot but it's enough to
cause<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> drift<00:03:31.760> plenty<00:03:33.050> cause<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.110> drift<00:03:34.640> so

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
cause a drift plenty cause a drift so

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.760 
cause a drift plenty cause a drift so
there<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> go<00:03:36.210> check<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.810> wash<00:03:37.080> they<00:03:37.350> go<00:03:37.620> as

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
there you go check this wash they go as

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.680 
there you go check this wash they go as
I<00:03:37.920> move<00:03:38.130> this

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.730 

now<00:03:43.260> excuse<00:03:44.130> me<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.610> if<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.110> not<00:03:46.320> enough

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
now excuse me but if this is not enough

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.130 
now excuse me but if this is not enough
to<00:03:46.950> prove<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:48.260> receiver<00:03:49.260> placement<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
to prove that receiver placement is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.440 
to prove that receiver placement is
basically<00:03:52.140> at<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.500> main<00:03:52.710> source<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:54.270> heli

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
basically at the main source of the heli

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.990 
basically at the main source of the heli
drifting<00:03:55.050> when<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.830> receiver<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:56.670> placed

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
to keep the swashplate level this is not

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.320 
to keep the swashplate level this is not
enough<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.230> prove<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.710> but<00:04:05.520> guess<00:04:05.790> what<00:04:06.030> I

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
enough to prove this but guess what I

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.000 
enough to prove this but guess what I
really<00:04:06.840> don't<00:04:06.960> know<00:04:07.230> what's<00:04:07.440> going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.800> prove
