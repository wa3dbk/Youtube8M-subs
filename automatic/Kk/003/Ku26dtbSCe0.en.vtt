00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.010
 I'm going to make amazing cakes and bar 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.680
 for that you need as the cake foil 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.330
 that is here in the dosage and in it 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.460
 do you surprise the ball because it has to go on 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.260
 stiff also in the freezer 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.400
 I also need bar of course 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.250
 amaze 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 I also gault here that is a gel what 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.520
 you can do on top to finish off nicely 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.800
 Close 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.750
 cookie crumbs a little melted butter 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.970
 water the barbarian mix and whipped cream 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.800
 well i'm going to start it is that i am the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.590
 Biscuit crumbs will mix with the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.980
 melted butter and its ratio 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:51.219
 one in 3 is therefore a third 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:57.610
 kill and then the other parts 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.750
 stir the crumbs well until 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.730
 all right 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 has a layer of butter and stuck immediately 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 nice each other so i have here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 my roll of acetate foil this I cut one 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 small piece from 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:34.640
 I do that in the dosage 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:36.140
 so and then the ratio for the bottom 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.360
 that is actually what you enjoy yourself 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 you are really a fan of one 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.289
 cookie base then you can just have a tasty one 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.390
 make thick soil and otherwise you do it 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.149
 somewhat thinner 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.159
 to stamp it on, I have an old one 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.159
 teaspoon was taken the stalk of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.130
 bent then you can easily 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:07.780
 you push the coup crumbs 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:07.780
 in the ring like that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.689
 put this away for a moment then I'll go to the 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.730
 whipping cream also means whipping 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.620
 that he is just about a little fatter than 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 he needs yogurt with your cottage cheese thickness 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.739
 to become 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.810
 would batter other lobbig this will you should 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.810
 still a little fluid 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.860
 the youth of the comes then I am now going to mix 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.860
 create 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.379
 Water had to do immediately stir 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 and then immediately through the whipped cream 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.980
 stir 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.410
 when it remains too long 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.879
 if it becomes thick then it becomes a gel 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.170
 something like 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.560
 and then you get all the lumps in the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.560
 whipped cream 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.510
 mix this well 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.819
 grootel just there 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.590
 as you stir this well then you put 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.590
 put it in the fridge for 5 minutes 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.069
 how can it be a little fly up 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.930
 and then I put it in a piping bag and then 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.930
 I'm going to fill my cake with you 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.780
 so that's ready 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.190
 then I am going to spray it in the maud and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.250
 for that I use a path to the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.470
 spray limp and to fill as usual 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.990
 always extra hand 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.910
 a measuring cup because this is still a bit 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.250
 liquid 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.070
 the creator becomes a bit awkward 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.639
 the sump here so very easy 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.639
 let it slide 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.720
 well that's enough 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.820
 tip of spraying cut 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.270
 and then you fill up the thing 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.449
 yes you can fill it as high as you 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.880
 likes it yourself but keep it in mind 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.070
 note that there is another 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.039
 jello layer comes on top so don't 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:28.199
 it not this not the for this goes now 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.639
 just the freezer in about an hour 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.110
 one is your good heart and then you can indirectly 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.110
 do a nice john layer over it 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.440
 so sweet i have frozen here in one 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.300
 Piping bag already done a little colcci 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.160
 I give it a color that I like 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.480
 find matching with the hazelnut 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.520
 I also heated it a bit in the 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.200
 microwave and it spreads 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.200
 easier about frozen pie 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.370
 so what i am doing now is a very thin layer 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.840
 spray on it and briefly with it 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.120
 piping bag with the tip 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.830
 just smearing a little bit is the point 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.830
 that it only has a very small mirror 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.860
 at 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.480
 Hey 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.110
 it's hope 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.630
 of course now very carefully the ring 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.960
 off and then see where does it start from 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.960
 the foil 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.670
 so now you can do it that i haven't 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.110
 because he is frozen now 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.480
 defrost in the fridge later 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.900
 takes about an hour and then one 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.900
 eat well
