really liked there wasn't a lot of
fine-tuning<00:01:12.299> once<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.619> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
fine-tuning once you get one set it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.719 
fine-tuning once you get one set it's
pretty<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:15.020> right<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:16.710> done<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.100> an

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
hour putting a hole the hole header

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
hour putting a hole the hole header
together<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.750> said<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
together and it's like you said a little

while ago to snap one and offices it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
while ago to snap one and offices it's
so<00:01:25.259> much<00:01:25.439> easier<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.740> looking<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.369> ranch

the furled and they laid on top of each
other<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.959> had<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> cut<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.770> one<00:02:21.010> way<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:23.500> lift

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
other we had to cut it one way to lift

other we had to cut it one way to lift
it<00:02:23.950> at<00:02:24.820> all<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.450> only<00:02:25.600> get<00:02:25.780> about<00:02:25.840> 20%<00:02:26.830> of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
it at all and we only get about 20% of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.940 
it at all and we only get about 20% of
the<00:02:27.040> crop<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.570> then<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:28.959> tried<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.739> Gator

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the crop and then we tried the Gator

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.650 
the crop and then we tried the Gator
mince<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.880> ones<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.510> went

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
mince the little ones and then we went

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
mince the little ones and then we went
to<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.959> big<00:02:32.110> ones<00:02:32.380> we<00:02:33.370> still<00:02:33.670> couldn't<00:02:33.910> get

very<00:02:34.150> much<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.840> crop<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.040> then<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:38.380> called

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
very much of the crop and then we called

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.760 
very much of the crop and then we called

up of course when we were going the way

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.770 
up of course when we were going the way
that<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.310> fell<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.820> lifted<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.330> much<00:02:58.540> better

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
that it fell it lifted it much better

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.520

than going away from it but we did

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.009 
than going away from it but we did
recover<00:03:03.480> probably<00:03:04.480> 80%<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.380> our<00:03:05.500> crop<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
the Flexi fingers to show us how they

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.140 
the Flexi fingers to show us how they
work<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:23.730> had<00:03:23.849> tried<00:03:25.640> cutting<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.910> one

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
work we had tried cutting it in one

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.979 
work we had tried cutting it in one
direction

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
direction

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.780 
direction
we<00:03:28.230> tried<00:03:28.470> cutting<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.920> crossways<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
we tried cutting it crossways in the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.970 
we tried cutting it crossways in the
rows<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.900> tried

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
rows we tried

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.380 
rows we tried
like<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.819> said<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.180> Gator<00:03:33.390> mends<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:35.390> both

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
like I said the Gator mends and the both

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.270 
like I said the Gator mends and the both
styles<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.110> game<00:03:37.290> Herman's<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.920> big<00:03:38.099> one

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
styles of the game Herman's the big one

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.380 
styles of the game Herman's the big one
in<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.459> little<00:03:38.670> one<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.000> we<00:03:39.599> basically<00:03:41.390> were

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
in the little one and we basically were

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.259 
in the little one and we basically were
able<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> come<00:03:43.140> back<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.709> re<00:03:44.069> re<00:03:44.700> sweep<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
able to come back and re re sweep the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.039 
able to come back and re re sweep the
field<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> Flexi<00:03:47.250> finger<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.450> probably

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
field with the Flexi finger and probably

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.729 
field with the Flexi finger and probably
picked<00:03:49.290> up<00:03:49.440> 40<00:03:50.010> 60<00:03:50.220> bushels<00:03:50.610> or<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:51.870> we<00:03:52.170> by

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
picked up 40 60 bushels or if we by

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.180 
picked up 40 60 bushels or if we by
doing<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.360> re<00:03:54.599> swept<00:03:55.079> most<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:56.069> the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
doing that so we re swept most of the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.350 
doing that so we re swept most of the
fields<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.849> think<00:03:57.390> we<00:03:57.780> had<00:03:57.930> about<00:03:58.700> about<00:03:59.700> 1100

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
fields I think we had about about 1100

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.750 
fields I think we had about about 1100
acres<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:01.019> we<00:04:01.650> had<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.920> go<00:04:02.069> back<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.519> Reese

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
acres that we had to go back and Reese

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.680 
acres that we had to go back and Reese
wheat<00:04:03.000> when<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.840> say<00:04:04.049> 60<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> 40<00:04:04.860> bushels

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
wheat when I say 60 to 40 bushels

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.690 
wheat when I say 60 to 40 bushels
you<00:04:06.690> know<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.900> wheat<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.560> making<00:04:08.010> should

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you know the wheat was making should

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.740 
you know the wheat was making should
have<00:04:08.819> made<00:04:09.530> 120<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:10.680> more<00:04:10.709> bushels

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
have made 120 or more bushels

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.860 
have made 120 or more bushels
but<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:13.709> had<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.099> much<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.670> was<00:04:15.060> below

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
but we had so much of it that was below

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.129 
but we had so much of it that was below
the<00:04:15.900> top<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> furrow<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.989> the

the top of the furrow and down in the
