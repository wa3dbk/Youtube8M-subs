episode<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.570> geometry<00:00:10.170> we're<00:00:10.650> gonna<00:00:10.800> learn

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
episode of geometry we're gonna learn

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.499 
episode of geometry we're gonna learn
about<00:00:11.309> some<00:00:11.550> fun<00:00:11.730> activities<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.389> can

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
about some fun activities that you can

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.709 
about some fun activities that you can
do<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.809> triangles<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> when<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.299> first

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
do with triangles so when I first

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.630 
do with triangles so when I first
thought<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.139> triangle<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.920> thought<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
thought of a triangle I thought of a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.750 
thought of a triangle I thought of a
piece<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.850> pizza<00:00:20.210> here's<00:00:21.210> my<00:00:21.420> piece<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.840> pizza

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
piece of pizza here's my piece of pizza

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.250 
piece of pizza here's my piece of pizza
and<00:00:23.760> maybe<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.289> pepperoni<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
and maybe it's got some pepperoni on it

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.370 
and maybe it's got some pepperoni on it
so<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.289> look<00:00:31.289> at

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
so what you can do with that is look at

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.360 
so what you can do with that is look at
it<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> calculate<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.460> surface<00:00:32.700> area<00:00:34.370> now

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it to calculate the surface area now

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.090 
it to calculate the surface area now
let's<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.899> want<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.829> bit

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
let's say you want to get a little bit

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
let's say you want to get a little bit
more<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> depth<00:00:39.050> let's<00:00:40.050> take<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> piece<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
more in depth let's take that piece of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
more in depth let's take that piece of
pizza<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.489> turn<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.969> into<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> piece<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> cake

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
pizza and turn it into a piece of cake

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.670 
pizza and turn it into a piece of cake
now<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> 3d<00:00:48.360> object<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
now you have a 3d object so you can

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.760 
now you have a 3d object so you can
calculate<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:51.090> volume<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:54.410> know<00:00:55.410> these

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
calculate the volume of it I know these

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
calculate the volume of it I know these
activities<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.430> food<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> triangles<00:00:57.149> are

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
activities with food and triangles are

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
activities with food and triangles are
really<00:00:57.570> fun<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> probably<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> keep

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
really fun so you probably want to keep

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.420 
really fun so you probably want to keep
going<00:00:59.280> home<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.770> fun<00:01:02.010> activities

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
going home so some more fun activities

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
going home so some more fun activities
that<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.000> triangles<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.979> to<00:01:04.979> go

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that you can do with triangles are to go

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.899 
that you can do with triangles are to go
through<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.060> magazine<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.250> find<00:01:08.250> triangles

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
through a magazine and find triangles

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.100 
through a magazine and find triangles
there<00:01:09.920> find<00:01:10.920> those<00:01:11.130> triangles<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> circle

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
there find those triangles and circle

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.149 
there find those triangles and circle
them<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> guess<00:01:14.180> triangulate<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
them or I guess triangulate them and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
them or I guess triangulate them and
then<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> triangles<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.630> used

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
then you can see the triangles are used

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
then you can see the triangles are used
in<00:01:18.960> everyday<00:01:19.320> life<00:01:20.299> next<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.650> your

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
in everyday life next you can take your

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.090 
in everyday life next you can take your
triangles<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> cut<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.979> cut<00:01:25.979> out

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
triangles and cut some out cut out

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
triangles and cut some out cut out
triangles<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> piece<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> paper<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
triangles from a piece of paper or a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.890 
triangles from a piece of paper or a
piece<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.650> cardboard<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
piece of cardboard and then see what you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.249 
piece of cardboard and then see what you
can<00:01:31.079> fit<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.960> fit<00:01:34.140> them

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
can fit them with now you can fit them

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050 
can fit them with now you can fit them
probably<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> piece<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> pizza<00:01:35.640> or

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
probably with a piece of pizza or

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.380 
probably with a piece of pizza or
something<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.170> door<00:01:37.409> wedge<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:39.030> rooftop

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
something like a door wedge or a rooftop

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.039 
something like a door wedge or a rooftop
or<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:41.340> don't<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> come<00:01:42.930> up
