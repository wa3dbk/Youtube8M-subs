00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
less toughness because i don't have the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.380 
less toughness because i don't have the
dodge<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> cold<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:59.149> i'm<00:01:00.149> not

a billion damage just fucker would stop

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:51.880

so<00:02:07.540> keep<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.900> mind<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.290> greater<00:02:08.680> if<00:02:08.920> 50<00:02:10.260> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so keep in mind this is greater if 50 it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.350 
so keep in mind this is greater if 50 it
should<00:02:11.560> let<00:02:11.740> me<00:02:11.770> do<00:02:11.950> 51<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.760> won't<00:02:13.000> I'm<00:02:13.240> not

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
should let me do 51 but I won't I'm not

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.410 
should let me do 51 but I won't I'm not
sure<00:02:13.570> what's<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.390> I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
sure what's going on with that so I

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.270 
sure what's going on with that so I
guess<00:02:16.540> after<00:02:16.900> we'll<00:02:17.410> see<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:17.740> it's<00:02:17.920> actually

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
guess after we'll see if it's actually

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.400 
guess after we'll see if it's actually
glitched<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.240> what<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> blue<00:02:26.140> elites

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
glitched or what I like the blue elites
