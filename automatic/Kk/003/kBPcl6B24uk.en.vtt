to be able to touch you now we think

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
to be able to touch you now we think
about<00:01:28.439> some<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> other<00:01:28.920> features<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.460> we

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
about some of the other features if we

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
about some of the other features if we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
look at it again lots of reflectivity

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.950 
look at it again lots of reflectivity
lots<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> piping<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.869> know

lots of piping going on here you know
you're<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.470> looking<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you're kind of just looking at the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
you're kind of just looking at the
