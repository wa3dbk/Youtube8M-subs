on your computer as well once you've

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.759 
on your computer as well once you've
installed<00:00:23.310> everything<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:25.050> time<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.529> get

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
installed everything it's time to get

you do that is there are a variety of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600

different types of realms and there are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
different types of realms and there are
dozens<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.840> dozens<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.320> dozens<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.770> realms

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
dozens and dozens and dozens of realms

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
dozens and dozens and dozens of realms
you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.399> play<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> means<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you can play in and what that means is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
you can play in and what that means is
there<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.399> servers<00:00:38.910> spreader<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.430> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
there are servers spreader out the and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
there are servers spreader out the and
and<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.570> many<00:00:42.719> other<00:00:43.020> computer

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and like with many other computer

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.369 
and like with many other computer
systems<00:00:44.360> each<00:00:45.360> server<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:45.989> different

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
systems each server has different

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
systems each server has different
capacity<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.420> have

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
capacity so what you do is you have

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.979 
capacity so what you do is you have
several<00:00:48.989> servers<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.210> on<00:00:51.210> different<00:00:51.600> servers

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
several servers and on different servers

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
several servers and on different servers
you<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.379> different<00:00:52.680> realms<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.579> basically<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you have different realms so basically a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
you have different realms so basically a
realm<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.140> place<00:00:58.140> where<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.590> play

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
realm is just the place where you play

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.010 
realm is just the place where you play
and<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> characters<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> multiple

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and you can have characters in multiple

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
and you can have characters in multiple
different<00:01:01.170> realms<00:01:02.420> but<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.260> realm<00:01:04.680> if

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
different realms but your first realm if

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.679 
different realms but your first realm if
you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> friends<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> play<00:01:06.240> World<00:01:06.570> of
