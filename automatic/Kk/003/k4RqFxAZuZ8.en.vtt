00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 go well today we will do 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 still a little test with a new 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.619
 car so here I will leave you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.720
 discover these two cars there from 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 that it will be personalized so as 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 always I take the sport suspensions 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.730
 because that will be the goal of really 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.619
 to roll a maximum is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 really customize it as a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.980
 tuning car actually it's my 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.640
 goal in this series there so 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.420
 now we will put a little bit 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.420
 moment we will change the engine 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.030
 so I will make you a little pettiness 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 car like that so I'm in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.469
 train them in the process of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 to prepare 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.140
 so there are cars that I would do 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 not necessarily because they are not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 tuning so tractor all that so they 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.809
 do not go into the tuning garage 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 So it is useless to lower all 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.270
 simply customize it 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 so I'll take that cars that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 are customizable and cars a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.359
 little is sporty either typical or 4.4 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 either motorcycle but I would not take either 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 cars that we see all the time that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 a genre I do not say more between 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 way we'll see it depends on also after 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.180
 cars start doing that and that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.189
 because I realized that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.659
 cars frankly als do not 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 nothing at all but really nothing 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.020
 she looks like a nothing give way car 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 banal but as soon as the personalizes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.049
 we stay a little bit on the priest of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.939
 even speechless I said wow 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.200
 how beautiful is it that everything 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.880
 depends actually I'll take a little bit 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350
 all the cars I'm doing the test and in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 same time I frankly tightened 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 well complete this series so this will be 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.960
 at first as always a little test at 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.299
 garage and learn to test that out 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 circuit this is the goal in fact to see 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.630
 the push of the car what is 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.829
 that she has in her womb 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.360
 so there are paintings they are 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.460
 really nice my neck if the paintings 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.619
 it's not that I will not put the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 paintings that you like but I have 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 need we'll say to show a little 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.430
 little paints for sir all the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 world because why am I saying that because 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.610
 that I have already made cars with them 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.049
 atypical paintings of which I 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 do not want to put the same paint back 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.420
 that people tell me but you have 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.799
 already done this painting with such 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 car so I prefer a little bit 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.490
 left the chance for people by 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.100
 example who loves another another 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.329
 simply paint when that theirs 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.189
 lets see a few more 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.509
 accessories also on the next 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.660
 episodes that will happen in relation to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.560
 the car the car design 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.200
 but I honestly find it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.970
 really well thought their thing huh it's 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 there is something to be done but 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.610
 really happy here I am going to start 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.470
 a small one allows the sport suspension 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.980
 that's a frankly serving to be 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.599
 much more attached to the road 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.380
 race transmission makes it a little 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.730
 little a turbo so the wheels frankly 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.930
 I really appreciate that we are 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.069
 can really put what we want them 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.730
 wheels we really have a pretty range 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.890
 large 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.330
 so you have press and everyone knows where and 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.410
 its colors in that after a maybe 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.580
 that I would put wheels that are not going 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.530
 please you and other people who 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.980
 found it super fun at the super 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.500
 bowl 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.390
 so we'll see how it's going 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.590
 be personalized but the most 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.030
 important anyway I think it's 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.100
 the test I want to do right after 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.690
 in the small portion that is just all 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.069
 immediately behind 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.330
 it is the test of airports whose 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.200
 will really see the power of the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 car what is it in the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.360
 belly 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.069
 what is cars like that she 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.470
 mix loms gold mine 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.090
 it does not look good in fact but soon 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.160
 that we start hating years says wow 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
 what power and other cars 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.880
 who are super sporty thou 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.700
 customize in fact I say ok ah 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.500
 okay but there is nothing in the belly and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.670
 there knowing that I have a lot of money 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.709
 so I can really afford to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 customize a background the room the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 car but really thoroughly I have no 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640
 taboo we will say at the financial level 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.019
 this time here we will take the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.100
 shielding it's good everything is done 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.280
 so here's the little beast 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.230
 the beast is here so hoping 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.549
 you like it that's what that thinks 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.630
 and do not hesitate to leave me in 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.760
 comments I put a little 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.560
 improvement small smoke yellow smoke 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.700
 orange sorry that's when I'm going 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.690
 squeak wheels actually you have a 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.690
 little orange smoke that will come out 2 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.980
 madero I thought it was super fun 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.240
 made me really smile I thought 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.960
 oh that's really not bad that typical 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.980
 as a concept but I admit that it reflects 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.360
 every time I make friends relations 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.420
 quite different to do so do 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.640
 all the time the same there it is gone 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.620
 let's go to the airport so here you go 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.140
 at the airport it was fast 1 you have 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.690
 saw I teleport limit so the 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.920
 little drew orange that's it that's 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.990
 useful so I do not have a lot of time 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.430
 to show you what it looks like 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.770
 that and I have the cops in the ass it's 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.090
 party we were on circuit was going so 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.420
 helicopter that is starting to make me 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.560
 visit 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.760
 and there you will observe in book a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.230
 little bit do also cameras in 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.420
 third person like that it shows a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.760
 little more embedded cameras 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.050
 embedded earlier games I find it 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.730
 much more interesting to you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 show a little bit of all kinds of views 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.840
 it will simply allow us to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.200
 can come to see the car its speed 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.180
 its tip and how we see it from 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.650
 limits in third person or 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.330
 fuselage of helicopter or plane 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.700
 but this car there I admit 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.530
 she has a huge push of which she has 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.790
 a lot of potential including four regions 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.200
 that I burst behind it is not done 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.220
 too much what I just did not do 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.800
 of my fault it's not me and I was 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.730
 just september so here I was saying that 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.810
 this car she has a lot of 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.120
 potential is that it has a huge 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.320
 huge power acceleration there are some 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.680
 cars on a little bit less 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.860
 power 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.660
 I find that we lose very quickly 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.830
 check if we are not stable hong lei 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.210
 look good I'm trying to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.620
 to make limit stopped by the cops 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.250
 so it's not bad anyway 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.250
 of finding game 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.230
 so this car the round he is she 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.160
 really catastrophic why is 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.240
 say that as soon as there is a back 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.949
 donkey or whatever fought by 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.510
 a whole control is as soon as you 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.400
 go super fast with everything turbo 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.080
 everything is also under all these small 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.550
 improvements the voice the car has 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.110
 tendency from one side but one 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.040
 power but you do not even 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.350
 account or is that why I wanted 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.340
 really do the test on it's 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.720
 much more practical you that you 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.900
 will allow others that allows you to 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.430
 see the top speed live only if 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.840
 I do it on the city where there is 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 often contract we will say to be 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.510
 blocked by the population and so it's 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.310
 there I just lost a little bit my 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.540
 tracker we had to give subscribers 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.830
 it's not my fault and it's a 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.389
 expensive car but that's the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.590
 police who is a little bit bastia the 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.000
 week the father of raymond the hood late 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.850
 at home because I actually lost myself 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.400
 I lost the roof so I'm going to type 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.389
 the last straight line 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.320
 so do not hesitate to tell me really 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.060
 in the comments what what you 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.560
 think about this car there is that 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.570
 that's what you want often with 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.710
 if you like it or not 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.000
 too much where does she hold it well 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.010
 road and it's so do not hesitate to 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.199
 debate on the comments so here we go 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.460
 so that's the main no less end of 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.510
 series admitted to look good 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.880
 what am I doing all my 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.860
 cars will finish or so here at 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.289
