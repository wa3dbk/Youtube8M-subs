00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.010
 football education was disputed in Europe and after coupling at 20 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.900
 years in austria as it has been or how was that reintegration process 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.800
 to a country that saw you grow and what to do 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.440
 It is perceived 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 the text 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.030
 I was born here and twenty years that those who have goals that even time 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.020
 and from school 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 the tricolor and the refund and the oil 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.390
 this verb day have at this moment the entity remembered 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.870
 with all this I made olvera 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.800
 to feel in boy tastes I stopped him from facing my life 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.260
 by certain there was no German language for 16 years 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.149
 and in shooting the good work and its little 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.330
 hard 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.109
 but good for a hundred 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.269
 I am accustomed to 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.620
 to have to adapt the situation is because being my father football player 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.379
 we also play many times 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.759
 the one who doubts as in many times of school 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.389
 and good che 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.389
 I think the additions have shown a lot 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.779
 back entirely working and what it was that moved you to white 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.099
 the manacorense 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.030
 it's not a total 101 issue - the angels 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.940
 I went back laments for football is the next I was always a little 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.940
 Pending what happens in opinion because in the country of birth 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.009
 this 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.450
 never 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.569
 in Uruguay too 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.879
 one does not have as much contact with other foreigners that they speak another 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.049
 language or being in the background 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.340
 then this one forgot me the pulpos promises public 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.269
 soccer is now 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.169
 the public is a 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.869
 A sport that moves masses is a sport of passion and is a reflection of 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.779
 associated companies since it has between 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.789
 many of its weaknesses one that touches foreigners the most is racism as 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.789
 headquarters to that cluster as reflected in football 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.159
 well that I do think I have p think football is a mirror in society or 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.260
 not in every society in every country 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.099
 he has his way of living soccer that is a reflection in the socialist 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.319
 this god son that results sun 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.919
 is an example of this 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.359
 who we see here is very difficult to transport cargo 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.319
 efe 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.109
 African ccoo 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.109
 foreign codelco or with 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.239
 min my singing we interrupted 15 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.729
 this lookers 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.599
 can stop or be totally accepted 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.559
 in Italian football 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.930
 this is noticeable 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.850
 in another event 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.699
 says I say it too 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.949
 one of them 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.949
 when we were talking before pools to the studio 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.659
 you said you were petete you'll feel a lot of the commons linked as a 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.419
 mediator between the Austrian player and the foreign player 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.749
 if cimbronazo that finally this one 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.040
 there is a two minutes 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.270
 Two groups names are worthy 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.189
 Austrians and pines foreigners by foreigners 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.449
 that's why it came with a draw to zero but with 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.580
 p mike d many immigrants do not 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.889
 and well that's how I'm a 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.300
 a similar case all year 2 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.120
 benitez trains 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.580
 it has been easy for me to understand the two positions 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.919
 so I ask a lot of people 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.800
 a person in which 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.699
 both the two parties 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.949
 the singer 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.990
 to bet noah on forming tips 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.840
 all of them achievements and professional triumphs in the chapter have not 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.289
 been 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.240
 the great satisfaction to explain how is the acceptance of the public 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.389
 towards co 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.160
 and credible they have 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.150
 in a fast I felt very well I hope that thanks also to my 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.110
 father 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.110
 had a very good race, each one is the name too 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.550
 count a little - everything a lot because 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.659
 people do not feel 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.900
 I made quite a few tall Beijing 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 before a chat that we have oct we had a phenomenon that soccer recently 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.289
 that was the purchase of the players ronaldo udinese ivovich 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.900
 there were two very interesting aspects for me lira soccer 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:38.979
 with passion 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.939
 of the fanatic who is there and who delights that he sings the copper 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:48.239
 and at the same time marketing and advertising and the amount in millions of 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:51.090
 euros that is paid by a footballer like ronaldo 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.110
 in a country where the unemployment rate is high where there is a 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.439
 many economic problems what do you think of lisbon 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.439
 with its weight the prices of the celestial players are 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.199
 the wounded are jose aldasoro 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.909
 clear that if one of 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.909
 per cent what ronaldo costs and burned football worldwide 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.349
 jinán negligible part 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.009
 because because they pay so much money for ronaldo because they're going to win the war they're going 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.120
 Make p 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.750
 a lot of money with him 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.479
 +++ double 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.169
 understands why I remember when 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.160
 in this event 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.839
 the Brazilian team 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.479
 he received from the aek 400 million dollars for 10 years for being him 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.759
 in these loan events 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.900
 p 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.010
 they had it well thought because it was the ten years that I know him to ronaldinho 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.830
 in the Brazilian team then good for the shirts of the 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.969
 horror to the child 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.770
 more than 400 million euros 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.490
 and how do you explain 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.530
 if I thought that exact phenomenon on the one hand that passion of all 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.099
 the public and on the other hand football is really marketing the outgoing 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.099
 serene linen advertising is not out of what society is a society today 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.270
 in tomato day 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.270
 that is, if we see what all the castings are 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.229
 and everything that moves between television and television in a power 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.229
 very big 

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:16.149
 part of the global business that there is not 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.539
 in this sense he has given 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.029
 what are you doing so many 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:22.499
 it seems to me 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:23.749
 it's a little 

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:27.409
 It is difficult to say if it is right or wrong 7 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.879
 we are going to lower a bit the financial entities were few minutes to be 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:35.809

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:36.909

 in separate descents of the sector a good film is unknown to science museums 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.499
