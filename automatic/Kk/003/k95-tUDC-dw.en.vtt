dedicated servers which did this you

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.800 
dedicated servers which did this you
know<00:01:16.550> others<00:01:16.759> stay<00:01:16.910> away<00:01:17.119> from<00:01:17.180> them<00:01:17.479> we'd<00:01:17.630> go

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
know others stay away from them we'd go

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.429

have<00:01:21.560> another<00:01:21.799> way<00:01:21.950> modern<00:01:22.220> warfare<00:01:22.400> 2<00:01:22.700> even

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
have another way modern warfare 2 even

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.570 
have another way modern warfare 2 even
though<00:01:23.360> there<00:01:23.540> are<00:01:23.659> no<00:01:23.810> dedicated<00:01:24.020> servers

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
though there are no dedicated servers

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.950 
though there are no dedicated servers
this<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.729> done<00:01:25.939> also<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.450> console<00:01:26.900> i

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
this is done also on the console i

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.710 
this is done also on the console i
believe<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.500> basically<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.729> host<00:01:29.030> changes

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
believe and basically the host changes

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.200 
believe and basically the host changes
the<00:01:29.840> settings<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.500> server<00:01:31.490> somehow<00:01:31.970> I've

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
the settings of the server somehow I've

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.080 
the settings of the server somehow I've
lots<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.509> show<00:01:32.659> home<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.340> he<00:01:34.340> can<00:01:34.520> change<00:01:34.759> many

lots of show home and he can change many

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.090 
lots of show home and he can change many
things<00:01:35.180> like<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:35.689> said<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.080> speed<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.619> gravity

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
things like I said the speed the gravity

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.160 
things like I said the speed the gravity
the<00:01:37.880> amount<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.180> ammo<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.840> health<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:41.170> that's

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.100 
the amount of ammo the health and that's
pretty<00:01:42.380> much<00:01:42.530> all<00:01:42.770> late<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.579> do<00:01:43.820> really

and three times all three times was my

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
and three times all three times was my
chance<00:02:18.049> I'm<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:18.590> going<00:02:18.950> out<00:02:19.160> looking<00:02:19.340> for

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
chance I'm not going out looking for

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.300 
chance I'm not going out looking for
these<00:02:19.730> servers<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.040> know

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
these servers but I would like to know

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.420 
these servers but I would like to know
what<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.670> guys<00:02:22.819> think<00:02:23.150> about<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:24.340> bursting<00:02:25.340> in

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
what you guys think about it bursting in

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.130 
what you guys think about it bursting in
client<00:02:25.760> gets<00:02:25.940> kind<00:02:26.269> of<00:02:26.329> boring<00:02:26.390> after<00:02:27.049> a<00:02:27.079> while

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
client gets kind of boring after a while

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.580 
client gets kind of boring after a while
and<00:02:28.780> yeah<00:02:29.780> there's<00:02:29.959> not<00:02:30.079> much<00:02:30.230> else<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.500> say

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and yeah there's not much else to say

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.259 
and yeah there's not much else to say
really<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.370> would<00:02:31.549> like<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.760> know<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
really but I would like to know what you

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.199 
really but I would like to know what you
guys<00:02:32.299> think<00:02:32.599> about<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.760> ninety-nine

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
guys think about it this is ninety-nine

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.150 
guys think about it this is ninety-nine
percent<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.720> time<00:02:35.900> done<00:02:36.170> public<00:02:36.709> servers

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
percent of the time done public servers

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.699 
percent of the time done public servers
as<00:02:37.310> opposed<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.879> private<00:02:38.180> servers<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.989> all

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
as opposed to private servers and all

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.170 
as opposed to private servers and all
the<00:02:39.829> kills<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.310> deaths<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.670> achievements

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the kills and deaths and achievements

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.550 
the kills and deaths and achievements
and<00:02:41.269> challenges<00:02:41.329> that<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.959> make<00:02:42.170> our

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
and challenges that you make our

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.979 
and challenges that you make our
attitude<00:02:43.099> profile<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.510> essence<00:02:44.870> this

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
attitude profile so in essence this

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.869 
attitude profile so in essence this
could<00:02:45.200> be<00:02:45.319> deemed<00:02:45.530> as<00:02:45.859> cheating<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.579> he<00:02:46.670> can

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
could be deemed as cheating as he can

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.699 
could be deemed as cheating as he can
use<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.209> your<00:02:47.269> advantage<00:02:47.349> even<00:02:48.349> though<00:02:48.500> is

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
use it to your advantage even though is

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.860 
use it to your advantage even though is
really<00:02:48.950> at<00:02:49.129> my<00:02:49.160> disadvantage<00:02:49.609> here<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.329> didn't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
really at my disadvantage here I didn't

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
really at my disadvantage here I didn't
do<00:02:50.959> too<00:02:51.170> well<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.280> think<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.579> is<00:02:52.670> one<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
do too well but I think this is one of

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.580 
do too well but I think this is one of
the<00:02:52.970> reasons<00:02:53.269> why<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.660> Infinity<00:02:54.379> Ward

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the reasons why I think Infinity Ward

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.229 
the reasons why I think Infinity Ward
should<00:02:54.739> ban<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.160> kind<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.489> thing<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.790> fix<00:02:56.000> it

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
should ban this kind of thing and fix it

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.240 
should ban this kind of thing and fix it
in<00:02:56.390> an<00:02:56.510> update<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.170> we'll<00:02:57.859> probably<00:02:58.010> being

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
in an update and we'll probably being

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.259 
in an update and we'll probably being
the<00:02:58.310> list<00:02:58.519> where<00:02:58.760> many<00:02:58.880> people<00:02:58.940> are

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
the list where many people are

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.940 
the list where many people are
supporting<00:02:59.599> these<00:02:59.690> servers<00:02:59.959> as<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> said

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
supporting these servers as like I said

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.949 
supporting these servers as like I said
you<00:03:01.099> can<00:03:01.130> use<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.609> your<00:03:01.670> advantage<00:03:01.959> but

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
you can use it to your advantage but

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.270 
you can use it to your advantage but
