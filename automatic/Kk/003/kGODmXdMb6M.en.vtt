00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
Museum of African culture because of the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.950 
Museum of African culture because of the
fact<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.550> highest<00:03:05.880> concentration<00:03:06.840> of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.030

think people will love it I think it's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.870

going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> draw<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.790> tremendous<00:03:18.360> crowd
