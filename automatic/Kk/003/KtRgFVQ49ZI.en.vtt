00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
overhead tricep press which you see me

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.599 
overhead tricep press which you see me
doing<00:00:23.529> right<00:00:23.650> here<00:00:23.980> I'm<00:00:24.130> doing<00:00:24.279> about<00:00:24.460> a

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
doing right here I'm doing about a

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.169 
doing right here I'm doing about a
hundred<00:00:24.939> pounds<00:00:25.089> I<00:00:25.570> usually<00:00:26.439> do<00:00:27.000> 120<00:00:28.000> with<00:00:28.150> a

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
hundred pounds I usually do 120 with a

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.029 
hundred pounds I usually do 120 with a
spotter<00:00:28.630> but<00:00:28.929> since<00:00:29.289> I<00:00:29.380> don't<00:00:29.439> have<00:00:29.710> one<00:00:29.919> I'm

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
spotter but since I don't have one I'm

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.060 
spotter but since I don't have one I'm
just<00:00:30.070> doing<00:00:30.400> one<00:00:30.490> hundred<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:31.680> you<00:00:32.680> alternate

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
just doing one hundred and you alternate

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.700 
just doing one hundred and you alternate
between<00:00:33.100> this<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.390> one-arm<00:00:35.020> tricep

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
between this and the one-arm tricep

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.610 
between this and the one-arm tricep
extension<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.239> do<00:00:37.390> them<00:00:37.510> right<00:00:37.809> after

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
extension and you do them right after

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:52.410 
extension and you do them right after
one<00:00:39.190> another<00:00:39.399> no<00:00:40.000> break<00:00:40.480> in<00:00:40.660> between<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.180> here

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
one another no break in between so here

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
one another no break in between so here
I'm<00:00:52.570> starting<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.230> one<00:00:53.680> on<00:00:53.859> tricep<00:00:54.789> extension

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I'm starting the one on tricep extension

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.770 
I'm starting the one on tricep extension
this<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.609> reason<00:00:57.850> why<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:57.969> call<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.539> the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
this is the reason why I call this the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.500 
this is the reason why I call this the
best<00:00:59.109> workout<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.699> combination<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.390> these

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
best workout the combination of these

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.079 
best workout the combination of these
two<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.890> first<00:01:03.160> exercise

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
two the first exercise

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.149 
two the first exercise
it's<00:01:04.600> really<00:01:04.930> good<00:01:05.259> for<00:01:05.470> focusing<00:01:05.979> on

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
it's really good for focusing on

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.050 
it's really good for focusing on
strength<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.920> focuses<00:01:08.920> more<00:01:09.220> on<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.820> long

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
strength and it focuses more on the long

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.230 
strength and it focuses more on the long
head<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.450> tricep<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.670> exercise

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
head of the tricep and this exercise

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.690 
head of the tricep and this exercise
basically<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.140> burns<00:01:14.439> out<00:01:14.680> every<00:01:15.520> single

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
basically just burns out every single

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.480 
basically just burns out every single
head<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> tricep<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.409> really<00:01:18.159> think<00:01:18.400> it

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
head of the tricep so I really think it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.350 
head of the tricep so I really think it
is<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.630> great<00:01:20.110> combo<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:22.030> basically

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
is a great combo you're basically

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.770 
is a great combo you're basically
working<00:01:22.930> all<00:01:23.759> head<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.000> tricep<00:01:25.479> during

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
working all head to the tricep during

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.929 
working all head to the tricep during
this<00:01:25.869> workout<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.710> sorry<00:01:27.189> about<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.640> light

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.400 

you<00:02:27.870> notice<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:29.629> shook<00:02:30.629> my<00:02:30.810> arms<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
you notice that I just shook my arms a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.839 
you notice that I just shook my arms a
little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.830> try<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.250> get<00:02:32.430> some<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.760> that

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
little bit try and get some of that

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.089 
little bit try and get some of that
lactic<00:02:33.300> acid<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:33.989> could<00:02:34.260> get<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.709> few

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
lactic acid out so I could get a few

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.270 
lactic acid out so I could get a few
more<00:02:35.400> reps<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.830> second<00:02:38.250> set<00:02:38.430> of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
more reps in and for the second set of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.050 
more reps in and for the second set of
tricep<00:02:41.280> extensions<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.730> should<00:02:45.030> alternate

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
tricep extensions you should alternate

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.670 
tricep extensions you should alternate
