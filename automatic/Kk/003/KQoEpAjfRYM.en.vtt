00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
your base is perfectly set before you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
your base is perfectly set before you
begin<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.310> want<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> right<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:20.910> when

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you spike in the first few pieces of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.980 
you spike in the first few pieces of
edging<00:00:23.310> dumping<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> sin<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.390> spreading<00:00:24.900> that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
edging dumping in sin and spreading that

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
edging dumping in sin and spreading that
around<00:00:25.050> isn't<00:00:25.619> necessarily<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.460> consumer

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
around isn't necessarily a time consumer

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
around isn't necessarily a time consumer
but<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:28.289> exacting<00:00:28.859> when

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
but it is a little more exacting when

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
but it is a little more exacting when
you<00:00:29.070> start<00:00:29.340> speeding<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
you start speeding that out with a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.319 
you start speeding that out with a
couple<00:00:30.660> one-inch<00:00:31.080> pipes<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.830> guides<00:00:32.329> but

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
couple one-inch pipes as your guides but

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
couple one-inch pipes as your guides but
with<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> good<00:00:33.690> start<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.739> then

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
with a good start like that you are then

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.639 
with a good start like that you are then
ready<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.460> set<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:35.969> pavers<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:37.170> before<00:00:37.530> we

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
ready to set some pavers but before we

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
ready to set some pavers but before we
get<00:00:37.770> too<00:00:38.100> far<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.790> take<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> look<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.719> what

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
get too far let's take a look at what

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.670 
get too far let's take a look at what
we're<00:00:40.170> using

Cambridge has kind of slightly rounded
edges<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> lot<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> cobblestone<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.780> might

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
edges a lot like a cobblestone you might

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.920 
edges a lot like a cobblestone you might
find<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.800> street<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> 1800s<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.690> are

gave us and we are using pattern B I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.480 
gave us and we are using pattern B I
have<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.380> pieces<00:01:07.619> laid<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.220> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
have some pieces laid out here for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
have some pieces laid out here for
reference<00:01:08.970> since<00:01:09.630> everything<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.110> based<00:01:10.350> on

three and six inch increments it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
three and six inch increments it's
relatively<00:01:12.450> easy<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> layout<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> get

line to do that and if you find that you
need<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.140> tweak<00:03:16.380> things<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.680> little<00:03:16.770> bit<00:03:16.950> you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
need to tweak things a little bit you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.580 
need to tweak things a little bit you
can<00:03:17.220> use<00:03:17.250> your<00:03:17.520> adjuster<00:03:18.110> just<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.260> ahead<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
can use your adjuster just go ahead and

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.650 
can use your adjuster just go ahead and
make<00:03:19.709> sure<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:19.980> each<00:03:20.340> stone<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.700> looking

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
make sure that each stone is looking

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.080 
make sure that each stone is looking
good<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.410> we'll<00:03:22.560> be<00:03:22.650> good<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.800> go<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:24.060> right

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
good and we'll be good to go all right

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.520 
good and we'll be good to go all right
now<00:03:24.180> we're<00:03:24.390> doing<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.690> soldier<00:03:25.050> course<00:03:25.290> around

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
now we're doing a soldier course around

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.320 
now we're doing a soldier course around
the<00:03:25.650> entire<00:03:25.980> driveway<00:03:26.580> now<00:03:26.730> rather<00:03:26.940> than<00:03:27.090> just

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
the entire driveway now rather than just

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.110 
the entire driveway now rather than just
using<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:27.930> size<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> entire<00:03:29.490> soldier

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
using one size for the entire soldier

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.000 
using one size for the entire soldier
which<00:03:30.600> kind<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.020> makes<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.620> stick<00:03:31.830> out<00:03:31.950> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
which kind of makes it stick out a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.140 
which kind of makes it stick out a
little<00:03:32.130> bit<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.370> sometimes<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:32.940> kind<00:03:33.120> of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
little bit more sometimes it's kind of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.880 
little bit more sometimes it's kind of
nice<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.360> accent<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.140> whole<00:03:34.170> driver<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
nice to accent the whole driver with a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.140 
nice to accent the whole driver with a
border<00:03:35.220> we're<00:03:35.340> trying<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:35.730> something<00:03:36.000> that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
border we're trying to do something that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.180 
border we're trying to do something that
sort<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.870> blends<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.590> everything<00:03:37.650> else

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
sort of blends in with everything else

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.590 
sort of blends in with everything else
we're<00:03:38.459> using<00:03:38.610> all<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> pieces<00:03:39.240> in<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
we're using all the pieces in the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140 
we're using all the pieces in the
soldier<00:03:39.930> course<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.709> 6-inch<00:03:41.160> width<00:03:41.490> all<00:03:41.970> the

soldier course the 6-inch width all the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.940 
soldier course the 6-inch width all the
way<00:03:42.270> down<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> think<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.770> should<00:03:43.890> be

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
way down I think it I think it should be

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650 
way down I think it I think it should be
a<00:03:44.040> nice<00:03:44.160> way<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.550> there's<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.450> many

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
a nice way to go there's a many

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.850 
a nice way to go there's a many
different<00:03:45.720> ways<00:03:46.020> of<00:03:46.170> set<00:03:46.350> pavers<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.740> way<00:03:46.830> I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
different ways of set pavers the way I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.500 
different ways of set pavers the way I
could<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.760> take<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> paver

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
could do it is that you take the paver

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.510 
could do it is that you take the paver
slide<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.020> along<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.350> side<00:03:49.680> straight<00:03:50.310> down
