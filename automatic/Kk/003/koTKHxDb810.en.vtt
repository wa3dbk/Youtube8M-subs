00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.660
 hello friends there they hang you I am a cartoonist and we are here to give 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.380
 still much more chain of protection for the planet if you are 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.910
 of those who do not care about this index is that we're going to die anyway 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 It seems obvious that the shit we repeat and reiterate that this is not a 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.800
 game is real life 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.460
 the world is decaying and it's all our fault so you know 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.769
 note the trash in its place 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.269
 do not forget to recycle tell not to the deforestation take care of your beaches do not pollute 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.820
 with any kind of threat and especially never turn on are cans in forests 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.210
 and if you are going to do it under the supervision of someone who knows 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.970
 care of the environment since you can cause a fire that is much worse 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.810
 that cut down the trees 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.579
 true 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.399
 and also remember that industries are one of the main causes of 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.140
 deterioration of the planet 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.310
 no matter how much those industries help us, more harm does that which benefits 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.440
 others 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 please 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 one of our hands at least this world if we can 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.170
 we are able to achieve it 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 and although they do not create it 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 another of the main causes is the reproduction of the population 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 This is so because the more the population index increases the more the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.240
 level of consumption and more industries will be necessary for that population 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.020
 and remember if we do not want to get to this 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 then do not pollute 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.090
 well now tqm nani will tell us a little more about what we can do to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.260
 avoid these destructions although you do not believe it in such a teaching state go down and 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.539
 there is a lot of pollution and the selection with the materials 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.840
 that's why we need your help 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.850
 stop smoking because that pollutes the air 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 if we do this we will improve except in the cañar in the squares lives 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.320
 if they make fun I was attentive to the shit because we tried 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 change something that is true 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.340
 well with this we hope it has been clear to you how very important it is 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.439
 for us to take care of our beautiful land and you know 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.439
 if we see someone polluting 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.189
