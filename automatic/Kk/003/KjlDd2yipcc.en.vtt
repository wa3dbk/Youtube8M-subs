00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
inches of length on either side so just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.929 
inches of length on either side so just
keep<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> mind<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> six<00:01:44.790> foot

keep that in mind if you have a six foot

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.219 
keep that in mind if you have a six foot
wide<00:01:45.090> trailer<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> might<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.079> able<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
wide trailer you might not be able to

wide trailer you might not be able to
move<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:49.430> also<00:01:50.430> too<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.060> reason<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.140> buy

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
move it so also too I have reason to buy

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
move it so also too I have reason to buy
six<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.649> size<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.159> creates<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.460> gap<00:01:53.840> along

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
six on the size it creates a gap along

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.249 
six on the size it creates a gap along
the<00:01:54.990> bottom<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> move<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the bottom so when you go to move it you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.100 
the bottom so when you go to move it you
won't<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.770> ripping<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.250> yours<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.570> supports

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
won't be ripping off yours for supports
in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.130> process<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.060> building<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
in the process so like to do building it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
in the process so like to do building it
on<00:02:03.600> dirt<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.140> something<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:05.100> ground<00:02:05.460> or

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
on dirt or something or ground or

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.389 
on dirt or something or ground or
whatever<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:07.259> won't<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.530> ripping<00:02:07.829> those<00:02:07.979> off

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
whatever you won't be ripping those off

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.440 
whatever you won't be ripping those off
when<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> pull<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> onto<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> trailer

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
when you pull it onto a trailer

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.190 
when you pull it onto a trailer
and<00:02:11.080> vice<00:02:11.319> versa<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:13.660> where<00:02:14.020> we're<00:02:14.140> at

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
and vice versa so that's where we're at

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.089 
and vice versa so that's where we're at
at<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.530> stage<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:16.090> process<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> you're

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
at this stage of the process so you're

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.920 
at this stage of the process so you're
looking<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.459> again<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.269> foot<00:02:19.510> centers

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
looking at again just one foot centers

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.979 
looking at again just one foot centers
of<00:02:21.000> two-by-fours<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.239> all<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.599> means<00:02:22.780> is

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
of two-by-fours and all that means is

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.710 
of two-by-fours and all that means is
the<00:02:23.739> son<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.099> two-by-four<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.879> every<00:02:25.420> foot

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the son of the two-by-four is every foot

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.320 
the son of the two-by-four is every foot
except<00:02:26.410> for<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.560> outer<00:02:26.739> edges<00:02:26.950> where<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.400> see

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
except for the outer edges where you see

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.240 
except for the outer edges where you see
here<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.720> flush<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:28.989> off<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.830> outside

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
here you flush it off for the outside

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.150 
here you flush it off for the outside
ones<00:02:30.489> all<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.849> others<00:02:31.180> they're<00:02:31.420> centered

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
ones all the others they're centered

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.949 
ones all the others they're centered
just<00:02:33.160> on<00:02:33.280> these<00:02:33.400> lines<00:02:33.640> she<00:02:33.880> i<00:02:33.940> drew<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:36.959> can

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
just on these lines she i drew you can

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.070 
just on these lines she i drew you can
also<00:02:38.080> here<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.440> flushed<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.720> i<00:02:40.840> just

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
also here to flushed it so and i just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.199 
also here to flushed it so and i just
give<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.470> extension<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.370> i<00:02:42.400> could<00:02:42.700> back<00:02:43.180> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
give it the extension so i could back it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.110 
give it the extension so i could back it
up<00:02:43.510> i<00:02:43.890> pull<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.950> forward<00:02:45.190> or<00:02:45.580> pull<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
up i pull it forward or pull it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880 
up i pull it forward or pull it
backwards<00:02:46.510> depending<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.349> where<00:02:47.530> i'm<00:02:47.620> placing

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
backwards depending on where i'm placing

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.360 
backwards depending on where i'm placing
it<00:02:48.190> next<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.380> where<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.890> projects

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it next so that is where the projects

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.160 
it next so that is where the projects
it's<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.940> i'm<00:02:52.030> going<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.299> make<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> cut<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
it's and i'm going to make the cut and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.660 
it's and i'm going to make the cut and
then<00:02:53.349> finish<00:02:53.680> screwing<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.160> decking<00:02:54.519> down

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
then finish screwing the decking down

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.600 
then finish screwing the decking down
and<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:55.900> i'll<00:02:56.049> show<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> brief<00:02:56.650> video<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.430> what

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
and then i'll show a brief video of what

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
and then i'll show a brief video of what
the<00:02:57.790> final<00:02:58.030> product<00:02:58.329> looks<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.870> for<00:02:59.110> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the final product looks like for the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.500 
the final product looks like for the
floor
