 both the demand is strong for google and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.720
 lg who seems to have underestimated the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.280
 request on this product 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.200
 it is important to keep 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.550
 the advanced on their mobile competitors 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.079
 world congress which takes place the month

 allow all the builders

 to announce their novelties for 2013 this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.799
 nexus cac could well become has 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.789
 been before we could even be 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.789
 widely distributed 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:14.100
 microsoft office 2013 is available 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.479
 in addition to a complete re design of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.429
 the interface of applications that the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.979
 make up the office suite adopts 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.600
 definitely the cloud so by default 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.909
 your documents are now stored in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 online thanks to skydrive interesting idea 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.179
 to find all this document whatever 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 the computer on which you 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.600
 work the license of use 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.969
 grants the right to install

 2013 office on up to five computers 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.459
 other novelty the mode of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.259
 marketing 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.420
 in addition to a classic purchase in version 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.670
 box from 140 euros for the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 2013 family and student office version

 the office 365 offer for a price of 99 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.429
 euros a year small flat microsoft does not 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.139
 offers more rates in update 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.060
 as it was already the case for office 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.920
 2010 and with a strong integration of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 online office is getting closer to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.709
 opportunities offered by its 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.659
 google docs competitors 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.289
 but keeping a paid model this 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289
 which remains quite expensive 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.690
 it's next week that the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.100
 pro surface computers so in the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.960
 trade for the moment in the united states 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.700
 and as was the case for surface 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.020
 some microsoft has communicated on the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.990
 useful storage on its shelves 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 so for surface rt the model 32 gigas 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.130
 ours is actually only 16 giga 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.110
 available disk space the rest 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.400
 being occupied by the surface system 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 pro it's a bit the same 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.440
 128 giga model will only offer 83 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.020
 spaces really usable as to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.570
 64 gigabyte models it will only leave 23 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.400
 giga species discuss it is because 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.410
 the windows 8 system and applications 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.620
 pre-installed that occupy a total of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.180
 40 5 gigas while the balance of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.190
 thematic channels launched by youtube in 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.870
 2012 is rather mixed, including 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.670
 France where the results are very 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.500
 unequal the video platform would be in 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.850
 studying a new model of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.410
 income for the eyes you die doing 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.660
 pay access to Internet users 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.400
 according to the American website adjedj youtube 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.410
 or so approached several stars of his 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.790
 platform by offering them to charge 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.040
 Internet users access to their channels 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.750
 between 1 and 5 dollars this model is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.670
 brings television closer and closer 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 or paid content has proven itself 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.940
 youtube could also unveil 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.920
 offers on paid access for 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.360
 live broadcasts all this info 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.750
 could be formalized in the month 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.730
 April 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.440
 to follow the question of the day comes to us 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.910
 of olive tree who ask us what 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.700
 are the real differences between them 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.320
 the 3g and the 4g is well olive the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.709
 main difference is obviously the 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.750
 speed 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.340
 so let's talk numbers the 3g allows 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.250
 to reach 2 megabits per second either 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.930
 about 256 KB per second the 3g plus 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.400
 it can go up to 20 mega bit 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.780
 but the 4g goes much further 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.760
 since she is able to reach 100 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 megabits per second or about 11 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.600
 megawatts and this corresponds to the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.010
 speed of a LAN in ethernet the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.480
 4g will allow playing games in 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.340
 streaming but also to watch from the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.750
 hd video on his mobile 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.190
 for the moment there is very little 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.570
 compatible devices let alone 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.850
 strip existing relay 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.620
 sfr and orange launched the 4g in 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.180
 a few neighborhoods in paris this week 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.489
 but it will take a few months 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.660
 for a more global deployment 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.670
 nor is it finished for today and 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.530
 be careful do not miss the show of 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.209
 tomorrow in a competition that will be 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.950
 broadcast live tomorrow night on 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.520
 dailymotion I will have the pleasure of 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.230
 participate alongside others 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
 web personalities at a race of 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.830
 cars on a gaming platform 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.120
 rather unusual and be attentive 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.410
 if you like racing games 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.209
 cars on consoles there will be a 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.040
 great gift to win for all those 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.690
 who will support you on twitter on 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.430
 explains everything in the show of 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.550
