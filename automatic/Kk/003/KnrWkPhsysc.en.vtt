00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.919
 if the 1 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.179
 Things connect the mountains with each other to date as a contradiction 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 namely the freedom of association 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.689
 can move freely under a saddle and the claim of the veterinarians 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.620
 and veterinarians and physiotherapists chiropractors that they as one as possible 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.739
 short thing with as much shoulder room as the little is booted 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.120
 but the large contact surface has us the need of the rider and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790
 Poets to be fair 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 Every move intensively feels every movement rhythm with Newron 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 can 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.240
 Tel the 1 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.360
 is a satellite that emerged out of practice from this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.530
 Thoughts out the shoulder-room has been constructed in which something of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.880
 Cushion was omitted 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.850
 Elastic joint stripper has been constructed around the prima Stephen pressure of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.280
 Loosen soil back 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.920
 and the special short test has been developed to make us a relative one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 large bearing surface on a very short modern conveys what got 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.590
 the result of that before you see it as nice to ride the side in the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780
 one-day drives and and will if the clubs in this date too 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.410
 Act immediately feels 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.240
 the confidence continues 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.260
 The PRI are resting and once causing a sensation 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.460
 as well as Olympic champion Hinrich Romeike feel now many top riders 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.070
 said this innovative 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 Kathrin Meyer zu Strohen one of the most successful trainers for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 Young dressage horses describe what convinced them 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 so he just took it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 would be open 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.659
 take the Main instead changed 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.070
 Christies one reveals and 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.770
 So you could really feel it immediately percent and also demonstrate it 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.390
 that it would have been St as soon as Okah 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.800
 wanted to get started right away 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 and so the difference was very serious for me, too 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.280
 In the later further work BASF may perhaps prove too simple 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.320
 if only you moved together 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.559
 and NASA also Nina von Alcon Euro is actually belonged 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.769
 Burning Fat has now been on the World Series 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 and successfully I place mine 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.040
 for me that has a very important meaning in connection with them 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.289
 with the saddle it existed 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.179
 he was quite the wait 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.829
 to feel very clearly how you have reissued on the other side 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.269
 "That just looked at him then he started to squeeze himself down so she was back 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.949
 together 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.709
 simple and from the whole 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.430
 this whole spectrum of returnees at once partly way of form of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.249
 Fighters for values ​​had the Kiel lie fact, however, the plot 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.269
 Just start racing 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.619
 Martin Schmitt can be said to limit natural beauties 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:54.149
 or in the opposite case to see clearly here in the right picture 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.149
 support and promote 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.339
 In the trot and Imke Duplitzer possible to do the more relaxed as well as the wide 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.209
 Chambers optimal head movement to get a light states 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.209
 failed 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.959
 Such an old Wells Fargo Richard Barrons will now be at the championship 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.290
 The young horses can be very successful 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.869
 why a satellite that fits the stand 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.279
 in the movement is often too tight 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.309
 by realizing that they were especially reliable in 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.389
 Equipment Condition you can see it here very nice as the name says 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.230
 Body falls 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.359
 if Muslims should look at it 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.089
 Wai this situation you can do that a bit more extreme by the 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.359
 Field completely burned out 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.159
 you notice two things that one time the weather is a bit bigger in the movement 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.439
 I now show the maximum amplitude 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.619
 and it gets wider that is, who fits the page that is in motion 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.569
 always too tight 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.529
 topic 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.529
 to visualize the inappropriate sheet 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.650
 inappropriate in the sense of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.419
 you can continue on 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.789
 what to look for this saddle 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.479
 in the loose to look at city 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.290
 this one said 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.620
 does not fit in the classical sense 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.860
 that is, the pollard willow continues to prepare the place far one to two times 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.750
 continue 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.960
 as a result of that, it is not a stop in the site 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.580
 stands 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.340
 if I then the saddle 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.650
 the bottom underneath is only dug in the rear area 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.650
 and in the front area completely in Asten Schiss 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.979
 answer with the back strip 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.080
 is the saddle 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.319
 exclusively by these commandments and 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.050
 she stands firm now I have the effect of one too wide 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.059
 Bartels 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.009
 Imke sense of the climate taking 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.800
 on a horse 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.360
 The second man is actually needed for this is needed 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.610
 The elastic photo stopper only has a leading function 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.360
 no Kotenev function 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.979
 This has the consequence that if now in the rear 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.360
 Land in the fourth hole is that you only maximum 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.599
 in the fourth stanza becomes foreground 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.379
 otherwise, the page would 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.560
 in front of the Cen 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.469
 this is always true 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:32.839
 elastic 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.939
 That does not mean the thoracic spine is under the saddle 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:37.889
 maximum 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.310
 possible the maximum amount of freedom of shoulder what this species in the 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.630
 Compared to each other 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.589
 market standard saddle brings 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.469
 is a recess 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.029
 in the front area 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.770
 the saddle cushion was made 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.600
 that means a half moon shaped housewives know in Sattledt 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.210
 the shoulder 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.240
 March tip gives the opportunity 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.660
 after to go through in agility 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.980
 You can always be an almost normal in any state just in the riot 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.650
 just be in the way 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.879
 a maximum freedom of Schilderwald peak achieved with it 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.330
 what ways can one build a French pillow here? 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.569
 always very different from the classic Keith Gessen 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.650
 which would extend that much 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.740
 it carries 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.810
 in today's modern color bill because we are essential today 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.449
 shorter middle school have to move on more in Verden 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.470
 One can do this in about the discharge of denial 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.129
 notice that the saddle Nobis should be here if you have the 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.699
 devastating falls in the back, the rear area should be without contact one 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:44.699
 Be saddle 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.120
 and that he is for this site by his French guests that the saddle 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.199
 in the back is slightly in the air is wanted and should be so 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.210
 I have to say that is 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.960
 then he says of first 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.020
 currently totally enthusiastic what not always so soft already 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.830
 different says tried 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.400
 certainly custom times, small acclimation phase admonish this clearly 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.400
 this page was just right away 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.269
 The law should, of course, be something for me "The most important thing is 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.449
 that this will feel good 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.449
 if 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 Please note 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:43.580
 So for me there is no better side or the procedure 

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:47.239
 Of course, we also had each other changed who the club before 

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:48.650
 two weeks for the 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.610
 you get 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.340
 you just feel so good 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.770
 You can tell that they are open to them
