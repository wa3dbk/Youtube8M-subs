finger at the top of the sensor without
touching<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.849> can<00:02:26.269> see<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.040> LED

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
touching it so you can see that the LED

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.839 
touching it so you can see that the LED
turns<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.319> detects<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.860> presence<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.670> an

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
turns on so it detects a presence of an

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.099 
turns on so it detects a presence of an
object<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.019> see<00:02:36.319> here<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:39.049> a

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
object you can see here so this is a

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.190 
object you can see here so this is a
very<00:02:39.350> simple<00:02:39.709> sensor<00:02:40.579> which<00:02:41.239> we<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.720> use<00:02:41.989> in

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
very simple sensor which we can use in

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.870 
very simple sensor which we can use in
many<00:02:42.350> robotic<00:02:43.340> related<00:02:43.730> applications<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.190> one

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
many robotic related applications so one

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.470 
many robotic related applications so one
of<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.120> main<00:02:47.269> examples<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:49.480> line

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
of the main examples is for line

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.780 
of the main examples is for line
follower<00:02:50.750> robot

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.789 

so<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.129> want<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.519> logic<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.269> a

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
so if you want the logic to be a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.520 
so if you want the logic to be a
vice-versa<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:59.519> it<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:01.019> output<00:03:01.170> should

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
vice-versa like it out the output should

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.160 
vice-versa like it out the output should
be<00:03:01.739> high<00:03:02.549> when<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.360> pleasure

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
be high when you pleasure

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.670 
be high when you pleasure
if<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.099> sensor<00:03:05.879> finds<00:03:06.239> any<00:03:06.450> obstacle<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.470> has

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
if the sensor finds any obstacle it has

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.960 
if the sensor finds any obstacle it has
to<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:08.129> low

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
to go low

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.460 
to go low
all<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.599> have<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:12.690> interchange

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
all you have to do is just interchange

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.990 
all you have to do is just interchange
the<00:03:16.190> just<00:03:17.190> interchange<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:20.000> potential

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the just interchange the potential

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
the just interchange the potential
potential<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:22.049> meet<00:03:22.230> our<00:03:22.379> output<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.069> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
potential to meet our output to the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.429 
potential to meet our output to the
second<00:03:23.730> pin<00:03:23.939> and<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.659> sensor<00:03:24.959> output<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
second pin and the sensor output the

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.630 
second pin and the sensor output the
third<00:03:26.010> pin<00:03:26.310> I'm<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.150> interchange<00:03:27.480> this

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
third pin I'm going to interchange this

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.970 
third pin I'm going to interchange this
so<00:03:29.640> I'm<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.269> take<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.810> cell<00:03:31.079> potential

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
so I'm going to take the cell potential

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.399 
so I'm going to take the cell potential
meet<00:03:32.340> our<00:03:32.549> output<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.540> second<00:03:33.930> pin<00:03:34.139> and

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
meet our output to the second pin and

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:44.040 
meet our output to the second pin and
the<00:03:35.190> sensor<00:03:35.639> output<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:37.190> third<00:03:38.190> pin

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.420 

I'm<00:03:44.500> connecting<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.100> battery<00:03:45.250> now<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.310> you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
I'm connecting the battery now so if you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.200 
I'm connecting the battery now so if you
see<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.630> output<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:50.050> always<00:03:50.680> high<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:52.060> if

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
see that the output is always high so if

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.880 
see that the output is always high so if
I<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.280> finds<00:03:54.520> any<00:03:54.850> obstacle<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.560> output

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
I if it is finds any obstacle the output

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.839 
I if it is finds any obstacle the output
goes<00:03:57.100> low

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.009 

so<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.689> is<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.019> very<00:04:04.349> simple<00:04:04.799> sensor<00:04:05.840> if<00:04:06.840> you

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
so this is a very simple sensor if you

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.649 
so this is a very simple sensor if you
are<00:04:07.139> not<00:04:07.349> getting<00:04:07.560> any<00:04:08.010> output<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:09.480> make

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
are not getting any output just make

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:20.740 
are not getting any output just make
sure<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:11.180> vary<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.420> resistance

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.760 

so<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.530> we<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.860> get<00:04:22.070> any<00:04:22.280> output<00:04:23.500> see<00:04:24.500> here

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
so that we can get any output see here

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.250 
so that we can get any output see here
there<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.190> no<00:04:25.370> food<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.360> if<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.990> are<00:04:27.110> not

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
there is no food so if you are not

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.610 
there is no food so if you are not
getting<00:04:27.560> any<00:04:27.740> output<00:04:28.570> like<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.560> have

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
getting any output like this so you have

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.840 
getting any output like this so you have
to<00:04:30.950> vary<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.370> resistance<00:04:32.920> now<00:04:33.920> getting

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
to vary the resistance now getting

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.670 
to vary the resistance now getting
output<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.540> if<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.780> place<00:04:35.990> for<00:04:36.200> any<00:04:36.470> obstacles

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
output so if I place for any obstacles

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:45.790 
output so if I place for any obstacles
in<00:04:37.240> sensor<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.750> output<00:04:39.080> goes<00:04:39.350> low<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:44.530> if<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
in sensor the output goes low so if the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.130 
in sensor the output goes low so if the
problem<00:04:46.070> comes<00:04:46.820> in<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.150> sensor<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.990> you

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
problem comes in this sensor that you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.560 
problem comes in this sensor that you
are<00:04:48.260> not<00:04:48.350> getting<00:04:48.710> any<00:04:48.950> output<00:04:49.450> first<00:04:50.450> you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
are not getting any output first you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.470 
are not getting any output first you
have<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.930> check<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:52.480> variable

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
have to check the a variable

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.240 
have to check the a variable
potentiometer<00:04:54.140> that<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:54.920> variable

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
potentiometer that is a variable

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.470 
potentiometer that is a variable
resistor<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:59.110> make<00:05:00.110> sure<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:02.150> IR

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
resistor and make sure that the IR

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.160 
resistor and make sure that the IR
receiver<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.500> in<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.860> reverse<00:05:04.130> polarity<00:05:05.170> if

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
receiver is in the reverse polarity if

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:16.280 
receiver is in the reverse polarity if
we<00:05:06.350> are<00:05:06.440> not<00:05:06.590> getting<00:05:06.950> any<00:05:07.070> output

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.400 

thank<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.980> for<00:05:17.160> watching
