00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
that's the obvious or no entry yes but

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.790 
that's the obvious or no entry yes but
haven't<00:04:59.199> played<00:04:59.380> it<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:02.050> doesn't<00:05:02.380> appear<00:05:02.470> to

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
haven't played it it doesn't appear to

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.750 
haven't played it it doesn't appear to
be<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:03.419> horizontal<00:05:04.419> control<00:05:05.280> are<00:05:06.280> they<00:05:06.550> go

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
be a horizontal control are they go

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.300 
be a horizontal control are they go
horizontal<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.139> first<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.770> all<00:05:08.830> which<00:05:09.039> offers

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
horizontal and first of all which offers

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.990 
horizontal and first of all which offers
in<00:05:09.460> means<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.910> changes<00:05:10.240> controls<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
in means it changes controls so the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.320 
in means it changes controls so the
movements<00:05:13.690> make<00:05:14.410> sense<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.610> have<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.849> TV

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
movements make sense and you have the TV

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.230 
movements make sense and you have the TV
side<00:05:16.510> works<00:05:16.810> look<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.919> memory<00:05:18.160> card<00:05:18.370> has<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
side works look the memory card has the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:06:38.930 
side works look the memory card has the
title<00:05:19.810> won<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.080> that's<00:05:20.470> nice

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.240

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
sure if i'm going to be able to get very

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.460 
sure if i'm going to be able to get very
far<00:06:47.820> in<00:06:47.880> it<00:06:48.180> bit<00:06:48.390> my<00:06:48.510> last<00:06:48.780> hope<00:06:48.990> which<00:06:49.200> is<00:06:49.320> why

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
far in it bit my last hope which is why

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.140 
far in it bit my last hope which is why
i<00:06:49.500> haven't<00:06:49.770> reviewed<00:06:50.160> that<00:06:50.400> I'm<00:06:50.820> kind<00:06:51.060> of

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
i haven't reviewed that I'm kind of

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.880 
i haven't reviewed that I'm kind of
hoping<00:06:51.390> that<00:06:51.480> pink<00:06:51.780> bullets<00:06:52.170> is<00:06:52.350> actually

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
hoping that pink bullets is actually

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.260 
hoping that pink bullets is actually
possible<00:06:53.810> because<00:06:54.810> that<00:06:55.200> was<00:06:55.350> rock<00:06:55.560> hard<00:06:55.590> and

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
possible because that was rock hard and

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.850 
possible because that was rock hard and
for<00:06:57.270> my<00:06:57.360> first<00:06:57.540> impressions<00:06:58.050> of<00:06:58.140> this<00:06:58.260> this<00:06:58.650> is

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
for my first impressions of this this is

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.360 
for my first impressions of this this is
as<00:06:59.010> well<00:06:59.250> it's<00:06:59.910> balls<00:07:00.300> hard<00:07:00.780> I<00:07:01.260> can't<00:07:02.250> even

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
as well it's balls hard I can't even

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.310 
as well it's balls hard I can't even
beat<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.610> first<00:07:02.820> level<00:07:02.940> yet<00:07:03.300> but<00:07:03.660> I'll<00:07:04.110> see

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
beat the first level yet but I'll see

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.190 
beat the first level yet but I'll see
how<00:07:04.440> I<00:07:04.500> go<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.100> hopefully<00:07:06.030> in<00:07:06.900> the<00:07:06.960> near

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
how I go and hopefully in the near

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.630 
how I go and hopefully in the near
future<00:07:07.260> I<00:07:07.890> can<00:07:08.310> give<00:07:08.430> you<00:07:08.460> a<00:07:08.760> running<00:07:09.180> to<00:07:09.390> a<00:07:09.480> few
