Sigma 1 50 to 500 HSN rents I also have

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.830 
Sigma 1 50 to 500 HSN rents I also have
here<00:00:34.460> on<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:35.060> here<00:00:35.420> they<00:00:35.750> can<00:00:36.110> 7d<00:00:36.800> and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
here on this one here they can 7d and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.710 
here on this one here they can 7d and
something<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:40.610> should<00:00:40.820> always<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.390> I

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
something that you should always have I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.900 
something that you should always have I
think<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.710> battery<00:00:43.010> grip<00:00:43.309> on<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.579> camera

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
think is a battery grip on the camera

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.209 
think is a battery grip on the camera
because<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:45.170> could<00:00:45.350> be<00:00:45.469> SAT<00:00:45.710> there<00:00:45.949> for<00:00:46.129> hours

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
because you could be SAT there for hours

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.430 
because you could be SAT there for hours
trying<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.000> take<00:00:47.210> different<00:00:47.390> shots<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.079> your

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
trying to take different shots and your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.020 
trying to take different shots and your
battery<00:00:48.829> will<00:00:49.039> run<00:00:49.070> down<00:00:49.460> really<00:00:49.760> quickly

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
battery will run down really quickly

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.599 
battery will run down really quickly

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
especially if you're on silent mode on

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.869 
especially if you're on silent mode on
the<00:00:52.760> camera<00:00:53.410> which<00:00:54.410> is<00:00:54.620> basically<00:00:55.309> live<00:00:55.640> view

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
what I was so I found that especially

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.310 
what I was so I found that especially
small<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.390> was<00:05:23.480> like<00:05:23.630> small<00:05:23.930> birds<00:05:24.170> like

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
small and was like small birds like

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.530 
small and was like small birds like
wrens<00:05:24.620> they<00:05:25.520> were<00:05:25.700> actually<00:05:25.970> coming<00:05:26.120> closer

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
to me which was a surprise because I

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.740 
to me which was a surprise because I
thought<00:05:31.250> maybe<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:31.970> just<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.210> case<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.420> they

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
thought maybe it's just a case of they

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.270 
thought maybe it's just a case of they
wouldn't<00:05:34.150> notice<00:05:35.150> or<00:05:35.600> they<00:05:36.290> wouldn't<00:05:36.530> really

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
wouldn't notice or they wouldn't really

wouldn't notice or they wouldn't really
look<00:05:37.580> at<00:05:37.790> kind<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.090> different<00:05:38.540> plans<00:05:38.720> but<00:05:39.410> they

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
look at kind of different plans but they

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.660

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
do and it's it's well worth getting some

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.280 
do and it's it's well worth getting some

the top just to keep it in place and
stop<00:07:07.360> it<00:07:07.480> from<00:07:07.510> moving<00:07:07.630> but<00:07:08.110> I<00:07:08.800> find<00:07:09.370> that

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
stop it from moving but I find that

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.520 
stop it from moving but I find that
that's<00:07:09.670> that's<00:07:10.240> great<00:07:10.420> for<00:07:10.990> especially<00:07:11.320> if

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
that's that's great for especially if

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.260 
that's that's great for especially if
you've<00:07:11.650> got<00:07:11.800> a<00:07:11.830> pope<00:07:12.100> is<00:07:12.340> through<00:07:12.640> like<00:07:13.000> their

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
you've got a pope is through like their

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.010

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
outside of the trees because you

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.850 
outside of the trees because you
sometimes<00:07:19.270> you<00:07:19.330> do<00:07:19.480> need<00:07:19.630> to<00:07:19.690> get<00:07:19.810> past<00:07:20.020> it<00:07:20.320> and

sometimes you do need to get past it and

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.980 
sometimes you do need to get past it and
hold<00:07:21.700> it<00:07:21.760> out<00:07:21.910> there<00:07:21.970> and<00:07:22.390> that's<00:07:22.720> where<00:07:22.810> your
