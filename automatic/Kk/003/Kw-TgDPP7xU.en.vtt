it's<00:00:36.739> pronounced<00:00:37.040> since<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.460> an<00:00:37.610> acronym

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
it's pronounced since it's an acronym

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.420 
it's pronounced since it's an acronym
for<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:40.269> watch<00:00:41.269> company<00:00:42.229> that<00:00:42.680> specializes

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
for the watch company that specializes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.549 
for the watch company that specializes
in<00:00:43.460> underwater<00:00:44.000> activities<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:45.409> a

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
in underwater activities and so it's a

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.119 
in underwater activities and so it's a
Spanish<00:00:46.070> version<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.519> that<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.799> don't<00:00:49.010> want

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
Spanish version of that and I don't want

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.829 
Spanish version of that and I don't want
to<00:00:49.220> embarrass<00:00:49.430> myself<00:00:49.820> by<00:00:50.210> trying<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.540> say<00:00:50.720> the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
to embarrass myself by trying to say the

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.109 
to embarrass myself by trying to say the
Spanish<00:00:51.049> but<00:00:51.949> that's<00:00:52.220> essentially<00:00:52.820> what<00:00:53.030> they

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
Spanish but that's essentially what they

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.939 
Spanish but that's essentially what they
stand<00:00:53.330> for<00:00:53.479> which<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.080> guess<00:00:54.260> basically<00:00:54.500> means

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
stand for which I guess basically means

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.210 
stand for which I guess basically means
they're<00:00:55.159> specialized<00:00:55.909> dive<00:00:56.180> watch<00:00:56.449> company

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
they're specialized dive watch company

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.590 
they're specialized dive watch company
so<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.250> would<00:00:58.519> make<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:58.850> specialized

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
so that would make this specialized

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.829 
so that would make this specialized
military<00:01:00.229> and<00:01:01.089> tactical<00:01:02.089> dive<00:01:02.239> watch<00:01:02.540> I

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
military and tactical dive watch I

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.950 
military and tactical dive watch I
suppose<00:01:05.229> really<00:01:06.229> really<00:01:06.619> cool<00:01:06.830> watch<00:01:07.869> it's<00:01:08.869> a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
suppose really really cool watch it's a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.410 
suppose really really cool watch it's a
very<00:01:09.200> subtle<00:01:09.759> what<00:01:10.759> makes<00:01:11.000> this<00:01:11.210> watch

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
very subtle what makes this watch

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.039 
very subtle what makes this watch
special<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.259> think<00:01:12.909> when<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.090> look<00:01:14.240> at<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.750> a

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
special I think when you look at it in a

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.080 
special I think when you look at it in a
lot<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.320> ways<00:01:15.439> it<00:01:15.649> just<00:01:15.829> looks<00:01:16.039> like<00:01:16.189> another

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
lot of ways it just looks like another

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.069 
lot of ways it just looks like another
you<00:01:17.689> know<00:01:17.810> sort<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.259> antique<00:01:19.189> gloom<00:01:20.079> dive

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
you know sort of antique gloom dive

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.319 
you know sort of antique gloom dive
watch<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:22.039> know<00:01:22.159> 42<00:01:22.969> mils<00:01:23.289> very<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:25.329> standard

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
watch you know 42 mils very a standard

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.679 
watch you know 42 mils very a standard
kind<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.719> a<00:01:26.899> spec<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.920> but<00:01:28.299> when<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.450> really

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
kind of a spec to it but when you really

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.919 
kind of a spec to it but when you really
get<00:01:30.049> up<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.499> close<00:01:30.679> with<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:32.090> kind<00:01:32.810> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.400 
probably because the case is why but the
bezels<00:02:24.250> will<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.490> narrower<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.050> think<00:02:26.350> it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
bezels will the narrower but I think it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
bezels will the narrower but I think it
wears<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:26.800> great<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:27.880> quite<00:02:28.240> like

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
wears really great actually quite like

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.950 
wears really great actually quite like
the<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.140> size<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.000> feel

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
the the size of it really like the feel

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.080 
the the size of it really like the feel
of<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.380> bracelet<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> bit<00:02:33.460> wider<00:02:34.920> but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
of it the bracelet is a bit wider but

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640 
of it the bracelet is a bit wider but
still<00:02:37.090> wears<00:02:37.270> pretty<00:02:37.510> good<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.200> quite<00:02:38.440> like

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
still wears pretty good and I quite like

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.290 
still wears pretty good and I quite like
it<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:41.050> one<00:02:41.770> thing<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> wish<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.060> didn't

have was these hollow end links I wish

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.610 
have was these hollow end links I wish
it's<00:02:45.490> all<00:02:45.640> end<00:02:45.940> links<00:02:46.180> reminds<00:02:47.110> me<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.500> old

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620

watches but at this price point it would

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.260 
watches but at this price point it would
have<00:02:52.480> hoped<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.990> have<00:02:53.050> sought<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.470> links<00:02:54.010> a

have hoped to have sought in links a

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.570 
have hoped to have sought in links a
nice<00:02:55.270> little<00:02:55.950> engraving<00:02:56.950> there<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> back

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
nice little engraving there in the back

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.860 
nice little engraving there in the back
and<00:02:59.280> a<00:03:00.280> friend<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.060> mine<00:03:01.120> mentioned<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.750> it

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
and a friend of mine mentioned that it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
and a friend of mine mentioned that it
rise<00:03:02.080> above<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.680> see<00:03:02.980> master<00:03:03.480> engraved<00:03:04.480> backs

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
rise above the see master engraved backs

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.860 
rise above the see master engraved backs
it's<00:03:05.920> with<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> medallion<00:03:07.270> thing<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.780> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
it's with the medallion thing in the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.960 
it's with the medallion thing in the
middle<00:03:08.050> there<00:03:08.260> with<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.470> logo<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:09.040> think

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
middle there with the logo I think

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.400 
middle there with the logo I think
that's<00:03:10.120> pretty<00:03:10.270> cool

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
that's pretty cool

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.550 
that's pretty cool
sapphire<00:03:12.370> crystal<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.810> thing<00:03:13.990> is<00:03:14.110> good<00:03:14.320> to

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
sapphire crystal this thing is good to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.300 
sapphire crystal this thing is good to
500<00:03:15.340> meters<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.240> it's<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.780> real<00:03:17.500> bona<00:03:17.770> fide<00:03:18.040> dive

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
500 meters so it's a real bona fide dive

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.000 
500 meters so it's a real bona fide dive
watch<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.970> sense<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.990> bezel<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.440> really

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
watch in that sense the bezel is really

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.530 
watch in that sense the bezel is really
cool<00:03:21.280> because<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.580> actually<00:03:21.700> comes<00:03:22.060> out<00:03:22.330> it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
cool because it actually comes out it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.820 
cool because it actually comes out it
flares<00:03:22.810> out<00:03:23.020> if<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:23.920> see<00:03:24.190> there<00:03:25.680> same<00:03:26.680> let

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
flares out if you can see there same let

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.200 
flares out if you can see there same let
me<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.100> little<00:03:27.220> bit<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.580> better<00:03:27.730> look<00:03:28.000> so

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
me get a little bit of a better look so

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.960 
me get a little bit of a better look so
it<00:03:28.390> flares<00:03:28.870> out<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.890> alternates<00:03:30.280> polished

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
it flares out and it alternates polished

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.210 
it flares out and it alternates polished
and<00:03:31.440> blasted<00:03:32.440> there<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.410> knobs<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.950> nibs

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
and blasted there on the knobs and nibs

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.170 
and blasted there on the knobs and nibs
and<00:03:37.110> take<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.260> Loom<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.610> bezel<00:03:39.820> as

and take the Loom on the on the bezel as

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.510 
and take the Loom on the on the bezel as
well<00:03:40.420> as<00:03:40.540> inside<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.740> all<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:41.950> yellow<00:03:42.220> stuff

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
well as inside so all the yellow stuff

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.940 
well as inside so all the yellow stuff
here<00:03:42.790> glows<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.570> all<00:03:44.350> these<00:03:44.470> yellow<00:03:44.650> stuff

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
here glows and all these yellow stuff

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.200 
here glows and all these yellow stuff
here<00:03:45.160> glows<00:03:46.590> 120<00:03:47.590> quick<00:03:47.800> bezel<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:48.760> it's

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
here glows 120 quick bezel it's it's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.610 
here glows 120 quick bezel it's it's
actually<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.630> little<00:03:49.810> hard<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.200> turn<00:03:52.080> but<00:03:53.080> I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
actually a little hard to turn but I

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.890 
actually a little hard to turn but I
mean<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.100> can<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.490> going<00:03:54.520> but<00:03:55.510> that's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
mean you can get it going but that's

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.750 
mean you can get it going but that's
probably<00:03:56.050> okay<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.130> you're<00:03:57.640> not

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
probably okay because you you're not

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000 
probably okay because you you're not
going<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.000> accidentally<00:03:58.390> turn<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.780> then<00:03:59.010> but

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
going to accidentally turn it then but

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.740 
going to accidentally turn it then but
it's<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.030> grip<00:04:01.240> it<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:01.660> have

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's it's you can grip it you just have

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.800 
it's it's you can grip it you just have
to<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.440> push<00:04:02.740> at<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.270> screwed<00:04:04.270> out<00:04:04.420> crown

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
to really push at it screwed out crown

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.280 
to really push at it screwed out crown
with<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:06.660> side<00:04:07.660> logo<00:04:08.050> there<00:04:09.420> hands<00:04:10.420> are<00:04:10.540> not

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
with the side logo there hands are not

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.330 
with the side logo there hands are not
super<00:04:11.860> big<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.870> little<00:04:14.470> harder<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.070> see

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
super big and do a little harder to see

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.449 
super big and do a little harder to see
then<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:16.450> most<00:04:17.020> I've<00:04:17.320> watches<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.070> because

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
then the most I've watches but because

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.580 
then the most I've watches but because
of<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.700> loom<00:04:19.000> on<00:04:19.720> there<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.169> actually<00:04:20.470> could

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
of that loom on there you actually could

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.310 
of that loom on there you actually could
notice<00:04:20.830> I'm<00:04:20.950> quite<00:04:21.160> easily<00:04:21.419> but<00:04:22.419> very

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
notice I'm quite easily but very

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.890 
notice I'm quite easily but very
looking<00:04:23.710> down<00:04:23.890> I<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> large<00:04:24.900> indexes

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
looking down I like the large indexes

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.700 
looking down I like the large indexes
around<00:04:26.200> there<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:27.660> cases<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.320> really

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
around there and cases just it's really

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.580 
around there and cases just it's really
cool<00:04:29.950> case<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.900> little<00:04:31.900> bit<00:04:32.140> polished

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
cool case a little bit polished

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.220 
cool case a little bit polished
accenting<00:04:33.160> here<00:04:33.310> but<00:04:33.490> like<00:04:34.270> just<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:35.020> way

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
accenting here but like just the way
