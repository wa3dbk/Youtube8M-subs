00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
four in that spot am I going to move

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.360 
four in that spot am I going to move
this<00:00:50.370> ten<00:00:50.670> thousands<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this ten thousands up or is it going to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.930 
this ten thousands up or is it going to
stay<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.910> same<00:00:55.129> it's<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> stay<00:00:56.730> the

a zero only the numbers to the right to
become<00:01:03.000> zero<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> write<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
become zero I'm going to write that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.170 
become zero I'm going to write that
right<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> star<00:01:08.090> only<00:01:11.720> the

right over here with the star only the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.600 
right over here with the star only the
numbers<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.750> mean<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> pound<00:01:17.040> sign<00:01:17.340> for

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
numbers I mean use a pound sign for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
numbers I mean use a pound sign for
numbers<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:23.540> right<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:48.010 

the<00:01:33.980> underlined<00:01:41.479> become<00:01:42.479> zero

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.130 

okay<00:01:49.020> these<00:01:49.800> numbers<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.550> left<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:51.720> stay

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
okay these numbers to the left they stay

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.870 
okay these numbers to the left they stay
what<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.940> what<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:57.170> 500

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
what they are so what I have now is 500

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.930 
what they are so what I have now is 500
and<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:01.140> were<00:02:01.650> told<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.340> underlined

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
and we were told that this underlined

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.700 
and we were told that this underlined
number<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> stay<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.050> same<00:02:04.080> because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
number is going to stay the same because

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
number is going to stay the same because
this<00:02:04.920> one's<00:02:05.100> only<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> four<00:02:08.540> 580,000<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.690> these

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this one's only a four 580,000 and these

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.729 
this one's only a four 580,000 and these
are<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> become<00:02:10.380> zeros<00:02:15.739> that's

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
are all going to become zeros that's

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.930 
are all going to become zeros that's
what<00:02:16.980> happens<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> round<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> nearest

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
what happens when I round to the nearest

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.920 
what happens when I round to the nearest
10,000<00:02:20.940> okay

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
10,000 okay

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.890 
10,000 okay
let's<00:02:22.770> try<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.300> let's<00:02:24.300> try<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.660> more

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
let's try one more let's try it one more

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:39.880 
let's try one more let's try it one more
um<00:02:25.680> how<00:02:26.610> about<00:02:32.030> 1<00:02:33.030> million<00:02:34.459> four<00:02:35.459> hundred

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.820 

seventy-nine<00:02:41.209> thousand<00:02:42.830> two<00:02:43.830> hundred

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
seventy-nine thousand two hundred

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:55.170 
seventy-nine thousand two hundred
sixty-three

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.420 

which<00:02:56.180> number<00:02:56.780> which<00:02:57.110> place<00:02:57.590> value<00:02:58.130> am<00:02:58.280> I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
which number which place value am I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.980 
which number which place value am I
going<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.700> round<00:02:58.940> to<00:03:02.530> simian<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.720> place

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
going to round to simian but what place

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.370 
going to round to simian but what place
value<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:09.550> Logan<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:11.540> hundreds<00:03:12.110> place

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
value is that Logan the hundreds place

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.979 
value is that Logan the hundreds place
yeah<00:03:12.650> which<00:03:13.069> is<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.430> two<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.940> case<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:14.930> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
yeah which is the two in this case now I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.260 
yeah which is the two in this case now I
have<00:03:15.500> two<00:03:15.770> i've<00:03:16.100> already<00:03:16.340> underlined<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.090> i

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
have two i've already underlined it i

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.240 
have two i've already underlined it i
have<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:17.989> look<00:03:18.440> at<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.890> number<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> right

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
have to look at the number to the right

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.420 
have to look at the number to the right
it's<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.910> six<00:03:23.330> am<00:03:23.750> i<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.980> move<00:03:25.220> that

the numbers after the underline we're

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.710 
the numbers after the underline we're
going<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.730> make<00:03:52.880> those<00:03:53.090> zero<00:03:53.450> because

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
going to make those zero because

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.080 
going to make those zero because
remember<00:03:53.750> only<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.100> numbers<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.880> right

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
remember only the numbers to the right

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.569 
remember only the numbers to the right
of<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.540> underline<00:03:57.079> becomes<00:03:57.560> zero<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.100> I'm

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
of the underline becomes zero so I'm

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.150 
of the underline becomes zero so I'm
left<00:03:58.910> with<00:03:59.180> 1<00:04:00.079> million<00:04:01.209> four<00:04:02.620> thousand<00:04:03.620> or

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
left with 1 million four thousand or
