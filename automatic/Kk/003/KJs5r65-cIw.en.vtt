 time watching you on television but not

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.750
 when you do that little worm of 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.810
 television is emotional in the cart 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.520

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.780
 I was rolling programs today I worked 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.800
 on the part of the channel his missionary work 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.479

 for crying from porvera tv also that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.930

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 work 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.720
 then then I went to tele media 25 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:38.360
 where I was with friends months 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.550

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.070
 brother his half of the night by 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.600
 issues of the schedule I had to stop 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.340
 work as a medium was really a 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.930
 person that I love very much and still 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.729
 We have good friendship relationship and 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.160
 I was also with Daniel Marcelo Saturday 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.730
 so 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.670
 from another communicator daniel martÃ­n who 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.610
 has the same profile so the wood that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.770
 you have to work that name because you do not 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.330
 they upload me to the first one I know at 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.490
 bastion of the afternoon what is called a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.670
 I know little Carlos and Sanchez what 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:19.130
 I know everything really good when 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.110
 you arrive to the capital formally enters 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.150
 to take advantage of the left does not enter 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.580
 directly the program review already 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.580
 gives the opportunity to enter the part 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.190
 Press the group and group Telemicro 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm going to do an internship and in the area of 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.820
 press then I know charly in a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.530
 given time I will cover a news 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.530
 get very colorful 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.560
 i 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.080
 it does not work anywhere 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.300
 the relationship better on a test will 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.150
 talking to the medium no no no you are not going to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.730
 present and then I started to present 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.220
 and I already have some time with him perfect 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.050
 there are many communicators who have said that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.799
 It is not easy to earn a space in the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.640
 medium because to young women and 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.250
 elegant 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 often fall in love in your case that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.090
 has happened with that look you have to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.940
 have your feet on the ground and is that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.920
 when you get to media where there 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.540
 So many people are obviously going to 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.940
 appear those who fall in love you must 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 know that you're going to fall in love obviously 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.989
 Every woman who uses a lot of makeup 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.610
 that is always well-groomed is going to 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.110
 have men approaching productions 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.390
 that is clear with what you are looking for 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.099
 is another thing now well as wendy said 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.959
 right now what you never that money and 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.360
 another thing obviously you go by 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.730
 that line immediately but in my case 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.110
 has been understand that not so difficult 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.560
 because from the beginning I arrived with 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:58.350
 the clear north of what I want 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.000
 although he is already used to driving in 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.100
 case of fighting and not because it stays very 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.950
 serious that respects a lot is real is my 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.780
 brother is not my friend we only have 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.390
 a friendship relationship is therefore very 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.240
 good among all there and to me has not 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.709
 touched the part of agramonte that root 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.540
 of what happened with her came out of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.370
 program because decided as a 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 kind of sabbatical media year 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.810
 you were in the program clearly yes with 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 Angie, I can not say we were friends 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.220
 we never get along very well with people and 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.680
 people are still in the air for attention 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.600
 cachiche points with says of her that they have 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.870
 monde reach the commanding silence which 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 you're like when you get to play 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.840
 maybe maybe more women sometimes than 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.750
 we feel that someone is coming to remove 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.550
 our 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.849
 What could be insecurity of mood? 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.440
 fear I do not know I understand that I arrived 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.690
 to do my job and if she does not 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.400
 liked my participation she felt that 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.310
 it was also an opportunity to talk 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 I do not know that was what made certain 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.159
 things happen but going back to the subject of what 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.050
 what happened to her when she is already seen 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.550
 the programmatic was not happy me in 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.590
 no time when as I said no 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.900
 never but you called it the success that 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.360
 I was sorry not for even smsem question 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 or some means of communication and I 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.330
 I spoke in favor of her because it is that 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.330
 many enemy women 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:33.240
 there was not talk about something is pretty the 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.159
 makeup and that kind of thing but 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.569
 never ever a relationship for example with 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.889
 my other partner and compares it to 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.940
 ten thousand that star we have a 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.770
 very close relationship 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.900
 but with it we never went energy 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.210
 so when that happened, I 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.530
 I was very sorry and has a daughter people 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.940
 He talked a lot without knowing also the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.370
 dependence this moment because the 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.540
 people thought too much about this 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.430
 case without having 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.590
 you think that by the way he tells me that 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.820
 you listened to wendy vargas that in the 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.770
 half of many women who are 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:05.470
 looking at the protocol does some 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.470
 if you laugh because probably if you laugh 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.489
 with this the immediate plans and you say 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.049
 the plans and media now returns to the 

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:13.809
 entrance of the new season that the 

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:15.429
 thing that starts the past and that consists 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:16.539
 that new season look we're going to 

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:18.609
 greatly strengthen what is production 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.109
 if you need it you do not need that to 

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:22.389
 lower the production point if not 

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:27.039
 need change want now if what 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.329
 I need and so many positive things 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.819
 who are coming for the program we are 

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:34.109
 working on this comes a lot 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.109

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.399
 made and spend the capital in the area of 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.749
 press specifically that is, it was not 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.759
