00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:10.220
 Yes, we assemble the lobby is also very much is happy to this time this time 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.030
 It is Robi 22 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.380
 Yes, I 'm immediately introduced from the introduction of Perth 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.130
 Then we will introduce the parts used in the Roby 22 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.430
 At first the left bolly cover servo 4 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.570
 m 24.5 3 pieces Miri pan screws 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 Servo cable 200mm major love and 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 Assembled with the left arm No. 21 assembled in No. 20 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.500
 It is standing with the seal provided by servo motor 35. Then I want to make it pile 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.620
 I think you 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.090
 The first step is to poll the left arm 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.930
 First of all, bend your left arm 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.560
 In this way 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 Hmm 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:02.790
 Yes If this is the case, this hole on the left body cover will be servo system 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 I'll touch it here and install it so it can go in 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.710
 One put the plane 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.780
 Once inside of Saab type block 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.520
 Yes 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.850
 I about amazing how much Nde not stopped Well this is also what I am such state Looking at the back 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.759
 But let's leave this around here 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.700
 Once this is done , attach the serve phone to the shaft of the turbo motor. 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.770
 Because there is a table, let's be careful a little 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.140
 The small side is called this d-cut 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.679
 As d cut comes on the front side there is a place where cormorants have become It is straight 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.679
 Mounting also 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 Hmm 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.350
 I am 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.440
 Yes I was choreographed 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:01.570
 It will go to the next process 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 Next will present the servo and left arm yes yes 2 of this servo motor open this 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.560
 Yes i took it off 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.910
 Yes i started 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.590
 If you remove this and then remove the cover 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.220
 Maiden 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.220
 Right now 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.670
 Boo Boo 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.670
 The Ruru servo system that is out of this left body cover 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.860
 It is the connector that is open 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.820
 Connect to the vacant connector 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.820
 In or let's go up to a little 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 This electrolytic moko was very difficult 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.610
 Well 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.410
 Hmm 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.300
 def 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 Yes I was able to install it somehow Yes 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.350
 Look high 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.410
 Let's confirm that the police department is not floating Next , this agai cable this winter 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.070
 Part of a tree 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.210
 I have a respirator, but I do not bite with the groove so that the cable can go in the part of this cutout 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.240
 This in 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.480
 This is a servo motor while 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.060
 Accumulate 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:24.040
 Yes in this condition there is a box- shaped connecting bracket and this of the surf horn 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.040
 Stop the screw here with a screw hole 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.420
 Yes screw finished 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:43.040
 Next is 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.830
 There is a panel, but I remove the panel 11 times 9 days 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.930
 Ah 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.680
 Remove this lid from the panel 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.860
 Here we extend the cable of de way panel 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.160
 The cable here is passing through this just 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:03.590
 I'm connected to the servo motor, but if the 9 cable 5 is loose then something is wrong 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.550
 I pull from here once that it is easy to get up 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.470
 Yes 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:15.760
 It comes out full To Kondake excess cable 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.760
 It is that previously achieved this in this man panel Love 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.120
 I will stop here when I put it in again 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.590
 Haon 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.770
 U 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.529

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.889
 Phoenix 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.889
 Contact Wow over 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.849
 Yes trends 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:46.959
 Way along the wind tunnel 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.959
 Finally, tighten this unscrewed screw 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 Hmm 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.570
 Ah 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:09.900
 Yes this is the end of assembly 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:17.090
 I really want to cut this servo motor protection seal fani this time 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.090
 Here you can also a little right body to say that the left arm left body 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.440
 Yes this is right body here left body 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.270
 I can not come anywhere 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.780
 Something like this 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.050
 It feels like the arms are finally made 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.100
 Obviously the length of Stockhausen servo cable 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.700
 On? Such of it is the difference between you I both high 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.639
 Conversation Oh 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.920
 It is said that such a thin rodi 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.060
 Then 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.060
 I can not say why 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:06:02.740
 It has gradually been presented Yes notification Now the assembly of the lobby No. 22 is finished From the next time 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:05.190
 It 's about the lower shields, so look forward to it again next time 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.190
 Bye 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.650
