00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
my friend some of my subscribers so this

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.280 
my friend some of my subscribers so this
time<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.520> cave<00:00:05.759> system<00:00:06.290> which

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
time we talk about the cave system which

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
time we talk about the cave system which
basically<00:00:08.099> means<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> open

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
basically means that in the open

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.269 
basically means that in the open
position<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.490> hold<00:00:12.799> this<00:00:13.799> course<00:00:14.490> see<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
position you can hold this course see a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
position you can hold this course see a
GED<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:18.500> major<00:00:19.500> way<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.240> cases<00:00:21.510> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
GED in major way and in some cases in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.710 
GED in major way and in some cases in
the<00:00:22.080> mind<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.439> minor<00:00:22.710> way<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.449> use

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the mind of minor way and if you use

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
the mind of minor way and if you use
this<00:00:26.090> position<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.660> fingering<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:29.039> push

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this position of fingering you can push

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
this position of fingering you can push
it<00:00:29.460> forward<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> neck<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:31.050> hold

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it forward in the neck and you can hold

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
it forward in the neck and you can hold
all<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.830> major<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.489> other<00:00:32.700> minor<00:00:32.969> scales

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
all the major and other minor scales

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.549 
all the major and other minor scales
through<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> whole<00:00:35.969> neck<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.559> fretboard

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
through the whole neck or the fretboard

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
through the whole neck or the fretboard
so<00:00:39.920> basically<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> open

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so basically the these are the open

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.330 
so basically the these are the open
chords<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.860> major<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> minor<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.469> C

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
chords of major and minor and this is C

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.229 
chords of major and minor and this is C
major<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.629> convert<00:00:49.079> C<00:00:49.410> major<00:00:49.760> but<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.059> not

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
major in convert C major but it's not

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.170 
major in convert C major but it's not
possible<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> hold<00:00:52.170> C<00:00:52.829> minor<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.850> open

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
possible to hold C minor in an open

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
possible to hold C minor in an open
position<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.340> after<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:57.590> major<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
position and after a major and you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.780 
position and after a major and you can
want

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.600 

completion<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.890> after<00:01:05.550> G<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.250> want

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
completion and after G you can only want

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.440 
completion and after G you can only want
G<00:01:09.980> major<00:01:10.980> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> open<00:01:11.790> position<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.540> after<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
G major in the open position and after a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:28.070 
G major in the open position and after a
so<00:01:15.450> image<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.550> can<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.600> hold

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so image and so what you can do to hold

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.680 
so image and so what you can do to hold
you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.590> hold<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.670> other<00:01:29.820> major<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
you can hold all the other major and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.990 
you can hold all the other major and
minor<00:01:31.020> chords<00:01:31.410> using<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.870> shapes<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:35.190> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
minor chords using these shapes so but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
minor chords using these shapes so but
then<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.590> Barre<00:01:38.369> chord<00:01:38.820> which

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
then you have to use Barre chord which

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.310 
then you have to use Barre chord which
is<00:01:39.150> basically<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.020> part<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:41.780> basically<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is basically this part so basically this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
is basically this part so basically this
is<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:44.690> minor<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.410> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.250> push<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.729> forward<00:01:49.340> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is a minor and if you push it forward it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.850 
is a minor and if you push it forward it
becomes<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:51.590> sharp<00:01:52.590> minor

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.670 

and<00:02:01.300> also<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:02.960> do<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.680> same<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:05.680> all

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
and also you can do the same with all

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.350 
and also you can do the same with all
the<00:02:06.800> others<00:02:07.130> but<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.090> most<00:02:08.300> common<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:10.790> do<00:02:10.940> is

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
the others but the most common to do is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.680 
the others but the most common to do is
with<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.230> shape<00:02:12.770> or<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.490> shape<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.510> with

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
with the a shape or the a shape so with

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.620 
with the a shape or the a shape so with
the<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.960> shape<00:02:15.320> like<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.190> example<00:02:16.280> easy<00:02:16.760> major

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the a shape like for example easy major

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the a shape like for example easy major
you<00:02:18.500> push<00:02:18.890> forward<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.510> becomes<00:02:20.930> F<00:02:21.320> major

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you push forward and it becomes F major

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.340 
you push forward and it becomes F major
G<00:02:24.650> major<00:02:25.150> G<00:02:26.150> major<00:02:26.410> E<00:02:27.730> major

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
G major G major E major

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.370 
G major G major E major
so<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.650> can<00:02:31.270> calculate<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.140> can

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
so you can calculate this and you can

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.750 
so you can calculate this and you can
use<00:02:33.560> all<00:02:33.920> these<00:02:34.190> positions<00:02:34.790> sometimes<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.690> used

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.910 

positioners<00:02:40.659> for<00:02:41.260> example<00:02:41.769> would<00:02:42.129> F<00:02:42.459> major

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
positioners for example would F major

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:54.000 
positioners for example would F major
because<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:52.030> basically<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:53.470> this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
because what I like basically in this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.610 
because what I like basically in this
system<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:57.040> play<00:02:57.610> along<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:59.290> chord

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
system that you can play along one chord

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.710 
system that you can play along one chord
with<00:02:59.860> another<00:03:00.129> if<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.519> know<00:03:00.849> where<00:03:01.450> they<00:03:01.690> are

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
with another if you know where they are

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.890 
with another if you know where they are
so<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.819> sounds<00:03:04.209> amazing

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
so and it sounds amazing

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.000 
so and it sounds amazing
so<00:03:05.739> for<00:03:06.099> example<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.909> can<00:03:07.120> hold<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:08.140> minor

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
so for example you can hold the a minor

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.339 
so for example you can hold the a minor
here<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:10.959> also<00:03:11.200> hold<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.620> here

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.830 

so<00:03:17.349> all<00:03:17.709> these<00:03:17.950> chords<00:03:18.430> together<00:03:18.629> sounds<00:03:19.629> very

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
so all these chords together sounds very

00:03:19.840 --> 00:04:01.420 
so all these chords together sounds very
nice<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.379> can<00:03:20.680> show<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.010> this

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.000 

so<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.939> can<00:04:03.920> try<00:04:04.920> over<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.730> find<00:04:06.090> all<00:04:06.510> these

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
so you can try over and find all these

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.530 
so you can try over and find all these
things<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.879> play<00:04:09.629> some<00:04:10.519> some<00:04:11.519> chords<00:04:11.969> on

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
things and just play some some chords on

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.619 
things and just play some some chords on
the<00:04:12.599> other<00:04:12.989> chord<00:04:13.439> and<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.489> will<00:04:14.700> find<00:04:15.180> some

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
the other chord and you will find some
