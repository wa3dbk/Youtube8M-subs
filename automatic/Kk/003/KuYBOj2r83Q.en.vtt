tablets<00:00:14.130> into<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> dash<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.820> their<00:00:14.940> cars<00:00:15.179> and

Cabot<00:00:18.210> tablet<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.840> figured<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> heck<00:00:19.500> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
Cabot tablet I figured what the heck I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.560 
Cabot tablet I figured what the heck I
might<00:00:19.770> as<00:00:19.859> well<00:00:19.890> try<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.910> ordered<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:21.390> up

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
might as well try it so I ordered one up

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.429 
might as well try it so I ordered one up
it's<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.109> -<00:00:22.289> 7<00:00:22.619> inch<00:00:22.800> Android<00:00:23.250> tablet<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's here - 7 inch Android tablet and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
it's here - 7 inch Android tablet and
originally<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> had<00:00:25.560> intention<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> putting<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
originally I had intention of putting it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320 
originally I had intention of putting it
into<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.660> dash<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.029> would<00:00:30.300> have

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
into the dash here but that would have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
into the dash here but that would have
meant<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.960> move<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> switches<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.070> move<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
meant to move the switches down move the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
meant to move the switches down move the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
radio to the glovebox or get a different

head unit grind out or put some type of
frame<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:43.020> columns<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
frame in to the side columns here so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
frame in to the side columns here so
that<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> would<00:00:44.040> hold<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.840> would

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that it would hold it and that would

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
that it would hold it and that would
have<00:00:46.110> been<00:00:46.200> okay<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.340> radio<00:00:48.300> itself<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
have been okay but the radio itself I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.630 
have been okay but the radio itself I
don't<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.950> hate<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> radio<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

source channel changes and so forth and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
source channel changes and so forth and
that<00:01:16.950> module<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.490> had<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> wire<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.689> wire<00:01:18.960> at

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that module I had a wire in one wire at

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
that module I had a wire in one wire at
a<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> real<00:01:20.759> pain<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.110> move

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a time which was a real pain so to move

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
a time which was a real pain so to move
all<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> glovebox<00:01:23.460> would<00:01:23.939> have

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
all of that to the glovebox would have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
all of that to the glovebox would have
been<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> hassle<00:01:24.740> plus<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.070> would<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
been a hassle plus that would have

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
been a hassle plus that would have
locked<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:26.729> into<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> particular<00:01:27.630> tablet

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
locked me into this particular tablet

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
locked me into this particular tablet
where<00:01:28.650> maybe<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> tablet<00:01:29.790> broke<00:01:30.180> I'd<00:01:30.479> have

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
where maybe if the tablet broke I'd have

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
where maybe if the tablet broke I'd have
to<00:01:30.990> find<00:01:31.200> exactly<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> same<00:01:32.040> size<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to find exactly the same size or I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.749 
to find exactly the same size or I
couldn't<00:01:33.540> switch<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.369> had<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> for

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
couldn't switch it out if I had to for

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.710 
couldn't switch it out if I had to for
whatever<00:01:35.909> reason<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.159> these<00:01:38.720> really

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
whatever reason so all of these really

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
whatever reason so all of these really
kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> pushed<00:01:40.259> me<00:01:40.320> away<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.770> those<00:01:40.979> reasons

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
kind of pushed me away all those reasons

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
kind of pushed me away all those reasons
pushed<00:01:41.520> me<00:01:41.640> away<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:41.909> installing<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
pushed me away from installing into the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
pushed me away from installing into the
dash<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> came<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
dash so what I came up with was this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
dash so what I came up with was this
this<00:01:44.759> hinged<00:01:45.299> approach<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.740> see

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this hinged approach and you can see

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.469 
this hinged approach and you can see
there's<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.250> actual<00:01:47.549> hinge<00:01:47.970> along<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
there's an actual hinge along the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's an actual hinge along the
backside<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> get

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
backside here and when I need to get

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
backside here and when I need to get
access<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> heater<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.710> AC<00:01:52.890> controls<00:01:53.520> or

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
access to the heater or AC controls or

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
access to the heater or AC controls or
to<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.360> radio<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> lift

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to the radio there I just have to lift

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670 
to the radio there I just have to lift
it<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.420> access<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.960> those<00:01:58.200> items

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it up and I have access to those items

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
it up and I have access to those items
like<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.299> leave<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
like or when I'm not I just leave it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
like or when I'm not I just leave it
down<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> still<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.829> access<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.219> my

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
down and I still have access to my

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
down and I still have access to my
switches<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.000> easy<00:02:03.270> access<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.680> don't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
switches so easy access is there I don't

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
switches so easy access is there I don't
really<00:02:05.640> touch<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.810> radio<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.979> change

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
really touch the radio a lot to change

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.650 
really touch the radio a lot to change
stations<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> steering

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
stations I can do that on the steering

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.980 
stations I can do that on the steering
wheel<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> volume<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:10.920> forth

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
wheel with the volume and so forth

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.070 
wheel with the volume and so forth
listen<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.380> XM<00:02:12.950> radio<00:02:13.310> Sirius<00:02:13.640> XM<00:02:13.970> radio<00:02:14.300> so

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
listen to XM radio Sirius XM radio so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.930 
listen to XM radio Sirius XM radio so
this<00:02:15.260> gave<00:02:15.470> me<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.680> pretty<00:02:16.100> good<00:02:16.280> option<00:02:16.490> here

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this gave me a pretty good option here

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.530 
this gave me a pretty good option here
the<00:02:17.710> interesting<00:02:18.710> part<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.180> what<00:02:20.180> did<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.360> use

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the interesting part is what did I use

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.440 
the interesting part is what did I use
for<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:20.930> hinge<00:02:21.500> well<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.430> hinge<00:02:22.790> started

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
for this hinge well that hinge started

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.850 
for this hinge well that hinge started
as<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:24.100> box<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.990> nuttin<00:02:26.990> bolt<00:02:27.230> box<00:02:27.560> from

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
as a box that was a nuttin bolt box from

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
as a box that was a nuttin bolt box from
a<00:02:28.130> toolkit<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.600> can<00:02:29.750> see<00:02:29.930> here's<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.260> box

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
a toolkit you can see here's the box

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.170 
a toolkit you can see here's the box
here's<00:02:30.830> an<00:02:30.950> example<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.550> box<00:02:31.820> there's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
here's an example of that box there's

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.040 
here's an example of that box there's
the<00:02:32.300> inside<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.970> along<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.600> backside

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the inside right along the backside

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.630 
the inside right along the backside
you'll<00:02:36.350> notice<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> hinge<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> nice

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
you'll notice that the hinge is a nice

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.150 
you'll notice that the hinge is a nice
long<00:02:37.910> hinge<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.600> box<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> fairly<00:02:39.470> thin

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
long hinge and the box is a fairly thin

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.520 
long hinge and the box is a fairly thin
metal<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:40.850> fairly<00:02:41.180> strong<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.170> this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
metal but it's fairly strong so this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.980 
metal but it's fairly strong so this
really<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.160> what<00:02:43.790> started<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> whole<00:02:44.480> process

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
really is what started the whole process

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.930 
really is what started the whole process
here<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> had<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.040> cut<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.820> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
here all I had to do is cut it to the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.640 
here all I had to do is cut it to the
size<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.480> want

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
size that I want

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.130 
size that I want
you<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.730> file<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.210> grind<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.570> down<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.020> it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
you know file it grind it down so it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.420 
you know file it grind it down so it
didn't<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.440> any<00:02:51.560> sharp<00:02:51.860> edges<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.280> actually

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
didn't have any sharp edges I actually

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550 
didn't have any sharp edges I actually
put<00:02:52.790> some<00:02:52.820> paint<00:02:53.210> on<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.450> because<00:02:54.080> there<00:02:54.470> were

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
put some paint on it because there were

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.280 
put some paint on it because there were
some<00:02:54.770> scratches<00:02:55.310> along<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.330> way<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.020> ended

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
some scratches along the way and I ended

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.900 
some scratches along the way and I ended
up<00:02:57.380> with<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.680> particular<00:02:57.920> hinge<00:02:58.670> mechanism

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
up with this particular hinge mechanism

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.240 
up with this particular hinge mechanism
I<00:02:59.390> have<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.570> little<00:02:59.840> slot<00:03:00.110> there<00:03:00.140> for<00:03:00.560> wiring<00:03:01.070> so

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
I have a little slot there for wiring so

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.800 
I have a little slot there for wiring so
that<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.640> run<00:03:01.760> wires<00:03:02.030> if<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.360> ever<00:03:02.480> want<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
that I can run wires if I ever want to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.040 
that I can run wires if I ever want to
run<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.440> connection<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.490> my<00:03:04.670> auxilary<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.600> can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
run a connection for my auxilary I can

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.930 
run a connection for my auxilary I can
put<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> micro<00:03:06.590> SD<00:03:06.920> card<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.340> here<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.670> run<00:03:07.790> my

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
put a micro SD card in here and run my

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.310 
put a micro SD card in here and run my
music<00:03:08.300> off<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.020> run<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.290> through

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
music off of that I can run it through

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.800 
music off of that I can run it through
there<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> lot<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.180> options<00:03:11.690> in<00:03:11.780> that

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
there so I have a lot of options in that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.650 
there so I have a lot of options in that
regard<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.520> pretty<00:03:13.880> nice<00:03:14.090> install

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
regard so this is a pretty nice install

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.030 
regard so this is a pretty nice install
here<00:03:14.960> it's<00:03:15.140> pretty<00:03:15.350> simple<00:03:15.710> straightforward

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
here it's pretty simple straightforward

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.690 
this top part of the bottom part of the
dash<00:03:27.200> at<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.440> top<00:03:27.650> part<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.070> radio<00:03:28.430> in

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
dash at the top part of the radio in

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.520 
dash at the top part of the radio in
fact<00:03:29.240> I<00:03:29.360> thought<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.600> would<00:03:29.780> have<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.960> bolt<00:03:30.320> that

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
fact I thought I would have to bolt that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.800 
fact I thought I would have to bolt that
in<00:03:30.710> but<00:03:31.070> it's<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.640> snug<00:03:31.970> enough<00:03:32.120> fit<00:03:32.480> where<00:03:32.690> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
in but it's a snug enough fit where it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
in but it's a snug enough fit where it
just<00:03:33.020> slides<00:03:33.320> in<00:03:33.590> there<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.280> if<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.430> ever<00:03:34.550> need

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
just slides in there so if I ever need

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.220 
just slides in there so if I ever need
to<00:03:34.910> even<00:03:35.150> remove<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.480> hinge<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.840> don't<00:03:36.020> have<00:03:36.110> to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
to even remove the hinge I don't have to

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.800 
to even remove the hinge I don't have to
disassemble<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.980> entire<00:03:37.010> dash<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.970> could<00:03:38.540> just

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
disassemble the entire dash I could just

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.750 
disassemble the entire dash I could just
pull<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.020> out<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:40.310> seems<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.670> be

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
pull that out so this just seems to be

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.210 
pull that out so this just seems to be
working<00:03:41.090> out<00:03:41.150> pretty<00:03:41.390> well<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.440> if<00:03:42.800> we<00:03:42.860> take<00:03:43.160> a

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
working out pretty well so if we take a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:56.300 
working out pretty well so if we take a
look<00:03:43.430> at<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:45.130> start<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.250> up

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.230 

so<00:03:56.670> we'll<00:03:56.970> turn<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.610> that's<00:03:59.610> -

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
so we'll turn that on and that's -

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.130 
so we'll turn that on and that's -
command<00:04:00.690> software<00:04:02.300> it's<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.540> piece<00:04:04.110> of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
command software it's a piece of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.280 
command software it's a piece of
software<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.740> reads<00:04:05.430> either<00:04:05.959> Wi-Fi<00:04:06.959> or

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
software that reads either Wi-Fi or

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.240 
software that reads either Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth<00:04:07.890> obd<00:04:08.550> module<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:10.010> right<00:04:11.010> now<00:04:11.220> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
Bluetooth obd module and right now I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.040 
Bluetooth obd module and right now I
have<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.700> connected<00:04:11.819> up<00:04:12.240> I<00:04:12.450> actually<00:04:12.630> have<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
have it connected up I actually have the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.080 
have it connected up I actually have the
module<00:04:13.260> we'll<00:04:13.680> see<00:04:13.920> I'll<00:04:14.580> show<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:14.880> now<00:04:15.030> that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
module we'll see I'll show you now that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.770 
module we'll see I'll show you now that
it's<00:04:15.360> running

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.110 

see<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.500> module<00:04:18.920> underneath<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.640> making

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
see the module underneath there making

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.480 
see the module underneath there making
its<00:04:20.269> connection<00:04:20.780> talking<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
its connection talking to the to the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.390 
its connection talking to the to the
tablet

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
tablet

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.450 
tablet
so<00:04:26.639> there's<00:04:27.639> my<00:04:27.790> radio<00:04:28.180> turning<00:04:28.540> on<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.919> have

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so there's my radio turning on so I have

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.170 
so there's my radio turning on so I have
access<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.210> if<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.480> need<00:04:32.310> one<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.520> don't<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:34.000> can

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
access to it if I need one I don't I can

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.020 
access to it if I need one I don't I can
just<00:04:34.389> control<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.169> with<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.440> wheel<00:04:35.970> there's<00:04:36.970> a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
just control it with the wheel there's a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.790 
just control it with the wheel there's a
lot<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.330> really<00:04:37.570> interesting<00:04:37.780> functions<00:04:38.620> with

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
lot of really interesting functions with

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.110 
lot of really interesting functions with
-<00:04:38.979> command<00:04:39.430> if<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.610> haven't<00:04:39.880> seen<00:04:40.000> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
- command if you haven't seen the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.480 
- command if you haven't seen the
software<00:04:40.540> it's<00:04:40.630> pretty<00:04:40.840> cool<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.229> play<00:04:41.350> with

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
software it's pretty cool to play with

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.920 
software it's pretty cool to play with
now<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.639> is<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.940> tenth<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.360> still<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.690> full

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
now it is the tenth this is still a full

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.420 
now it is the tenth this is still a full
tablet<00:04:44.169> so<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.560> don't<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:44.889> have<00:04:45.190> any<00:04:45.370> other

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
tablet so I don't really have any other

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.850 
tablet so I don't really have any other
software<00:04:46.240> on<00:04:46.570> there<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:47.350> right<00:04:47.470> now<00:04:47.530> I'm

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
software on there but for right now I'm

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.710 
software on there but for right now I'm
just<00:04:48.070> running<00:04:48.340> -<00:04:48.520> command<00:04:48.940> I'm<00:04:49.030> sure<00:04:49.419> I'll<00:04:49.540> get

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
just running - command I'm sure I'll get

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.140 
just running - command I'm sure I'll get
GPS<00:04:50.260> software<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:51.040> mapping<00:04:51.400> software<00:04:51.610> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
GPS software and mapping software and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.050 
GPS software and mapping software and
even<00:04:52.300> move<00:04:52.900> my<00:04:53.080> music<00:04:53.470> over<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.860> there<00:04:54.010> but<00:04:54.250> all

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
even move my music over to there but all

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.670 
even move my music over to there but all
I<00:04:55.090> have<00:04:55.479> at<00:04:55.600> this<00:04:55.690> particular<00:04:56.199> point<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:56.530> time

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
I have at this particular point in time

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.730 
I have at this particular point in time
is<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:56.950> -<00:04:57.250> command<00:04:57.669> software<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:59.229> nice<00:04:59.470> thing

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
is the - command software the nice thing

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.200 
is the - command software the nice thing
too<00:04:59.950> that<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.190> did<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:00.729> particular

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.900 
too that I did on this particular
install<00:05:01.900> because<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.979> can<00:05:03.190> slide<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.490> have<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.790> lot

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.550 
install because I can slide I have a lot
of<00:05:04.030> flexibility<00:05:04.660> about<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.960> depth<00:05:05.260> at<00:05:05.500> which

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
of flexibility about the depth at which

is<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> different<00:05:25.630> sized<00:05:25.810> grommet<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.410> put

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
is get a different sized grommet and put

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.040 
is get a different sized grommet and put
it<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.340> there<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.729> can<00:05:27.910> tilt<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:28.570> up<00:05:28.720> I<00:05:28.870> could

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
it in there and I can tilt it up I could

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.659 
it in there and I can tilt it up I could
take<00:05:29.200> you<00:05:29.289> take<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.650> grommet<00:05:30.010> off<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.370> lay<00:05:30.610> it

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
take you take the grommet off and lay it

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.190 
take you take the grommet off and lay it
more<00:05:31.419> flat<00:05:31.690> but<00:05:32.880> that's<00:05:33.880> that's<00:05:34.600> my<00:05:34.750> install

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
more flat but that's that's my install

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.480 
more flat but that's that's my install
hope<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.560> gives<00:05:35.710> some<00:05:35.860> other<00:05:36.010> people<00:05:36.310> some

it's<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.520> nice<00:05:38.669> flexible<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.569> it's<00:05:39.689> not<00:05:39.840> as

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
it's a nice flexible so it's not as

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.279 
it's a nice flexible so it's not as
intrusive<00:05:41.550> as<00:05:41.939> cutting<00:05:42.479> it<00:05:42.569> into<00:05:42.689> the<00:05:42.870> columns

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
intrusive as cutting it into the columns
