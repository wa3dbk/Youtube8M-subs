00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.819
 the information takes us to Canada because 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.300
 there is a whale about to explode 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.269
 vicky if they are the neighbors of troll river 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.959
 in canada this is in newfoundland they have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.380
 panic because there is a one blue whale 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.140
 more than 25 meters long that is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960
 found on the east coasts of this 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.929
 promenade for several days and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.720
 already has double its original size 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.600
 because it has been swollen by gas this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.879
 methane that it carries inside let's say in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 medium to this obviously part of 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.730
 the decomposition is not true of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.760
 corpse of the whale and what could 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.170
 happen is that the whale explodes 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.180
 explode for this methane gas you have in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.890
 its interior that has a smell in addition 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 imaginable unimaginable good the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 question is that in the neighbors of this 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 village that has 600 inhabitants and does not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.519
 you have too many financial resources 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 asks the federal government to do something 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.710
 that intervention does not want it either 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 again at sea because of a danger that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 could mean for fishermen that 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.649
 they circulate in the good coasts the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 question is who says that position and the 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.080
 government there from Newfoundland nor did 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210
 the federal authorities the neighbors 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 they are worried the whale would be 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.310
 the performance could only affect in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 something explodes and you imagine looking at the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.399
 whale is next to a ride 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.289
 maritime there are many is a place 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.960
 tourism is a tourist destination the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.390
 surgery explodes the look I proposed 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.789
 go down to go to executive doctor show 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.830
 a video of a whale exploding 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.530
 when she is about to be disappointed 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.950
 by a scientist and gave him late 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 impression that not even what 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.479
 imagine what impression 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.400
 the disgust that would obviously be 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.650
 for the place 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.530
 of the visits of a similar animal 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.920
 size scattered everywhere 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.290
 good would be real investment problem 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.570
 really this clean the smell that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.430
 would stay for a long time good 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.030
 for now no one takes over the whale 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.760
 is more and more swollen and the neighbors 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.760
 that help us more worried than all
