we need the microwave yeah and also it's
it's<00:03:20.340> still<00:03:20.519> doing<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.790> thing<00:03:21.000> because<00:03:21.630> we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
it's still doing this thing because we

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.620 
it's still doing this thing because we
have<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> lot<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.260> leftovers<00:03:22.920> for<00:03:23.100> tortillas

sadly<00:03:24.799> we<00:03:25.799> need<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> use<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.120> we<00:03:27.269> figured

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
sadly we need to use them so we figured

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.310 
sadly we need to use them so we figured
a<00:03:27.630> good<00:03:27.870> way<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.080> use<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> movie<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.920> make<00:03:28.950> egg<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
a good way to use a movie to make egg in

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.310 
a good way to use a movie to make egg in
bacon<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.530> sausage<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.670> cheese<00:03:33.320> tortillas

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
bacon and sausage and cheese tortillas

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.009 
bacon and sausage and cheese tortillas

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
I have no idea what is the difference

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.449
