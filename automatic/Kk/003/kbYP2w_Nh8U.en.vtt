00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.960 

bring<00:00:31.750> that<00:00:31.869> back<00:00:32.110> half<00:00:32.440> way<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.550> bring<00:00:33.850> it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
bring that back half way and bring it

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.930 
bring that back half way and bring it
forward<00:00:34.000> half<00:00:34.570> of<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:39.370> our<00:00:39.489> wing<00:00:39.699> I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
forward half of that and for our wing I

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
forward half of that and for our wing I
have<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.090> pair<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:41.519> dark<00:00:42.519> slate<00:00:44.040> CDC<00:00:45.040> feathers

for<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.589> size<00:00:47.830> 20<00:00:48.309> I<00:00:48.339> think<00:00:49.110> CDC<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.260> probably

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
for a size 20 I think CDC is probably

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
for a size 20 I think CDC is probably
the<00:00:50.830> best<00:00:51.040> way<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.250> go

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.789 

just<00:00:54.670> take<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.970> feathers<00:00:55.360> bind<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.320> tips<00:00:56.589> and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
just take the feathers bind the tips and

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.160 
just take the feathers bind the tips and
draw<00:00:57.519> them<00:00:57.729> all<00:00:57.940> together<00:01:00.629> measure<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.839> up<00:01:01.960> of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
draw them all together measure it up of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:15.510 
draw them all together measure it up of
course<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.820> since<00:01:07.720> that<00:01:07.930> feather<00:01:08.260> down<00:01:14.520> thing

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
course and since that feather down thing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.970 
course and since that feather down thing
get<00:01:15.640> rid<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.940> excess<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.650> probably

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
get rid of the excess you can probably

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.320 
get rid of the excess you can probably
use<00:01:18.190> those<00:01:18.430> same<00:01:18.760> feathers<00:01:19.150> on<00:01:19.330> another<00:01:19.630> fly

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
use those same feathers on another fly

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.550 
use those same feathers on another fly
we're<00:01:22.330> not<00:01:22.450> going<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.750> split<00:01:23.140> these<00:01:23.290> or
