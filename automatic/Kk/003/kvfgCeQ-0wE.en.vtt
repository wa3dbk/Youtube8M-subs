00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.580 
you probably can guess by the thumbnail
and<00:00:27.539> such<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.830> first<00:00:29.340> off<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.939> have

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
like so this one is a bit yellow and as

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.080 
like so this one is a bit yellow and as
you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.100> soles<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> his<00:00:53.640> eyes<00:00:53.850> are

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you can see these soles of his eyes are

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
you can see these soles of his eyes are
blue<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.870> both<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> them<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.770> nothing<00:00:56.340> too

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
blue on both of them so nothing too

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.119 
blue on both of them so nothing too
different<00:00:56.940> there<00:00:57.120> unlike<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
different there unlike on the

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
different there unlike on the
Bulbasaur's<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> look<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.300> his<00:01:00.390> tail

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Bulbasaur's and if you look at his tail

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
Bulbasaur's and if you look at his tail
and<00:01:00.899> everything<00:01:01.199> else<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> basic

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and everything else it kind of is basic

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
and everything else it kind of is basic
I<00:01:02.699> mean<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.120> isn't<00:01:03.449> too<00:01:03.690> much<00:01:03.899> different

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I mean there isn't too much different

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
I mean there isn't too much different
about<00:01:04.500> Charmeleon<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.189> Charmander<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.260> he

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
about Charmeleon or Charmander and he

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.310 
about Charmeleon or Charmander and he
just<00:01:07.619> has<00:01:07.770> his<00:01:08.430> skin<00:01:08.939> color<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.869> yellow

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
just has his skin color is just yellow

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
just has his skin color is just yellow

see the eyes turn green this time so
that's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.280> different<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.670> than

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that's a little bit different but than

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.830 
that's a little bit different but than
that<00:01:54.030> everything<00:01:54.360> else<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> same

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that everything else is the same

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
that everything else is the same
stomachs<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> same<00:01:56.340> color

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
stomachs are pretty much the same color

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
stomachs are pretty much the same color
this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> slightly<00:01:57.509> different<00:01:57.840> shade

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this is like a slightly different shade

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
this is like a slightly different shade
it's<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> yellow<00:01:59.189> mixed<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.700> white<00:01:59.880> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's like a yellow mixed with white and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
it's like a yellow mixed with white and
that's<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> red<00:02:00.450> mixed<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.930> white<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.560> I'd

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that's a red mixed with white but I'd

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
that's a red mixed with white but I'd
almost<00:02:01.799> say<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.340> regular<00:02:02.790> ones<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.210> better

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
almost say the regular ones look better

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.600 
almost say the regular ones look better
here<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.780> mean<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.170> an<00:02:04.290> orange<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.189> red

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
here I mean that's an orange this is red

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
here I mean that's an orange this is red
