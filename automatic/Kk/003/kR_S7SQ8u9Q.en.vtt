00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
can see just a little bit of I guess

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.179 
can see just a little bit of I guess
bubbles<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:18.529> particles<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.680> finish<00:00:19.949> but

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
bubbles or particles in the finish but

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
bubbles or particles in the finish but
it's<00:00:20.369> not<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.510> doesn't<00:00:21.539> stand<00:00:21.960> out

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it's not it's not it doesn't stand out

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's not it's not it doesn't stand out
at<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.220> considering<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.060> his<00:00:24.150> paintings

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
at all and considering out his paintings

on<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> dirty<00:00:24.810> garage<00:00:25.080> floor<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.680> guess<00:00:26.279> that's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
on a dirty garage floor I guess that's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.870 
on a dirty garage floor I guess that's
not<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> bad<00:00:26.849> deal<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:28.340> little<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> wet

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
not a bad deal a little bit of a wet

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
not a bad deal a little bit of a wet
edge<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> decided<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:31.050> gonna<00:00:31.140> try<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
edge here I decided I'm gonna try to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.440 
edge here I decided I'm gonna try to
sand<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.740> off<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.880> doesn't<00:00:33.180> matter<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
sand that off it doesn't matter that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.959 
sand that off it doesn't matter that
much<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.980> could<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.309> dealt<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
much but that could be dealt with if you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.869 
much but that could be dealt with if you
really<00:00:36.180> wanted<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:37.399> yeah<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> looks<00:00:38.670> pretty

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
really wanted to yeah it looks pretty

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
really wanted to yeah it looks pretty
decent<00:00:39.030> let's<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.899> looks<00:00:40.050> over<00:00:40.260> here

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
decent let's see how it looks over here

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:55.459 
decent let's see how it looks over here
a<00:00:42.860> little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:53.210> pretty<00:00:54.210> proud<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a little bit pretty proud of that all

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.950 
a little bit pretty proud of that all
the<00:00:55.620> pieces<00:00:55.770> look<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> only<00:00:56.730> thing

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
the pieces look like that the only thing

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.360 
the pieces look like that the only thing
would<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> side<00:00:58.859> rails<00:00:59.160> or<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.370> they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
would be the side rails or you know they

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
would be the side rails or you know they
were<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> worse<00:01:02.850> shape<00:01:02.879> than<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.390> stuff<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
were in worse shape than the stuff so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.219 
were in worse shape than the stuff so
they<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:04.949> grain<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.049> didn't

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
they had more grain to them and I didn't

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
they had more grain to them and I didn't
want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> spend<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:07.890> sanding<00:01:08.460> them

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
want to spend as much time sanding them

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820 
want to spend as much time sanding them
to<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:08.880> flat<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to get them flat like this so you can

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
to get them flat like this so you can
see<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:11.130> texture<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.090> definitely<00:01:12.930> if

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
see more texture to it but definitely if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
see more texture to it but definitely if
I<00:01:13.830> wanted<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> next<00:01:14.490> year<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.820> those<00:01:15.000> back

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
I wanted to next year take those back

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
I wanted to next year take those back
off<00:01:15.530> stand<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.710> some<00:01:16.890> more<00:01:17.040> throw<00:01:17.580> about

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
off stand them some more throw about

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
off stand them some more throw about
another<00:01:17.970> four<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.270> five<00:01:18.330> coats<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.560> could

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
another four or five coats and I could

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
another four or five coats and I could
have<00:01:20.040> those<00:01:20.189> rails<00:01:20.400> looking<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.060> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
have those rails looking like that so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
have those rails looking like that so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
see that graininess right there a little
bit<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:43.100> little<00:01:44.100> bit<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> stuff<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.829> bubbles

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
