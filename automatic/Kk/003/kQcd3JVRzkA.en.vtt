handful of seconds or so I mean wasn't

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.440 
handful of seconds or so I mean wasn't
very<00:00:34.079> long<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:35.070> second<00:00:35.520> time<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> woke

very long this second time when I woke
up<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.380> surrounded<00:00:37.590> by<00:00:38.010> flames<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
up I was surrounded by flames and I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.299 
up I was surrounded by flames and I
could<00:00:39.030> feel<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> warmth<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> flame<00:00:40.309> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
could feel the warmth of the flame so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
could feel the warmth of the flame so
when<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> couple<00:00:42.570> those<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:42.930> together<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
when I couple those two together it's it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.440 
when I couple those two together it's it
really<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:46.530> brings<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> life<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.000> shows

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
really it brings that to life and shows

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.369 
really it brings that to life and shows
me<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> reality<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> Hell<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.670> mean<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> first

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
me the reality of Hell I mean the first

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.650 
me the reality of Hell I mean the first
time<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> didn't<00:00:52.890> feel<00:00:53.100> any<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.399> wasn't<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.300> wasn't

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
time I didn't feel any I wasn't I wasn't

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.130 
time I didn't feel any I wasn't I wasn't
made<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> could<00:00:55.350> feeling<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> heat<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
made so I could feeling in the heat and

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
made so I could feeling in the heat and
so<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.500> guess<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.699> my<00:01:00.059> part<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.629> didn't

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so I guess you know on my part I didn't

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.039 
so I guess you know on my part I didn't
think<00:01:01.410> enough<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.210> much<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
think enough of it or as much as of it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
think enough of it or as much as of it
as<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> should<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.519> second<00:01:05.880> time<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
as I should have and the second time I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
as I should have and the second time I
could<00:01:07.049> feel<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> warmth<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> flame<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
could feel the warmth of the flame and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
could feel the warmth of the flame and
in<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.760> heart<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.780> calm<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.500> that's
