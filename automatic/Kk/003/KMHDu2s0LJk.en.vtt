so<00:00:02.370> here's<00:00:02.610> today's<00:00:02.850> project<00:00:03.419> dig<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.020> big<00:00:04.230> hole

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so here's today's project dig a big hole

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.639 
so here's today's project dig a big hole
in<00:00:05.359> search<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.390> where<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.049> roots<00:00:07.379> are

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
in search of where the roots are

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.060 
in search of where the roots are
entering<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.370> sewer<00:00:08.670> line<00:00:09.469> here's<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.769> dirt

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
entering the sewer line here's the dirt

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.320 
entering the sewer line here's the dirt
mound<00:00:11.400> from<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:14.269> so<00:00:15.269> basically<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.980> is

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
mound from it so basically this way is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.470 
mound from it so basically this way is
towards<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> water<00:00:20.520> drains<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
towards the way the water drains and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.400 
towards the way the water drains and
this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> clean-out<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.660> clay<00:00:28.050> pipe

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this is the clean-out and this clay pipe

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
this is the clean-out and this clay pipe
here<00:00:32.000> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:34.520> elbow<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.149> turns<00:00:36.600> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here this is the elbow that turns that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
here this is the elbow that turns that
way<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> clay<00:00:40.950> pipe<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
way and this clay pipe here this is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430 
way and this clay pipe here this is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and you can see there the root growing

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.479 
and you can see there the root growing
in<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.780> there<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.860> there's<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.159> roots

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
in it right there and there's just roots

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.750 
in it right there and there's just roots
growing<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.390> every<00:01:07.340> single<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> these

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
hard to see there's a root growing in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.380 
hard to see there's a root growing in
right<00:01:26.150> there<00:01:27.640> roots<00:01:28.640> growing<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:29.330> here<00:01:34.390> you

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

can see this pipe must sweat because the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.080 
can see this pipe must sweat because the
roots<00:01:38.180> were<00:01:39.080> literally<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.070> rug<00:01:40.580> wrapped

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
can see there where the roots are

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.260 
can see there where the roots are
getting<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.130> around<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.700> seal<00:03:29.880> there's<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
getting in around the seal there's the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.900 
getting in around the seal there's the
cast<00:03:31.810> iron<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.530> clay<00:03:32.800> fitting<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.460> right<00:03:33.610> there

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
cast iron a clay fitting and right there

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.670 
cast iron a clay fitting and right there
as<00:03:34.060> where<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.390> roots<00:03:34.600> were<00:03:34.900> coming<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.440> right

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
as where the roots were coming in right

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.900 
as where the roots were coming in right
along<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.160> bottom<00:03:41.250> trying<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.400> figure<00:03:42.730> out

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
along the bottom trying to figure out

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.750 
along the bottom trying to figure out
how<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.270> get<00:03:43.570> this<00:03:44.010> piece<00:03:45.010> outing<00:03:45.490> or<00:03:45.550> without

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
how to get this piece outing or without

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.410 
how to get this piece outing or without
cracking<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.420> outer<00:03:47.490> lip<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:48.880> found<00:03:49.210> that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
cracking the outer lip and I found that

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.110 
cracking the outer lip and I found that
the<00:03:49.630> torch<00:03:50.320> really<00:03:50.920> softens<00:03:51.550> this
