00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.290
 This is the first bracelet we have 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.450
 fact 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.830
 if you remember 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 15 ball chains 2 ball chains 2 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 so good chains up to 14 balls 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.010
 other possibilities to do this 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.650
 bracelet then instead of using 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 the pearl thread that is with what 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.530
 we have done 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.860
 Well, we can go to the stores that sell 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.470
 beads and things to make necklaces and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.030
 there they sell threads like this 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.170
 this thread 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.089
 it's stiffer 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 but the advantage it has regarding 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.680
 this is because being stiffer is much 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.540
 easier to set the balls 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.870
 what can be done to channel them 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.770
 no needle is needed let's leave this to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 a side 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.299
 we take glue 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.299
 we throw glue on the edge 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.470
 with the hand we clean a little 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.710
 that no raid is left 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.630
 and when it dries we have the tip 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 ready to set the balls 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.869
 we take the good 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 we put it in and it's as easy as this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.020
 we need a needle and this is the most 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020
 more comfortable 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.210
 they take care 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 you can follow 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.100
 and this thread the only thing I'm going to show is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.020
 how is the chain for you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.020
 give an idea of ​​how it could be 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.579
 we make the first point 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719
 we give you a little 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 the second 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.270
 you see it here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.770
 difficulty is in the tension of the thread 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.270
 and leave it the size that we like 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.270
 because the thread is harder 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.520
 and it stays this way 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.910
 in a ball for you to see 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.470
 and this would be
