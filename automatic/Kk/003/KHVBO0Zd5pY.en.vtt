explain

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.370 

and<00:01:33.900> set<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.050> aside

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and set this aside

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.170 
and set this aside
so<00:01:36.920> by<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.100> time<00:01:37.220> our<00:01:37.490> dough<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.730> resting

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
so by the time our dough is resting

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.450 
so by the time our dough is resting
let's<00:01:38.630> prepare<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.080> stuffing<00:01:39.620> for<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.010> pasta
