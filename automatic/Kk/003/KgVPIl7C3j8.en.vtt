00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 you want to achieve a concrete effect 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 resolutely modern with subtle nuances 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 without complicating the task 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
 opt for paints with concrete effects for 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 apply it collect the products 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 indispensable 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 the concrete effect paints jump the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.939
 short hair roller and the trowel 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 concrete effect paints before 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.050
 start protecting your soil and all 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.779
 edges of the surface to be applied with a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 tarpaulin and duct tape paints to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 concrete effects can be applied without 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.719
 under specific layer and on a wall 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 clean smooth this a failure an impression 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 insulation is necessary on the supports 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 raw or new before starting 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 the application carefully read the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.399
 user manual very practical paintings 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.460
 concrete effects and already tinted 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 so you can apply it directly 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 dipped the short hair rollers into the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 concrete effect paint and then drop the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 material on a square of about 50 by 50 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.739
 cm cross the movements for good 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 divide the material once this quarter 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 is applied without waiting high school the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 matter with the little trowel 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.760
 transparent in all directions 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.490
 without immediately seeking to create a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.220
 decor the background of the support appears in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.000
 transparency is normal in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.680
 angles proceed as well 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 to follow the same on the rest of the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.290
 surface by going from the top left point 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 to the bottom right corner 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.620
 once the area covered if it remains 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 transparencies they will be 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.980
 covered by a second layer 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 let it dry for one to two hours to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.030
 get a smooth surface and if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 it seems to you necessary you can 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 think lightly the first layer 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.390
 before applying the second for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 realize the second layer take a little 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.500
 of concrete effect paint from the end of the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.640
 trowel then went there in very fine 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.010
 layers by scraping the material you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 thus completely cover the mu recreate 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.160
 the shades concrete effect let dry 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.050
 a day once the wall is dry 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.290
 rub it with a fine woolen meadow 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.290
 steel 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.500
 thanks to that strach or shoe the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.780
 matter the rank of the most hermetic or 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.810
 highlights his nuances and his 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.940
 Moirage paints with concrete effects is 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 ideal to give a youthful look to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.819
 your furniture applied the same 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.200
 roll and then trowel 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.150
 concrete effect paints do not flow and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.940
 is easily deposited in the corners and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.610
 on the edges past the steel wool 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.050
 it's like new 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.819
 if you want to bring more 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.350
 resistance and viability 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.400
 we advise you to apply the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.400
 wax moon dust 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.250
 I summarize to realize my painting 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.400
 with concrete effect I apply the painting to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.129
 concrete effect and I finalize with the wool 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.290
 steel concrete effect paint 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.629
 applies in the day she is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.510
 resistant without the need for protection 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:04.090
 at the door to the interiors a raw decor 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.090
 and design both pure and soft
