00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hi dear viewer in repair with us 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.090
 camera panasonic whether mts 30 defect is not 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.420
 the camera leaves the lens 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.240
 message system errors repairing 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 partially disassembled the camera disassembly 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 performed similarly to others 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.710
 cameras corresponding video clip 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 present on our channel 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.689
 Demonstration of the defect when turned on 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.490
 the camera displays an error message 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.820
 scaling with this lens even 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.920
 not trying to produce movement 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.120
 scaling lenses deals 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.280
 electric motor which is called 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.129
 Zuma engines to start with, we decided 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 check not to break the lens cable 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.590
 why suspicion fell on the train because 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
 that there is a suspicious bend 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.570
 plume in which it is very possible 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 the appearance of a break disable the loop and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 lens and dismantle the lens to with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 it was more convenient for him to work now 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.490
 turn on the multimeter in dialing mode 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.340
 chains and check the tracks one by one 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.520
 engine loop track check in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 starting and ending point 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.220
 initial . this is a contact 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 electric motor 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.710
 and the end point is the corresponding 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 contact at the end of the loop which one 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 contact we find visually connect 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 one fur coat per contact electric motors 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 and the second to contact the loop, we have 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 found that one of the tracks of the train 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.280
 is on the other side of the cliff 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.549
 rang means she has no cliff 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 so have one track loop which 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 feeds the motor breakage it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 means that the power to the motor is not 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.450
 comes in so the lens cannot 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.640
 open up and just because of it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.430
 camera error occurs when 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.040
 turning on now you see the contacts 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.680
 plumes that feed the electric motor 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.119
 these are extreme right lanes they 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 relatively wide 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.720
 And this is the ill-starred bend in which 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.210
 there was an open loop trail 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.310
 what do we need to do to 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.680
 restore power to the motor 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 you need to replace the patch 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.360
 in which there is a cliff for 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
 replacement of the plot of the loop will be 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.340
 use thin wire such 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.920
 wire can be extracted from the cable yusb 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.250
 mouse or keyboard or similar 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.250
 devices 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.490
 choose a convenient part of the loop to 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.140
 We will fluster the wire we clean 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.240
 loop terminator to conductor 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.260
 Rome nonter makes it pointy 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:53.820
 we apply a flat screwdriver polished 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 Flux section soldered with a soldering iron to 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.970
 it was easy to solder our 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.640
 know-how from Rome Unter as 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 you can just clean the surface 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:14.600
 soldering go to the process when soldering 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.600
 wire first tinned wire 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.530
 we solder to contact on the electric motor 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:31.430
 and solder the second end of the wire to 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 matching track is great with one 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.220
 track now figured it out for 2 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.590
 why does rima nonter replace both 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.860
 track then as in the cliff only one 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.800
 track loop because together the bend 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.420
 and 2 track will ever break to 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.150
 this did not cause a malfunction 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:59.870
 Cameras need to remove your problem 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:02.299
 track loop when you need to restore 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.910
 make sure that the wire does not touch 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.069
 not with another wire not with any 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.100
 metal parts of the camera 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.709
 since the wire is not insulated this 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.290
 ready work is only needed 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.299
 isolate the wire can use 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.520
 for this tape will check whether 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.250
 power supplied to the motor 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.340
 for this we will use 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.700
 laboratory power supply voltage 2.4 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.470
 volt connect the power supply contacts 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.150
 plume 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.310
 lens goes out and drives in all 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.800
 works now can connect 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.800
 camera lens check operation 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.639
 turn on the camera or 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.339
 she earned the lens opened the display 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.669
 shows the image from the lens 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:29.330
 take a picture and you can fully assemble 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.330
 camera 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.770
 we test work 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.770
 this repair is completed and we say goodbye to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.540
 you dear viewer will be new videos 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.540
 there will be new repairs and 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.830
 measuring
