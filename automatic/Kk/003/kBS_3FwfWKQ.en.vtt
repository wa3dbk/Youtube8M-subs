00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 you can imagine that Mr. Juan 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 Manuel Herrera goes with the uncle not us 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.610
 we continue to look emphasize the paper below 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.019
 up and I'm very excited about the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 morning handkerchief 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.720
 for classic appointment of bakeries and sweet 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 of milk can be started by the sweet 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 of milk from the one below or the cream 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.650
 as more than one I put there is a tip 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.579
 and we are going to be the departures 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.570
 in the bakery starts doing what 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.930
 we are doing 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.930
 perfect but you can see 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.180
 the important thing is sweet milk to make 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.760
 this type of preparation 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.460
 is that the lucense is flexible 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 if you get a series that is too much 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.129
 hard 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.449
 what you are going to do is adding a 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.260
 little syrup to loosen a little 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 thank you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.870
 it is possible it is not the permission because not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.390
 they saw the issue of what 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.310
 it is something more to make it more fluid 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.490
 alfio basile but do not pass it then if not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.979
 do not 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 no parts and then you add too much 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.720
 lithium if what is going to happen to you 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.869
 we have it too wet 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 exactly what we do is truffle 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 socially that the fine masita have 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.300
 on the one hand the handkerchiefs with the dough 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.610
 of tender 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:52.800
 and they can also have bits 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.800
 constants by cattle land 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 quality 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.509
 well there you have to be a square 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.509
 perfect 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.350
 the vibrations 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.350
 well it's very well played 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.350
 two 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.190
 in front of 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.970
 Y 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.560
 in his four crimes so that I stay 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.560
 a friend on the side because 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.030
 good not for to send the quarrel 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.030
 as well 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.820
 and alves 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 it is enough to do it to ricardito if able by 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.890
 favor 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 do not 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.500
 is there crouched you dress like 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.080
 look 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.080
 and then simply for this reason 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.170
 so the memory of a handkerchief 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:42.450
 per unit because then it is very possible 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.930
 and Carlos Moya to weigh more not 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.930
 they are making you arm I do not know 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.520
 accomplice head 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.050
 on the ship it was the cold of age me 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.350
 you can get to explain the full 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.350
 jury 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.350
 say 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:11.269
 the line some too many just say 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.269
 because how much richer 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.479
 but let's get him the nice cream 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:32.770
 the only thing that was small squared 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:34.449
 we close the tips so they have the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.590
 idea 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.590
 to tell 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.870
 and this same to what tempting we are 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.870
 making more akin to the kitchen 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.080
 Nobel flags and back a little scratched 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.080
 in the thin dough 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.730
 the party and friends 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.810
 there we are going to double caprecom in the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.599
 time one day that he had left 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.830
 of the woman to be told how 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.910
 we know that he has to resort to the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.910
 theme of the truth not a little bit 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.699
 with the coconut what we do is the same 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.990
 already strong with complete 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.639
 teaching to do it without series to one by 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.639
 one of these taxis 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.289
 and the other thing that sometimes I insist a lot 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.539
 is that beyond what is bakery and 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.919
 pastry learn what is speed 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.789
 At the beginning you do not have to learn to be 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.740
 prolix 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.740
 because the speed after coming alone 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.570
 of gymnastics exactly 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.630
 because you opened something that is not going to 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.460
 watch 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.620
 They are coming palmitos was alone 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.319
 is also not to be thinner after 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.060
 with layers of pionono but in some 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.060
 Towers and it's outside 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.020
 I'm going to finish this because I have more and 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.020
 plus 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.050
 is living now and is imminent 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.250
 ladies and give me the prescribed recipe 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.420
 this section in which you do not do 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.850
 because we five years of the 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.340
 program until cons we share a lot 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.380
 and now we want to hear what are the 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.910
 recipes that you have that are 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.130
 valuable that everyone tells you 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.620
 there is the rhythm that comes out of this today 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.930
 let's call susana uncles to participate 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.970
 in the section the seen of the day is a duo 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.030
 of the edited recipe and the book of 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.950
 Simple as Peruvian we have stew that 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.810
 every week soaks and sobisch 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.750
 or lentils I was not susana I do not know 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.169
 if less the surname of susana and that we 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.789
 they are going to teach how to make a stew 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:27.469
 sometimes with their prescription monitoring 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.960
 these warriors from their halls that has 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:31.520
 quite a few peculiarities has been 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.840
 listening is very very good so 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.320
 in one having nothing else stay there 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.480
 obviously to hear it 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.310
 this million is not ending going 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.130
 ending 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:47.280
 I stay but not after 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.280
 averages and much less freedom 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.470
 they left developed that takes the 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.039
 hillside to finish service that 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.210
 never 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:57.210
 then yes no
