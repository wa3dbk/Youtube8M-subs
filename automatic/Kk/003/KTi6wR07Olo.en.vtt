case<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.310> well<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:27.299> mean<00:01:28.299> I<00:01:28.450> paid<00:01:28.750> less<00:01:28.930> than

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990

300<00:01:29.530> dollars<00:01:29.799> for<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:29.979> guitar<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.670> think

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
300 dollars for this guitar and I think

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.810 
300 dollars for this guitar and I think
it's<00:01:31.060> worth<00:01:31.270> every<00:01:31.509> single<00:01:31.990> penny<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.700> you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it's worth every single penny so if you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.429 
it's worth every single penny so if you
go<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.210> store<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.750> they<00:01:35.049> happen<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.350> have

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
go to the store and they happen to have

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.859 
go to the store and they happen to have
one<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.860> these<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:37.360> get<00:01:37.570> it

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
one of these go get it

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.260 
one of these go get it
because<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.070> don't<00:01:39.549> think<00:01:39.820> they<00:01:39.909> made<00:01:40.119> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
because I don't think they made that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.340 
because I don't think they made that
many<00:01:40.450> supposedly<00:01:41.080> was<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.819> production

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
many supposedly was a production

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.010 
many supposedly was a production
short-run<00:01:44.350> production<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.690> go<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.869> a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
short-run production so if you go to a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.700 
short-run production so if you go to a
fender<00:01:47.350> dealer<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.920> see<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.700> think
