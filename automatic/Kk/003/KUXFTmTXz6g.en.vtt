that<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:01.890> wasn't<00:05:02.130> clicking<00:05:02.310> with<00:05:02.640> me<00:05:02.760> when<00:05:02.940> I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that just wasn't clicking with me when I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.960 
that just wasn't clicking with me when I
was<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.240> chemistry<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:05.310> think<00:05:05.640> was<00:05:05.760> coming

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
was in chemistry and I think was coming

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.440 
was in chemistry and I think was coming
up<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.210> two<00:05:06.510> months<00:05:06.750> left<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.800> had<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.670> 44<00:05:09.330> in

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
up on two months left and I had a 44 in

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.080 
up on two months left and I had a 44 in
the<00:05:09.540> class<00:05:09.770> forty-four<00:05:10.770> percent<00:05:10.890> my<00:05:11.790> friend

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
the class forty-four percent my friend

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.640 
the class forty-four percent my friend
had<00:05:12.300> been<00:05:12.330> young<00:05:12.750> telling<00:05:13.260> me<00:05:13.350> was<00:05:13.440> like<00:05:13.500> oh

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650

when<00:05:14.010> I<00:05:14.040> was<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.340> chemistry<00:05:14.670> I<00:05:14.730> got<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.150> know

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
when I was in chemistry I got you know

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.670 
when I was in chemistry I got you know
yeah<00:05:15.450> I<00:05:15.480> from<00:05:15.720> this<00:05:15.840> guy<00:05:15.960> should<00:05:16.020> go<00:05:16.230> see<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.440> man

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
just it's like I'll make it I'll be fine

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.890 
just it's like I'll make it I'll be fine

help you know him young going over the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.850 
help you know him young going over the
quizzes<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.270> had<00:05:30.510> before<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:30.900> failed<00:05:31.380> going

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
quizzes I had before that failed going

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.740 
quizzes I had before that failed going
over<00:05:32.070> all<00:05:32.220> those<00:05:32.460> by<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.180> time<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.450> finished

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
over all those by the time I finished

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.290 
over all those by the time I finished
the<00:05:33.810> final<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.770> get<00:05:35.010> that<00:05:35.130> class<00:05:35.400> with<00:05:35.670> a<00:05:35.700> 74

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
the final I and get that class with a 74

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.530 
the final I and get that class with a 74
and<00:05:36.980> because<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.310> curve<00:05:38.730> that<00:05:39.060> there's<00:05:39.300> in

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
and because of the curve that there's in

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.910 
and because of the curve that there's in
chemistry<00:05:39.900> because<00:05:40.080> that<00:05:40.290> is<00:05:40.470> such<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.680> hard

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
chemistry because that is such a hard

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.999 
chemistry because that is such a hard
course<00:05:41.390> that<00:05:42.390> it<00:05:42.570> is<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.720> b-minus

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
course that it is a b-minus

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.700 
course that it is a b-minus
so

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
so

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.860 
so
don't<00:05:46.370> be<00:05:46.460> afraid<00:05:46.700> to<00:05:46.730> get<00:05:46.910> that<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:47.600> you<00:05:47.840> know

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
don't be afraid to get that but you know

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.470 
don't be afraid to get that but you know

then Intel which is what I used to be is

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.400 
then Intel which is what I used to be is
I<00:05:55.400> put<00:05:55.580> my<00:05:55.700> number<00:05:55.910> one<00:05:56.090> choice<00:05:56.120> for<00:05:56.750> diamond

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
I put my number one choice for diamond

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.570 
I put my number one choice for diamond
radium<00:05:57.530> then<00:05:57.830> I<00:05:57.950> have<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.220> other<00:05:58.250> five

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
radium then I have the other five

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.610 
radium then I have the other five
originally<00:05:59.570> when<00:05:59.720> I<00:05:59.780> got<00:05:59.960> here<00:06:00.140> I<00:06:00.200> wanted<00:06:00.530> to

originally when I got here I wanted to

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.410 
originally when I got here I wanted to
just<00:06:00.920> go<00:06:01.100> straight<00:06:01.370> RPAs<00:06:01.820> I<00:06:02.000> used<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.240> be<00:06:02.330> an

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
the Air Force Academy if you go straight

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.270 
the Air Force Academy if you go straight
rpa<00:06:06.080> immediately<00:06:06.710> it's<00:06:06.980> pretty<00:06:07.220> much

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
rpa immediately it's pretty much

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.030 
rpa immediately it's pretty much
impossible<00:06:07.460> to<00:06:08.120> try<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.360> go<00:06:08.510> pilot<00:06:08.900> later<00:06:09.140> but

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
impossible to try to go pilot later but

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.980 
impossible to try to go pilot later but
it's<00:06:10.160> really<00:06:10.460> easy<00:06:10.760> you<00:06:11.210> know<00:06:11.630> almost

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
it's really easy you know almost

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.930 
it's really easy you know almost
automatic<00:06:12.620> if<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:12.800> say<00:06:12.950> hey<00:06:13.130> I'm<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:13.340> pilot<00:06:13.580> hey

automatic if you say hey I'm a pilot hey

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.160 
automatic if you say hey I'm a pilot hey
I<00:06:14.030> want<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.210> go<00:06:14.300> into<00:06:14.420> our<00:06:14.510> piece<00:06:14.720> like<00:06:14.900> oh<00:06:14.990> yeah

sure there you go so I'm gonna they said

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.730 
sure there you go so I'm gonna they said
if<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:17.840> want<00:06:18.020> to<00:06:18.080> fly<00:06:18.230> if<00:06:18.440> you<00:06:18.500> have<00:06:18.590> any

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
if you want to fly if you have any

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.560 
if you want to fly if you have any
inclination<00:06:19.010> of<00:06:19.340> flying<00:06:19.610> try<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.300> get<00:06:20.480> it

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
inclination of flying try to get it

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.970 
inclination of flying try to get it
straight<00:06:20.600> out<00:06:20.810> here<00:06:21.110> because<00:06:21.470> because<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:21.920> my

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
straight out here because because of my

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.700 
straight out here because because of my
age<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.580> because<00:06:22.850> of<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.630> know<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:24.170> being

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
age and because of you know it being

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.280 
age and because of you know it being
hard<00:06:24.890> to<00:06:25.040> switch<00:06:25.840> this<00:06:26.840> pretty<00:06:27.110> much<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.260> only
