00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.570
 Well everyone 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:13.250
 Good evening it is this time zone 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:17.230
 Hello If you are looking to Zhu Luke's care in Good morning who have seen in the morning 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.370
 Black Gracia is 4 ws + units 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.180
 My thing is good even if I read Chapter Rutte 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:29.420
 Is this time I 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.200
 At that time I'm I was closer to the little strange 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.200
 Well pop 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:43.280
 For now, I'm in the middle of my second grade of junior high school. 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.000
 Though it is a little toy corner and I'm interested in it 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.860
 Especially I was saying there 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.810
 And then I I was looking at the corner of Pokemon 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.940
 Bit 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:01.359
 Is a new Pokemon that Nymphea ne of it 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.490
 I bought it because it sold stuffed animals 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.490
 its big 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.490
 The 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.850
 Oh this is it to lean for? 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.619
 Yes 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.619
 Yes I do not spot 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 It was 980 yen 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.400
 I mean're in Yes pretty convoluted not military 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.400
 But it is likely to become entangled This 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.380
 But pretty cute yes 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 And I'm a second grader, but 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:46.190
 I love stuffy stuff like this 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.040
 I think there are people who thought Liga came in. This is 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.570
 It is quite a while ago 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.100
 I was selling that ev 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.750
 It is Jin 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 I'm doing well here too 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.790
 so 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.299
 It ends with the introduction voice of め ぐ る み 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.340
 I went to when I was a little look at the corner of Bacha Gacha 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 A lot of ev full collection It was a one time 200 yen of a guy 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.780
 Huh 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.680
 I'm sorry to display it for a moment 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.680
 We went 2,200 yen 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.569
 I think that it is not enough for 1200 yen if it is this number 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 Because I do not reveal much care 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 It is double 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 We have a double body 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.599
 Most of these accessories 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.830
 Of such figures of Nendoron Ido figure 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.090
 I use a guy card 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.970
 So 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 Sadly I couldn't do it with only Glacia 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.569
 next time 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.590
 I went to the place where the gacha was 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.590
 I think I want to do it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.940
 Music such as after is flowing 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.020
 It is such feeling that can not be taken 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.060
 It is unexpectedly large 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.200
 6 in line with ev 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.200
 There loaned by a fine 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.050
 day 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.050
 Sings of good sayings already end with this 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.080
 The next work is already decided yes 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 I would like to go out with broken if possible tomorrow 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 Yes 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.510
 Mr. Block I love airguns 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.709
 I want to shoot that air related 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.909
 a I want to shoot in the autumn leaves special feature What's this user and eagle 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.760
 Was it 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 I am a good chestnut with a discer 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:09.030
 If you know Desert Eagle, you know it is a little bit better 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:10.819
 I would like to do something about this here 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.680
