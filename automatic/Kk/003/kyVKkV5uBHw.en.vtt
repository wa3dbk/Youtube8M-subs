00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.820
 when you ask for telepizza you just want that 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.950
 I got telepizza I wanted to ask 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.829
 for the political play of the game by 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.789
 that penalty in the 92nd minute if he has 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.300
 viewed 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.910
 if you think it has been fair and in short 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.040
 what is your opinion final reason but 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 antic the last minute many individuals 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 He called a penalty and said mind of 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.220
 yourselves you will say 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 to remain of antenna 3 television me 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.879
 would like to know if you can know what 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.120
 the referee has said at the end of the match 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.129
 if the referee has attended to reasons and 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 that could be explained to him and that has 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.510
 said of the play of the penalty 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.950
 I exist 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.049
 I have not spoken to the referee I have only 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 looked 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.590
 of the team 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 game auto world player 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.680
 the musician very post that very well 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 22 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.980
 I think we deserved to win the game 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.930
 we had the game in our 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.460
 control at all times perhaps the only 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.860
 error that we have committed has been that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.110
 after 1-0 we have not done even more 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.970
 with control of the game but still 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 I think we have been better and that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.560
 we should have won by more goals 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.790
 they will actually be games in 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.860
 universally 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.170
 I download the station has to do with 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.340
 concern and it's good to close goals or 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.340
 die is from fields 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.209
 before the future 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.320
 I only go out with my death and comfort 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.780
 if they see it in and options 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.960
 they ask mÃ­ster about the lack of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.690
 team goal and your answer is 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.460
 it's true we have to score more goals 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.770
 today we lacked our top scorer 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.330
 that is Carlos sailing and obviously without him 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.000
 the task of marking a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.190
 goal yet I think we've made a game 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.690
 in order to score more goals we have done 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.040
 very good things especially in terms of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.440
 elaboration of the game but it has 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.270
 missed a bit in the last third yet 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 so I think the 1-0 was enough to 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.590
 win the game I do not think the lift 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.420
 has done has created opportunities like 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.719
 to be able to tie the match 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.760
 and I guess it's frustrating to close the 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.019
 year having had at hand 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.209
 a victory and doing it only with 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.260
 tie in the ranking are two 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.579
 points because how to be here but 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.579
 I suppose they are many points 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.160
 very well 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 Burgos 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.789
 d 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400
 waters 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.750
 If I'm disappointed about not having 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.640
 could win the game today I think 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.040
 We have worked very hard and we have done 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.300
 merits to win the game 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.860
 repeat again I think our mistake 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.240
 has been that after 1-0 we had to 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.890
 have played more we had to have 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.170
 followed by creating occasions to go in search of 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.490
 more goals and we have not done yet 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.350
 I think that we had to take 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.460
 the three points here and I had to 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.000
 having been our first victory 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.000
 away from home 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.740
 and I would like to know how it is 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:12.180
 channels and if the change has been because 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.180
 it is injured waters channels and without llull 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.030
 I'm not sure I have an injury 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.860
 had had some problems in the 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.860
 twins and he has replaced that
