00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
a third squad of our space was so really

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.780 
a third squad of our space was so really
looking<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.470> keep<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.100> advantage<00:04:35.520> there<00:04:35.669> in

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
looking to keep the advantage there in

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.630 
looking to keep the advantage there in
terms<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.090> numbers<00:04:36.740> looks<00:04:37.740> like<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.950> heretic

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
terms of numbers looks like a heretic

going<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.600> complete<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:40.320> point<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.710> think<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
going to complete this point I think the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.380 
going to complete this point I think the
spaceman's<00:04:41.430> won't<00:04:41.640> prevent<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.120> if

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
spaceman's won't prevent that and if
