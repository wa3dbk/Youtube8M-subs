00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.320
 very good friends we are back here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.560
 in the garage I'm still inside the new 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.720
 jeep cherokee 2014 I repeat is the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.210
 basic version called the attitude 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 has very good finished look at the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.110
 board is that cooked if you have the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.419
 apparent seams you even want 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.910
 open here in this is your compartment 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.380
 has a rubber bottom that will not stop 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.040
 that things sound a lot open 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.650
 slowly as it should be we have 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.630
 digital air conditioning curiously 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.410
 the air conditioning and the system 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.940
 heating are digital because they do not 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.400
 you raise or lower the temperature with those 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 controls but does not tell you what temperature 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.610
 even if we go here on the screen 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.590
 air conditioning what we have is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.840
 hot cold but tells us the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.480
 temperature that is for an air 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.520
 digital is weird but we have here a 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.130
 usb input an auxiliary one socket 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.229
 current an sd input for 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.539
 the navigation system that is not in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.030
 is in this version and this version 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.460
 has a 5-inch screen 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 the upper versions limit the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 award limit and 3 hold has a 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.049
 8.4 inch screen and this one has 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 a screen of 5 the space I repeat 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.319
 it's pretty good 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 Visibility is nice to face 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.220
 forward if the pillar is thick 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.530
 but he 's used to this in a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.380
 truck the only thing I do not like about the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.970
 Visibility is back three quarters 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 because because this glass is very 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.819
 boy and from the outside it does not look like it but 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 from inside with the coverage what you 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.950
 remains of visibility area is more or 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.560
 except this you see it still inclined and you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.459
 it is with less visibility still this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 version has a four- cylinder engine 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:07.020
 2.4 liters the tiger shark manufactured here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.729
 in Mexico in the north of the country and as 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.790
 all new but here has a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.730
 gearbox 9 speed 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.980
 is premiering a box of fossett to 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.530
 9-speed efe and that box is what 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 better and at the same time the not so good thing about this 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.319
 truck because it's the best because it 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.159
 It takes out this engine much more juice than it 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.200
 takes out the box that brings the dodge dart 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.209
 currently the box of 62 with this 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.879
 heaviest truck is about 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.400
 1700 kilos this version can reach 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.380
 even above 180 almost 2 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.860
 tons in the hawk tribe 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.780
 we achieved 12.8 seconds from 0 to 100 here 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.340
 in guadalajara of one thousand 600 meters 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.819
 altitude of the sea level surely 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.150
 that number will be lower 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.280
 but the box is also its biggest 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.409
 problem at least in our judgment 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 because he never knows exactly what 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.329
 speed is and when you are in the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.170
 day-to-day traffic you go 30 40 50 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.139
 60 you are varying the speeds by the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.719
 semaphores bumps the bumps the cuate 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:19.129
 that tended to err, etc. obviously 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:22.349
 you vary the speeds and no way 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:25.290
 the box remains and rising and falling not 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.540
 knows what and jumps a lot you feel the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.760
 changes in a very marked way if you go 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.439
 for example you come in the peripheral to 60 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.650
 80 kilometers per hour constant are you 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.840
 very well in a free way of usa i am 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.639
 sure nobody is going to realize 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.739
 that brings a 9-speed box to 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.319
 otherwise it helps a lot in the economy of 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.599
 fuel too but that's that 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.740
 skip detail that takes away comfort 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.320
 in the van 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.490
 I do not know how it will work with the engine 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.440
 of 6 but with this engine I do not like 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.930
 much this version costs 382 thousand pesos 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.350
 the version that follows the limited has 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:10.270
 a price of 429 thousand the limit of 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 484,000 prize and he brought it as torbes 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.250
 extrazona integral and suitable for all 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:20.730
 land will cost 579 thousand 900 pesos 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.470
 I do not know for you, I think I already 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.470
 it does not lose you with those prices 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.990
 well let's talk now about the corvette 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.990
 stingray 2014 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.529
 the corvette has provoked me from 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 always very strange feelings 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.629
 found I have a lot of respect 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.759
 because I know what I can do 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.789
 I think everyone sees it from some 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:51.770
 way if you do not respect what is capable 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.850
 to make this car but 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.880
 traditionally I do not like the design 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.250
 it seems to me a design lacking in 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.670
 refinement a car that is capable of 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.970
 beat ferraresi porches on the road 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.520
 in design I think it needs 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.820
 that and I still believe that he needs 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.110
 I am still think it's not a car 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.110
 refined aesthetically enough 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.770
 speaking but there are two or three things in 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.510
 this car are very good and they are very much 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.340
 beyond aesthetic designs are made 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.670
 thought with a certain function 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.980
 so in this car it's not just seeing 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.820
 well that is also to make the 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.830
 things work for example this output 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:44.130
 of air is here so that there is less 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.710
 turbulence inside the wheels and 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.420
 brakes cool in a better way 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.150
 when the wheels spin at high speed 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.400
 it creates a lot of turbulence here and this 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.580
 allows the air to come out 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.690
 and turbulence decreases and then this 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.300
 air intake comes from the sides the 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.000
 car receives the air by this part 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.990
 up and the air gets in here and at 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.139
 get here between this part and is 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.750
 where it comes out generates a force towards 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.410
 down increasing the stability of the 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.810
 car here is the air outlet that 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.090
 enter this top part also 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.389
 this when you see it together from 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.360
 behind the car transmits a feeling of 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:35.120
 It is greater solidity of stay to be in 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.210
 the floor with a strong face where 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.600
 I'm here because 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.340
 but it's not like I even got to 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.620
 think about a principle of this piquito 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.410
 it's not just a function it does not have 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.530
 only an aesthetic function the leaks if 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.220
 it has only an aesthetic and good function 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.000
 everything else there is there 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.490
 as well 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.290
 in this car there was always always a 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.480
 practical side very interesting in the 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.120
 corvette and this follows us this is not the 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.340
 exception in a two-seater car all this 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.800
 luggage area is quite good 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.350
 put look here we have many 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.110
 areas for luggage right now I'm closing 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.960
 mesh and this little hand here helps us to 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.569
 when it's closed this does not look like 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.729
 that brings in the car then 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.949
 it's practically the only thing I'm missing 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:30.360
 talk is about the stingray not one of the 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:33.599
 species of rays that there is that is the 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.169
 distinguishes king by the sting he brings in 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:39.449
 the tail that's why it's called sting kings to 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:43.110
 that blanket stripe and that's what we're going to talk about 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.909
 right now we come back from a cut 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.979
 to talk about the endings of what 

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:50.159
 brings under the chest and especially how it 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:53.749
 handles the new 2014 stingray corvette 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.749
 do not go away now reactions
