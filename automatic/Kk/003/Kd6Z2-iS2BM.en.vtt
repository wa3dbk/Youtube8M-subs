00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 It was good to make a video of you today . 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.099
 terry preparation with three products 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 I bought her a little while but I 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.269
 I have quite loved a cheese you already 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.089
 must have heard that it's a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.580
 Radiant cream of the conciliator of nice this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 product was indication of the popcorn and she 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 said that he was very good at what he 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.189
 gives an illuminated effect 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.900
 I did four five months talking, I'm going 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.420
 buy more a corrective buy will 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.680
 has already been paying off because he has 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.080
 a totally different effect from everything 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 that I have and he is one of those collectives 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 with the illuminator 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 it will leave the illuminated area that is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.590
 something I did not like because I 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 I hate to look like a panda. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.210
 inverted in this because I would find it here 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.739
 she is not normal everyone 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 have a scout so this is one thing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.480
 normal but has a clear part that is not 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 normal I did not use these collectives 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.430
 because actually I did not use and there 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.140
 I learned from this newsletter with cila and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'm using a nice clean baby 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.870
 that he does not baby crime is actually 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.850
 a superleve stage it is pure radiant 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 feel angry because it's from here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 that are still super using are 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.119
 really liking and I just gave up 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.119
 he also because he is very cool to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.560
 My color of this one here Alaska is light 2 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.780
 from here it's vanilla 2 light and I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 I'm also using that powder base 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 that is my color is the montblanc them 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 all sales of the powder analysis have 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.850
 this problem being wiped with a cloth 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.880
 wet they become so horrible and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.070
 Thus it is that raises and you 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.680
 I replied that I used it always applied 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 with a good brush so let's make the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 skin with my three products 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 Preferred 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.799
 this product is that it is very light and it 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.509
 no cover for the night but 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.979
 when I use it along with those with 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 two here he gets a cover 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 very good and you can use it at night in case 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.189
 I'll do a makeup night after 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 here you will see that a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.619
 Good first I'm going to use Uruguayan 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210
 of inter and emotional of da nice and me 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.479
 I will apply all over my skin to use 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.640
 that beauty blender and I'm going to apply 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.040
 He is coming. My face is very yellow. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.719
 You can tell it 's pretty yellow but I 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.610
 I have very red skin line then 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.099
 I always use something hopscotch 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770
 to hide in red in a 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.800
 mechanized, I really like the effect that 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.450
 Give it to me then, I always give 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.680
 prefer things to run from 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.810
 finish pulled to yellow by 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.940
 cause of it personal, so he 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.160
 only half face leak to you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.849
 have a notion of what kobe ​​than he 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:38.099
 does not cover here in the legal organized video 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.680
 He looks like you're not wearing anything at all. 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.239
 It's supernatural but people like that to me are 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.379
 it reminds of the matter makes all the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.700
 difference in skin 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.530
 so I 'll spend the rest of the face 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.360
 his packaging is so i do not like 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.580
 so much so I like deeper is pump 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 because I find it easy but how is it? 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.500
 well liquid a thing that bothers you 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.769
 when to do thick type fixed studio 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 and it's the packaging so I do not want to 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.569
 to use because only work comes to stay 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.580
 the base fall into our very large but it is 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.330
 that until now it is illegal to leave here 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.090
 has fps 30 so you're a good base 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.700
 could even for you already protected 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 in day to day he became very nice with him 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.140
 and now it's time to use the consular agent 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.340
 in areas where I think I need to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.180
 more coverage 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.670
 I will always put in the nose and dark circles 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 at the moment the spine and here in the corner 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.280
 also public on one side only 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.450
 and here the legal corrective always here with 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.120
 because if you apply 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 rubbing he was doing with the base 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 it will completely remove the base that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.540
 I was underneath it it's not cool but it looks 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.420
 only the difference of this collective people this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.239
 collective was the collective type of the year and the a6 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.220
 corrective in my life 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.090
 now I'm mclaren with much more 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.049
 dignity 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.879
 only that radiant believers do not oppose and 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.459
 radiating emotional ink even more 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.620
 it leaves a skin the finish does not 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.239
 sequinho and I like finishing followed 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.489
 because my skin is oily and it stays 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.730
 furious very fast so I like 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.829
 always ending 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.019
 the powder base if you have a good time 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.400
 little it almost does not even cover 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.710
 if you want more coverage there 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.840
 you put more product into the brush and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.190
 more movements on the face to apply 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.050
 as you do not want much coverage or 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.210
 well - type well quickie runway with 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.460
 little good product this is the skin I have 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.720
 used in most everything I do 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.130
 the only thing I sometimes do 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.080
 apply that long net before going to 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.910
 guarantees that everything will improve more 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.070
 but I have been using the skin so almost 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.990
 I am almost always very satisfied with 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.930
 this skin because it is hard for a long time 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.419
 whole and I get a sense of 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.820
 comfort so I really like this skin 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.320
 and analysts for the mind in these three 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.340
 that have been my 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.020
 Preferred 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.639
 Good, I hope you liked the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.260
 skin preparation 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.820
 I'll leave the link for these three products 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.729
 there on the blog for you to know where 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.000
 find these people a kiss and even 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.000
 next
