00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.540 

one<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> most<00:00:19.289> fun<00:00:19.560> features<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.279> warp

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
one of the most fun features of warp

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.599 
one of the most fun features of warp
stabiliser<00:00:21.090> VFX<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.900> its<00:00:22.529> ability<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> analyze

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
stabiliser VFX is its ability to analyze

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000 
stabiliser VFX is its ability to analyze
the<00:00:23.850> motion<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.300> an<00:00:24.390> entire<00:00:24.720> shot<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.380> then

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the motion of an entire shot and then

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.710 
the motion of an entire shot and then
apply<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.340> motion<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> another<00:00:27.449> layer

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
apply that motion to another layer

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.349 
apply that motion to another layer
inside<00:00:28.260> your<00:00:28.439> composition<00:00:29.060> let's<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.240> at

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
inside your composition let's look at

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.060 
inside your composition let's look at
the<00:00:30.449> project<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.170> loaded<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:31.890> now

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

stop<00:00:47.820> playback<00:00:48.110> now<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> sound<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stop playback now I like the sound of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.639 
stop playback now I like the sound of
the<00:00:50.399> board<00:00:50.670> shredding<00:00:51.420> across<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> snow<00:00:52.230> but

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the board shredding across the snow but

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
the board shredding across the snow but
I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> word<00:00:53.670> shredding<00:00:54.210> itself<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I think the word shredding itself is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.650 
I think the word shredding itself is
falling<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.620> flat<00:00:56.030> let's<00:00:57.030> apply<00:00:57.360> warp

happening now when looking at that shot
I<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> camera<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.439> traveling

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I know that the camera was traveling

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
I know that the camera was traveling
along<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> snowboarder<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
along with the snowboarder so I want to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
along with the snowboarder so I want to
make<00:01:31.380> sure<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.740> change<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> result<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
make sure to change the result for the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.260 
make sure to change the result for the
stabilization<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.229> smooth<00:01:34.680> motion<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:36.060> no

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
stabilization from smooth motion to no

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.660 
stabilization from smooth motion to no
motion<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.740> though<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> clip<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> still

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
motion and even though the clip is still

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
motion and even though the clip is still
being<00:01:38.850> analyzed<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.990> make<00:01:40.170> these<00:01:40.320> changes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
being analyzed I can make these changes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
being analyzed I can make these changes
because<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.820> changes<00:01:42.119> won't<00:01:42.600> affect<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
because these changes won't affect the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
because these changes won't affect the
analysis<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:44.189> only<00:01:44.399> affect<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
analysis they only affect the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.469 
analysis they only affect the
stabilization<00:01:46.049> process<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> clip<00:01:47.479> now

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
stabilization process of the clip now

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
stabilization process of the clip now
once<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> stabilize<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.590> been<00:01:49.770> processed

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
once the stabilize has been processed

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
once the stabilize has been processed
you'll<00:01:50.729> notice<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> image<00:01:51.509> looks<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you'll notice the image looks kind of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
you'll notice the image looks kind of
funny<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.579> our<00:01:53.670> framing<00:01:54.060> option

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
funny that's because our framing option

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
funny that's because our framing option
so<00:01:54.930> let's<00:01:54.960> click<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> framing<00:01:55.979> pulldown

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so let's click on the framing pulldown

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.300 
so let's click on the framing pulldown
and<00:01:56.700> change<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> say<00:01:57.630> stabilized<00:01:58.500> only<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and change it to say stabilized only I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
and change it to say stabilized only I
know<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.570> still<00:02:00.810> looks<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.110> little<00:02:01.200> crazy<00:02:01.590> but

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
know it still looks a little crazy but

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
know it still looks a little crazy but
if<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.219> open<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> Advanced<00:02:03.000> section<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:04.020> can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
if we open the Advanced section we can

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.399 
if we open the Advanced section we can
specify<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:05.189> objective<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.810> let's<00:02:07.020> click<00:02:07.259> on

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
specify an objective so let's click on

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.770 
specify an objective so let's click on
the<00:02:07.530> pulldown<00:02:07.770> where<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> says<00:02:08.879> stabilize<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the pulldown where it says stabilize and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.530 
the pulldown where it says stabilize and
change<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> apply<00:02:11.670> motion<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.360> target<00:02:12.840> over

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
change it to apply motion to target over

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
change it to apply motion to target over
now<00:02:15.540> once<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.840> choose<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.260> option<00:02:16.319> there's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
now once you choose that option there's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.070 
now once you choose that option there's
an<00:02:17.340> option<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.910> target<00:02:18.300> layer<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.050> let's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
an option for a target layer so let's

snowboard because I'd like to actually

snowboard because I'd like to actually
use<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.430> movement<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.180> snowboard<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
use the movement of the snowboard to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.500 
use the movement of the snowboard to
determine<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.440> movement<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> graphic

determine the movement of the graphic

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.880 
determine the movement of the graphic
now<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.870> delete<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.290> track<00:03:49.500> points

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
now as you delete the track points

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.560 
now as you delete the track points
you'll<00:03:50.160> notice<00:03:50.579> after<00:03:50.730> effects<00:03:51.390> is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
you'll notice after effects is

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.620 
you'll notice after effects is
reprocessing<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> scene<00:03:52.890> as<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:54.360> move<00:03:54.510> a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
reprocessing the scene as you move a

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.660 
reprocessing the scene as you move a
couple<00:03:54.750> frames<00:03:55.140> down<00:03:55.440> there<00:03:56.040> will<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.310> more

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
couple frames down there will be more

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.670 
couple frames down there will be more
track<00:03:56.970> points<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.510> get<00:03:57.600> applied<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.320> that's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
track points that get applied and that's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.650 
track points that get applied and that's
just<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.549> warp<00:03:59.760> stabiliser<00:04:00.420> is

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
just because the warp stabiliser is

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.289 
just because the warp stabiliser is
picking<00:04:01.079> up<00:04:01.230> new<00:04:01.560> pixels<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.370> can<00:04:02.489> lock<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:03.000> as

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
picking up new pixels it can lock on as

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.530 
picking up new pixels it can lock on as
you<00:04:03.870> continue<00:04:04.350> moving<00:04:04.500> down<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.950> shot

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
you continue moving down the shot

you continue moving down the shot
let's<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.840> keep<00:04:07.049> deleting<00:04:07.620> some<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.950> these

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
let's just keep deleting some of these

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.270 
let's just keep deleting some of these
points<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.079> so<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.709> isn't<00:04:11.130> completely

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280

points now just so this isn't completely
tedious<00:04:12.269> I'm<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.019> keep<00:04:13.140> deleting

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
tedious I'm not going to keep deleting

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.349 
tedious I'm not going to keep deleting
the<00:04:13.739> points<00:04:14.100> moving<00:04:14.370> down<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.760> composition
