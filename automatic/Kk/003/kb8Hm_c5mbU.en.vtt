00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
under and until you get to the bottom of

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.089 
under and until you get to the bottom of
your<00:05:56.069> hair<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.759> then<00:05:57.659> I<00:05:57.870> just<00:05:57.990> kind<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.590> kept

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
your hair and then I just kind of kept

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.070
