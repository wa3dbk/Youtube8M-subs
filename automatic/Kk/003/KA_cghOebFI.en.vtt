came<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.310> 3.8<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.689> produced<00:01:46.340> 311

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
came in a 3.8 which produced 311

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.240 
came in a 3.8 which produced 311
horsepower<00:01:47.840> now<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.740> slightly

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
horsepower now that is down slightly

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
horsepower now that is down slightly
from<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.360> previous<00:01:51.869> model<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.380> Genesis<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
from the previous model in Genesis and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
from the previous model in Genesis and
why<00:01:53.189> would<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.909> well<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> reason

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
why would they do that well the reason

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
why would they do that well the reason
they<00:01:55.470> did<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.820> American

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
they did that was because the American

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.319 
they did that was because the American
market<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.070> Autobahn<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.880> other

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
market is not on the Autobahn in other

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.300 
market is not on the Autobahn in other
words<00:02:00.630> top<00:02:01.049> speed<00:02:01.439> isn't<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
words top speed isn't really that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.480 
words top speed isn't really that
important<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:02.969> much<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.990> low<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.219> mid-range

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
important as much as low to mid-range

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.980 
important as much as low to mid-range
and<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and that's what it has more of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.560 
and that's what it has more of
so<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.800> engine<00:02:10.130> has<00:02:10.340> more<00:02:10.370> power<00:02:10.970> on<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.360> low

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
so the engine has more power on the low

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.080 
so the engine has more power on the low
range<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.110> less<00:02:12.980> power<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.580> high<00:02:13.790> range

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
range and less power on the high range

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.970 
range and less power on the high range
but<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:14.870> not<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.440> affect<00:02:15.530> most

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
but that's not going to affect most

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.700 
but that's not going to affect most
people<00:02:16.400> who<00:02:16.520> drive<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.940> car<00:02:17.440> Hyundai<00:02:18.440> has<00:02:18.680> a

I<00:04:38.680> have<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.070> do<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.340> come<00:04:39.580> down<00:04:39.610> here<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:40.260> the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
I have to do is come down here to the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.860 
I have to do is come down here to the
word<00:04:41.440> sink<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.100> when<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> push<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.419> what

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
word sink and when I push that what

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.620 
word sink and when I push that what
happens<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.620> changes<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.850> passenger<00:04:46.419> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
happens is it changes the passenger and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.180 
happens is it changes the passenger and
synchronizes<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.710> with<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.950> driver

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
synchronizes it with the driver

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.490 
synchronizes it with the driver
temperature<00:04:48.760> that's<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.660> nice<00:04:49.840> feature<00:04:50.110> and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
temperature that's a nice feature and

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.710 
temperature that's a nice feature and
then<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.889> course<00:04:51.490> when<00:04:51.730> you<00:04:51.760> turn<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.090> off<00:04:52.210> then

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
then of course when you turn it off then

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.840 
then of course when you turn it off then
you<00:04:52.990> can<00:04:53.080> manipulate<00:04:53.470> each<00:04:54.430> side

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
you can manipulate each side

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.030 
you can manipulate each side
individually<00:04:55.150> but<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.290> sync<00:04:56.530> feature<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:57.010> a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
individually but the sync feature is a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.690 
individually but the sync feature is a
very<00:04:57.370> easy<00:04:57.729> way<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:59.280> adjust<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> temperature

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
very easy way to adjust the temperature

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.270 
very easy way to adjust the temperature
if<00:05:01.060> you're<00:05:01.240> driving<00:05:01.479> alone<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.979> center

mostly<00:05:14.590> what<00:05:14.860> this<00:05:15.040> is<00:05:15.190> changing<00:05:15.669> is<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
mostly what this is changing is the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.030 
mostly what this is changing is the
suspension<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.280> transmission<00:05:18.600> shift<00:05:19.600> points

the<00:05:21.040> seats

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
the seats

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870 
the seats
are<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:23.110> know<00:05:23.229> heated<00:05:23.680> seats<00:05:23.950> and<00:05:24.190> then<00:05:24.760> you

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
are you know heated seats and then you

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.820 
are you know heated seats and then you
have<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.530> cooled<00:05:26.530> seats<00:05:26.890> nice<00:05:27.640> touch

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
have the cooled seats nice touch

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.110 
have the cooled seats nice touch
everything<00:05:29.830> about<00:05:30.039> this<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.490> very<00:05:30.700> easy<00:05:30.940> you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
everything about this is very easy you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.219 
everything about this is very easy you
get<00:05:31.479> used<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.870> how<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.320> toggles<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:33.520> then

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
get used to how this toggles and then

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.219 
get used to how this toggles and then
sets<00:05:35.700> another<00:05:36.700> really<00:05:37.390> interesting<00:05:37.900> feature

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
sets another really interesting feature

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.550 
sets another really interesting feature
about<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.750> genesis<00:05:40.750> is<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.140> it<00:05:41.289> has<00:05:41.530> a

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
about the genesis is that it has a

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.469 
about the genesis is that it has a
special<00:05:42.520> co2<00:05:43.479> sensor<00:05:44.370> when<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.910> interior

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
special co2 sensor when the interior

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.750 
special co2 sensor when the interior
gets<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:47.020> little<00:05:47.410> high<00:05:47.620> on<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> co2<00:05:48.250> at<00:05:48.729> a

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
gets a little high on the co2 at a

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.260 
gets a little high on the co2 at a
certain<00:05:49.150> point<00:05:49.419> it<00:05:49.830> recognizes<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.039> and<00:05:51.430> it

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
certain point it recognizes that and it

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.379 
certain point it recognizes that and it
shifts<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:53.039> circulation<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:54.220> outside<00:05:54.970> air

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
shifts the circulation to outside air

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.469 
shifts the circulation to outside air
coming<00:05:55.750> in<00:05:56.050> now<00:05:56.680> what<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.070> does<00:05:57.580> is<00:05:58.180> it

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
coming in now what that does is it

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.529 
coming in now what that does is it
allows<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.500> driver<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.070> stay<00:06:00.460> alert<00:06:00.789> co2

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
allows the driver to stay alert co2

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.860 
allows the driver to stay alert co2
levels<00:06:02.200> being<00:06:02.530> too<00:06:02.740> high<00:06:02.979> would<00:06:03.940> make<00:06:04.720> you

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
levels being too high would make you

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.750 
levels being too high would make you
drowsy<00:06:05.169> that's<00:06:05.620> what<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.950> studies<00:06:06.310> show<00:06:06.340> and

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
drowsy that's what the studies show and
