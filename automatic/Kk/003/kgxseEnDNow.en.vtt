00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello let's celebrate the 50 thousand 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.309
 followers on youtube I'm going to make a 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.139
 super easy recipe that you only need 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 strawberries and yogurt 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.700
 I'm going to use a Greek yogurt 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 because it is more exquisite it takes more cream and 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.320
 it gets fatter but you can 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 use a natural yogurt if you want 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.210
 this recipe was very successful on the blog 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.670
 It is also a photogenic because 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.129
 strawberries we cover them with yogurt and they are 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.880
 like strawberry ice creams and 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.950
 yogurt 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.950
 it's very simple you are going to see 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 this yogurt is sweetened but to me 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.539
 like to add a little more sugar 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.289
 all the amount of sugar is to taste 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.890
 If you want, you can also do it with 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.890
 flavored yogurts 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.019
 the strawberries are already washed 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 the ideal is to use strawberries not very 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.950
 large and more or less all of it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.640
 size because what we want is that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 this is a mouthful 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.180
 but I'm very happy for the support that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.790
 You have given me on YouTube since we are 50 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.790
 okay and going up I hope 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 I also love when you tell me 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.159
 art that you make my recipes come out 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.630
 well and we just have to bathe the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.619
 strawberry in yogurt 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.619
 and we leave it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.950
 ideally you can leave them like that but I'll 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 I give a couple of layers because when I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 put in the freezer the draining goes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 a little bit and it stays a little thin if 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.500
 you want you can also use a mold 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 what happens that good so you do not need 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.900
 any kind of utensil you can make 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.030
 as is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 this we are going to let me calculate that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.950
 one hour or so in the freezer 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.050
 and now I'm going to take out the ones I already have 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.180
 prepared from before so you can see how 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.890
 gives you our second layer these are the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.840
 what I've done previously and I just 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.820
 take out of the freezer you see how the yogurt 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.979
 has drained and there are areas that has 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.509
 so it is a very rustic dish and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.430
 I tell you that if you want to do it more 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.320
 you can do it with a 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.320
 mold you see we put them back here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.140
 if you stay short of yogurt you can 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.030
 add more yogurt 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.480
 Even this can also be done 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.209
 with cream or cream to beat and also 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.900
 It would be great if you do not eat all 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.569
 the strawberries from this comes out an ice cream 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.170
 terrific I will take advantage to change 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.170
 the paper that is a little bit dirty 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.790
 we'll have to wait a little bit for 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.180
 that we refreeze and be able to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.180
 eat 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.219
 I leave you with the photos of the cut so that 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.650
 see how pretty the recipe is 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:01.230
 inside and nothing thank you very much everyone for 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.079
 be there at those 50 thousand and a little more 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.260
 and we'll see each other a little kiss until next time 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.260
 bye
