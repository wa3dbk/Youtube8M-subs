new<00:02:23.110> bearings<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.710> everything<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.370> that's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
new bearings and everything so that's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.720 
new bearings and everything so that's

our C Part C you for those um made a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.170 
our C Part C you for those um made a
difference<00:02:32.220> some<00:02:33.220> people<00:02:33.460> are<00:02:33.550> asking<00:02:33.640> where

we're<00:02:34.360> running<00:02:34.720> we're<00:02:34.930> running<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.380> dirt

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
we're running we're running on a dirt

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.870 
we're running we're running on a dirt
oval<00:02:36.010> with<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.400> thing

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
oval with this thing

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.830 
oval with this thing
it's<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.210> rough<00:02:37.420> track<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.960> bit<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> jump

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's a rough track with a bit of a jump

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.480 
it's a rough track with a bit of a jump
this<00:02:40.840> motor<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.350> set<00:02:41.710> up<00:02:41.830> an<00:02:42.070> incredible

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
this motor and set up an incredible

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.740 
this motor and set up an incredible
power<00:02:42.959> running<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> 7.4<00:02:45.010> light<00:02:45.250> bulb

against 7.4 light poles in the Traxxas

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.590 
against 7.4 light poles in the Traxxas
system<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:50.080> thing<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.380> considerably<00:02:51.040> faster

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
system this thing is considerably faster

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.479 
system this thing is considerably faster
we've<00:02:52.600> not<00:02:52.900> even<00:02:53.050> tried<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.620> 11<00:02:53.950> one<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
we've not even tried the 11 one in it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.580 
we've not even tried the 11 one in it
I'm<00:02:55.450> afraid<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> would<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.350> wreck

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
I'm afraid it would just wreck

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.340 
I'm afraid it would just wreck
everything<00:02:56.920> too<00:02:57.520> much<00:02:57.700> power<00:02:58.030> because<00:02:58.930> what's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
everything too much power because what's

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.470 
everything too much power because what's
happening<00:02:59.800> is<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.040> physics<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.790> you've

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
happening is the physics of it you've

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.520 
happening is the physics of it you've
got<00:03:01.690> these<00:03:01.870> huge<00:03:02.200> wheels<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.400> tires<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.600> they

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
got these huge wheels and tires and they

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.960 
got these huge wheels and tires and they
may<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.739> great<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.040> bashing<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
may be great for bashing but on the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.850 
may be great for bashing but on the
racetrack<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.720> too<00:03:07.989> much<00:03:08.140> stress<00:03:08.620> on

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
racetrack it's too much stress on

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.620 
racetrack it's too much stress on
everything<00:03:09.370> look<00:03:09.850> at<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.030> difference<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
everything look at the difference in the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.990 
everything look at the difference in the
size<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.200> between<00:03:11.440> short<00:03:11.830> course<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.430> those

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
size just between short course and those

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.290 
size just between short course and those
and<00:03:13.360> you're<00:03:13.959> 2.2<00:03:14.500> s<00:03:14.800> they're<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> same<00:03:16.000> size

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
and you're 2.2 s they're the same size

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.850 
and you're 2.2 s they're the same size
as<00:03:16.570> these<00:03:16.780> only<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.110> little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:17.440> wider

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
as these only a little bit wider

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.540 
as these only a little bit wider
ok<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:18.610> boy<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> bigger<00:03:19.630> wheels<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.110> tires<00:03:20.550> way

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
ok so boy a bigger wheels and tires way

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.150 
ok so boy a bigger wheels and tires way
more<00:03:21.850> strain<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.480> stress<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:23.110> your<00:03:23.290> parts<00:03:23.739> and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
more strain and stress on your parts and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.740 
more strain and stress on your parts and
as<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> result<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.590> doesn't<00:03:26.980> stand<00:03:27.190> out<00:03:27.540> ok<00:03:28.540> so

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
as a result it doesn't stand out ok so

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.420 
as a result it doesn't stand out ok so
if<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.110> want<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.470> get<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> vehicle<00:03:29.890> just<00:03:30.250> for

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
if you want to get a vehicle just for

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.650 
if you want to get a vehicle just for
fun<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.760> bashing<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.300> you're<00:03:31.420> not<00:03:31.510> gonna

it's way too much work
and<00:03:39.180> even<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:39.930> these<00:03:40.140> parts<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.460> note<00:03:41.580> on

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
and even with these parts just a note on

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.230 
and even with these parts just a note on
the<00:03:41.850> track<00:03:42.440> twice<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:43.830> seriously<00:03:44.700> Racing

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240

C V DS brand-new only you know two runs

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.410 
C V DS brand-new only you know two runs
and<00:03:54.080> that's<00:03:55.080> not<00:03:55.410> boding<00:03:55.890> well<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:57.120> price

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
and that's not boding well for the price

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
I mean you can put a new pin in but hey

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.250 
I mean you can put a new pin in but hey
if<00:03:59.700> it's<00:03:59.850> gonna<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> time

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
if it's gonna do it all the time

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.440 
if it's gonna do it all the time
the<00:04:01.920> only<00:04:02.070> thing<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.430> would<00:04:02.640> suggest<00:04:02.820> if<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.300> do

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the only thing I would suggest if you do

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.480 
the only thing I would suggest if you do
like<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.930> vehicle<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.710> want<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.130> run<00:04:05.310> it

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
like this vehicle and you want to run it

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.910 
like this vehicle and you want to run it
seriously<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.630> know<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.840> can't<00:04:07.260> obviously

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
seriously you know you can't obviously

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.180 
seriously you know you can't obviously
compete<00:04:08.580> out<00:04:09.270> on<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.650> roar<00:04:10.860> tracks

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
compete out on some of the roar tracks

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.010 
compete out on some of the roar tracks
in<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.360> know<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.720> what<00:04:12.840> we're

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
in that but you know for what we're

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.890 
in that but you know for what we're
doing<00:04:13.130> what<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.160> would<00:04:14.490> try<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.090> getting<00:04:15.600> rid<00:04:15.810> of

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
doing what I would try is getting rid of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.190 
doing what I would try is getting rid of
all<00:04:16.049> these<00:04:16.880> wheels<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.060> tires<00:04:18.270> and<00:04:18.600> just

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
all these wheels and tires and just

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.520 
all these wheels and tires and just
going<00:04:19.440> with<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.650> regular<00:04:20.070> 2.2<00:04:20.959> wheel<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.320> maybe

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
going with a regular 2.2 wheel and maybe

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.910 
going with a regular 2.2 wheel and maybe
gladiator<00:04:23.160> tires<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:24.450> think<00:04:25.170> would<00:04:25.320> reduce<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
gladiator tires I think would reduce the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.620 
gladiator tires I think would reduce the
stress<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.550> torque<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:27.000> everything<00:04:27.450> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
stress and the torque on everything and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.660 
stress and the torque on everything and
she<00:04:27.870> probably<00:04:28.140> would<00:04:28.380> run<00:04:28.590> better<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.190> not

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
she probably would run better and not

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.030 
she probably would run better and not
only<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.960> he<00:04:31.140> probably<00:04:31.410> would<00:04:31.860> get

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
only that but he probably would get

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760 
only that but he probably would get
better<00:04:32.250> lap<00:04:32.550> times<00:04:32.970> because<00:04:33.450> these<00:04:34.140> tires<00:04:34.470> are

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
better lap times because these tires are

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.070 
better lap times because these tires are
meant<00:04:34.950> for<00:04:35.040> bashing<00:04:35.670> they're<00:04:36.300> not<00:04:36.570> really<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
meant for bashing they're not really the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.760 
meant for bashing they're not really the
greatest<00:04:37.350> grip<00:04:37.860> on<00:04:38.130> any<00:04:38.670> surface<00:04:39.270> okay<00:04:40.050> we

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
greatest grip on any surface okay we

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.760 
greatest grip on any surface okay we
found<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.160> gladiators<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.090> dirt<00:04:42.660> hogs<00:04:42.930> are

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
found the gladiators and dirt hogs are

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.020 
found the gladiators and dirt hogs are
the<00:04:43.920> best<00:04:44.160> for<00:04:44.400> what<00:04:44.520> we're<00:04:44.700> doing<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:47.030> that's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the best for what we're doing so that's

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.940 
the best for what we're doing so that's
it<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> HP<00:04:49.080> Aria<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:49.500> probably<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
it for the HP Aria that's probably the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.830 
it for the HP Aria that's probably the
last<00:04:50.100> time<00:04:50.460> you're<00:04:50.670> gonna<00:04:50.730> see<00:04:50.850> me<00:04:51.510> do<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> video

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840
