00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
either bring it inside or drain it for

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.070 
either bring it inside or drain it for
the<00:03:28.100> winter<00:03:28.250> months<00:03:28.550> where<00:03:29.450> I'm<00:03:29.570> standing<00:03:29.780> now

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the winter months where I'm standing now

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.240 
the winter months where I'm standing now
it's<00:03:30.320> in<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.470> word<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.740> middle<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.010> summer

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
it's in the word in the middle of summer

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.010 
it's in the word in the middle of summer
so<00:03:31.460> it's<00:03:31.580> actually<00:03:31.850> pretty<00:03:32.000> hot<00:03:32.210> here<00:03:32.480> but

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
so it's actually pretty hot here but

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.450 
so it's actually pretty hot here but
during<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> winter<00:03:33.500> months<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.860> does<00:03:34.040> freeze

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
during the winter months it does freeze

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.280 
during the winter months it does freeze
so<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.240> don't<00:03:35.390> want<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.570> have<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> water<00:03:35.960> balls

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
so I don't want to have the water balls

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.350 
so I don't want to have the water balls
freeze<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.130> then<00:03:37.220> potentially<00:03:37.370> crack<00:03:38.150> or

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
freeze and then potentially crack or

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.720 
freeze and then potentially crack or
split<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:39.500> come<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.860> come<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.370> one<00:03:40.520> day<00:03:40.550> and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
split to come and come in one day and

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.850 
split to come and come in one day and
kind<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.090> mess<00:03:41.300> in<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.540> gym<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.080> when<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.709> does

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
kind of mess in the gym so when it does

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.710 
kind of mess in the gym so when it does
get<00:03:43.070> real<00:03:43.310> cold<00:03:43.640> I'll<00:03:43.880> bring<00:03:44.120> these<00:03:44.300> inside

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
get real cold I'll bring these inside

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.590 
get real cold I'll bring these inside
and<00:03:44.930> put<00:03:45.080> them<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.410> basement<00:03:45.620> just

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
and put them in the basement just

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.060 
and put them in the basement just
something<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.720> consider<00:03:48.230> again<00:03:48.620> if<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:48.950> do

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
something to consider again if you do

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.449 
something to consider again if you do
live<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.430> cold<00:03:49.730> cold<00:03:50.000> climate<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.470> as<00:03:52.190> for

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
live in a cold cold climate so as for

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.699 
live in a cold cold climate so as for
how<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:52.670> use<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:53.240> within<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.870> routine<00:03:54.290> again

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
how you use this within a routine again

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.810 
how you use this within a routine again
it's<00:03:54.830> going<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.010> be<00:03:55.070> something<00:03:55.550> that<00:03:55.580> would<00:03:55.700> be

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
it's going to be something that would be

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.699 
it's going to be something that would be
used<00:03:56.000> similar<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> sandbag<00:03:57.170> could

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
used similar to a sandbag could

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.050 
used similar to a sandbag could
obviously<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.340> used<00:03:58.550> as<00:03:58.670> part<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
obviously be used as part of the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.120 
obviously be used as part of the
strength<00:03:59.360> workout<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.260> could<00:04:00.470> create<00:04:01.040> your

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
strength workout you could create your

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.650 
strength workout you could create your
own<00:04:01.280> medleys<00:04:01.850> where<00:04:02.180> you're<00:04:02.300> maybe<00:04:02.540> carrying

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
own medleys where you're maybe carrying

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.390 
own medleys where you're maybe carrying
it<00:04:03.080> back<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.470> forth<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:04.010> performing

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
it back and forth and performing

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.490 
it back and forth and performing
different<00:04:04.580> exercises<00:04:05.420> at<00:04:05.570> different<00:04:06.170> ends<00:04:06.320> of

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
different exercises at different ends of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.800 
different exercises at different ends of
your<00:04:06.530> stations<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.880> be<00:04:08.000> used<00:04:08.180> as<00:04:08.390> part<00:04:08.570> of<00:04:08.690> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
your stations can be used as part of a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.449 
your stations can be used as part of a
conditioning<00:04:09.380> circuit<00:04:09.860> where<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.100> want<00:04:10.310> to

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
conditioning circuit where you want to

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.800 
conditioning circuit where you want to
include<00:04:10.760> some<00:04:11.360> weight<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.660> resistance

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
include some weight and resistance

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.440 
include some weight and resistance
there's<00:04:12.770> obviously<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.220> lot<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.550> ideas<00:04:14.090> for

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
there's obviously a lot of ideas for

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.400 
there's obviously a lot of ideas for
something<00:04:14.840> as<00:04:14.930> simple

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
something as simple

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.580 
something as simple
and<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.800> so<00:04:16.489> that's<00:04:17.300> it<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.810> as<00:04:17.930> they<00:04:18.290> always

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and this so that's it and as they always

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.410 
and this so that's it and as they always
have<00:04:19.160> any<00:04:19.310> questions<00:04:19.730> about<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.150> or

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
have any questions about this or

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.690 
have any questions about this or
anything<00:04:20.810> else<00:04:21.050> feel<00:04:21.830> free<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.100> email<00:04:22.250> me<00:04:22.580> at
