there's<00:00:24.990> three<00:00:25.230> sensors<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.039> there's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there's three sensors on here there's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
there's three sensors on here there's
one<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> forehead<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> each<00:00:27.810> ear

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
one on the forehead and want to each ear

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.269 
one on the forehead and want to each ear
lobe<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
lobe and what that's going to do is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
lobe and what that's going to do is
that's<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> measure<00:00:29.820> naturally

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that's going to measure naturally

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
that's going to measure naturally
occurring<00:00:30.869> brain<00:00:31.080> waves<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> send<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> signal

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
occurring brain waves and send a signal

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
occurring brain waves and send a signal
to<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.369> device<00:00:32.640> right<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:32.910> which<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.750> turn

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to this device right here which in turn

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
to this device right here which in turn
is<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> create<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> natural<00:00:34.860> stream<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
is going to create a natural stream of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.580 
is going to create a natural stream of
air<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> ball<00:00:36.540> levitate<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
air and make the ball levitate so the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.959 
air and make the ball levitate so the
more<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.770> concentrate<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> ball

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
more you concentrate the more the ball

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.819 
more you concentrate the more the ball
will<00:00:39.120> levitate<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.960> less<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.200> concentrate

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
will levitate the less you concentrate

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
will levitate the less you concentrate
the<00:00:40.950> ball<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.340> fall<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.790> don't<00:00:42.000> drop<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the ball will fall so don't drop the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.290 
the ball will fall so don't drop the
ball<00:00:45.200> okay<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.350> kidding<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.680> catching<00:00:47.100> up

with<00:01:09.880> mattel's<00:01:10.540> mindflex<00:01:11.290> give<00:01:12.070> us<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.310> little

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
with mattel's mindflex give us a little

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.980 
with mattel's mindflex give us a little
background<00:01:12.550> about<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.120> technology<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.870> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
background about the technology of the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.660 
background about the technology of the
game<00:01:14.110> because<00:01:14.229> obviously<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.710> blew<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.310> could

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
game because obviously I blew it I could

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.969 
game because obviously I blew it I could
barely<00:01:15.940> keep<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.420> up<00:01:16.540> who<00:01:17.050> designed<00:01:17.590> this<00:01:17.830> who

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
barely keep it up who designed this who

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.910 
barely keep it up who designed this who
came<00:01:18.160> up<00:01:18.340> with<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.610> idea<00:01:18.820> ok<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:19.780> basically<00:01:20.229> a

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
came up with this idea ok so basically a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.370 
came up with this idea ok so basically a
group<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.550> our<00:01:21.700> designers<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.120> hotel<00:01:22.510> we

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
group of our designers of hotel we

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.810 
group of our designers of hotel we
always<00:01:23.740> are<00:01:23.860> scouring<00:01:24.130> kind<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.610> looking

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
always are scouring kind of looking

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.580 
always are scouring kind of looking
around<00:01:24.910> for<00:01:25.180> what's<00:01:25.390> new<00:01:25.600> what's<00:01:25.900> next<00:01:26.320> what

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
around for what's new what's next what

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.020 
around for what's new what's next what
kind<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.770> technology<00:01:27.280> can<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:27.580> bring<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.940> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
kind of technology can we bring to the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.180 
kind of technology can we bring to the
mainstream<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.410> some<00:01:29.650> guys<00:01:29.800> were<00:01:30.040> at

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
mainstream and so some guys were at

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.280 
mainstream and so some guys were at
electronics<00:01:31.000> show<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.360> few<00:01:31.509> years<00:01:31.750> ago<00:01:32.020> and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
electronics show a few years ago and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.859 
electronics show a few years ago and
they<00:01:32.950> came<00:01:33.220> across<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:34.030> technology<00:01:34.720> with

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
they came across this technology with

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.960 
they came across this technology with
this<00:01:35.020> company<00:01:35.410> called<00:01:35.530> neuro<00:01:35.770> sky<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.430> they

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
this company called neuro sky and they

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.760 
this company called neuro sky and they
were<00:01:37.060> developing<00:01:37.270> basically<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.900> low-cost<00:01:38.410> way

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
were developing basically a low-cost way

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.210 
were developing basically a low-cost way
to<00:01:39.369> use<00:01:39.820> biofeedback<00:01:40.479> as<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.410> mechanism<00:01:41.590> for

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
to use biofeedback as a mechanism for

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.450 
to use biofeedback as a mechanism for
either<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.119> game<00:01:43.450> some<00:01:44.170> sort<00:01:44.410> of<00:01:44.500> product<00:01:45.040> so

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
either a game some sort of product so

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.830 
either a game some sort of product so

rison you know what we're great at

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
rison you know what we're great at
making<00:01:46.990> games<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.100> great<00:01:48.340> technology

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
making games this is a great technology

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.430 
making games this is a great technology
let's<00:01:49.149> figure<00:01:49.509> out<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.690> way<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.899> make<00:01:50.140> kind<00:01:50.380> of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
let's figure out a way to make kind of

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.139 
let's figure out a way to make kind of
the<00:01:50.560> ultimate<00:01:50.950> game<00:01:51.100> where<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.490> can<00:01:51.610> directly

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
the ultimate game where you can directly

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.440 
the ultimate game where you can directly
control<00:01:52.420> with<00:01:52.930> your<00:01:53.080> brain<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.759> object<00:01:55.390> of

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
control with your brain the object of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.880 
control with your brain the object of
the<00:01:55.540> game<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.840> move<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> ball<00:01:56.530> through<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
the game and move the ball through the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.440 
the game and move the ball through the
game<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.340> that's<00:01:57.820> kind<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.060> how<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.180> all<00:01:58.300> came

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
game so that's kind of how it all came

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.610 
game so that's kind of how it all came
up<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.750> then<00:01:58.840> our<00:01:58.960> designers<00:01:59.290> kind<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.500> put

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
up and then our designers kind of put

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.080 
up and then our designers kind of put
the<00:01:59.710> magic<00:02:00.040> together<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.490> how<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:01.000> create

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
the magic together of how do we create

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.550 
the magic together of how do we create
an<00:02:01.270> obstacle<00:02:01.600> course<00:02:01.720> game<00:02:02.140> how<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.409> create

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
an obstacle course game how we create

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.490 
an obstacle course game how we create
excitement<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.250> fun<00:02:03.430> in<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.900> game<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.140> this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
excitement and fun in a game like this

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.750 
excitement and fun in a game like this
that's<00:02:05.740> kind<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.100> people<00:02:06.280> have<00:02:06.370> never<00:02:06.520> seen

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
that's kind of people have never seen

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.490 
that's kind of people have never seen
anything<00:02:06.940> ya<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.780> mean<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.290> definitely

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
anything ya know I mean it's definitely

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.570 
anything ya know I mean it's definitely
new<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.100> unique<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.030> kind<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.310> kind<00:02:12.489> of

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
new and unique and kind of you kind of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.690 
new and unique and kind of you kind of
envision<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:14.019> know<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.290> jetta<00:02:14.700> for

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
envision like you know the jetta for

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.180 
envision like you know the jetta for
sure<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.330> forces<00:02:16.690> riveter<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> mean<00:02:18.160> you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
sure the forces riveter but I mean you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.070 
sure the forces riveter but I mean you
guys<00:02:18.400> are<00:02:18.610> actually<00:02:18.790> taking<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.049> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
guys are actually taking this to the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.710 
guys are actually taking this to the
next<00:02:20.290> level<00:02:20.440> gaming<00:02:21.100> now<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.640> biometrics<00:02:22.480> how

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
next level gaming now the biometrics how

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.090 
next level gaming now the biometrics how
long<00:02:22.989> did<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.260> take<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.769> be

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
long did it take for that to be

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.670 
long did it take for that to be
developed<00:02:24.610> well<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.630> technology<00:02:26.260> itself<00:02:26.350> has

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
developed well the technology itself has

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.750 
developed well the technology itself has
actually<00:02:26.980> been<00:02:27.100> around<00:02:27.190> for<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.580> long<00:02:27.700> time

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
actually been around for a long time

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.520 
actually been around for a long time
it's<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.420> based<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.840> kind<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.170> EEG

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it's really based on kind of EEG

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
it's really based on kind of EEG
technology<00:02:30.310> that's<00:02:30.670> used<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:31.480> know

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
technology that's used you know

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.090 
technology that's used you know
hospitals<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.320> kind<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.590> science<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
hospitals and kind of in science and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.979 
hospitals and kind of in science and
things<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> technology<00:02:34.269> that's<00:02:34.690> behind

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
things so the technology that's behind

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.539 
things so the technology that's behind
it<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.290> kind<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.650> been<00:02:36.010> around<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> long

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
it is kind of been around for a long

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.640 
it is kind of been around for a long
time<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.690> idea<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.019> kind<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.380> bringing<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
time but the idea of kind of bringing it

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.370 
time but the idea of kind of bringing it
12<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.459> sensor<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.390> doesn't<00:02:40.780> need<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.110> jail

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
12 a sensor that doesn't need like jail

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.960 
12 a sensor that doesn't need like jail
or<00:02:41.620> anything<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.220> would<00:02:42.459> never

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
or anything like that that would never

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.250 
or anything like that that would never
for<00:02:43.180> consumer<00:02:43.450> product<00:02:43.750> that's<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.020> new

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
for consumer product that's a new

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.560 
for consumer product that's a new
innovation<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.940> really<00:02:46.300> this

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
innovation and then really this

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.060 
innovation and then really this
technology<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.260> being<00:02:47.500> able<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.740> kind<00:02:47.950> of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
technology of being able to kind of

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.280 
technology of being able to kind of
determine<00:02:48.550> what<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:48.940> concentration<00:02:49.690> or<00:02:50.050> what

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
determine what is concentration or what

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650 
determine what is concentration or what
is<00:02:50.530> relaxation<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:52.120> something<00:02:52.540> that's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
is relaxation that's something that's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.570 
is relaxation that's something that's
new<00:02:52.990> that's<00:02:53.440> been<00:02:53.650> put<00:02:53.800> together<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.400> it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
new that's been put together and so it

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.980 
new that's been put together and so it
was<00:02:54.700> really<00:02:54.820> kind<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.240> bringing<00:02:55.630> those

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
was really kind of just bringing those

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.450 
was really kind of just bringing those
things<00:02:56.260> together<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.740> also<00:02:56.860> bring<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.280> down

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
things together and also bring it down

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.160 
things together and also bring it down
to<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> price<00:02:57.910> where<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.600> could<00:02:58.750> sell<00:02:58.990> this

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to a price where we could sell this

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.020 
to a price where we could sell this
product<00:02:59.440> at<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.710> mass<00:03:00.130> market<00:03:00.370> type<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.820> price
