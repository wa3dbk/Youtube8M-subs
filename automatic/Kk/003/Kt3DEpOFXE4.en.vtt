neck<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.269> fairly

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
neck all right it's fairly

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
neck all right it's fairly
straightforward<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.039> starts<00:00:29.460> right

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
straightforward and it all starts right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.890 
straightforward and it all starts right
off<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> beginning<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
off the beginning here you have a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.179 
off the beginning here you have a
straightaway<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.500> goes<00:00:31.710> through<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
straightaway that goes through the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.620 
straightaway that goes through the
tunnel<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.759> that's<00:00:33.059> why<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> called<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
tunnel and that's why it's called the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.120 
tunnel and that's why it's called the
tunnel<00:00:33.899> twist<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
tunnel twist because you go this way and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
tunnel twist because you go this way and
you<00:00:35.219> come<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> other<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you come back the other way but right

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840 
you come back the other way but right
here<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> where<00:00:37.620> you're<00:00:38.309> running<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> your

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here is where you're running to your

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
here is where you're running to your
first<00:00:39.120> bout<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> contact<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.320> with

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
first bout of contact just because with

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
first bout of contact just because with
the<00:00:40.710> straightaway<00:00:40.980> everyone<00:00:41.910> catching<00:00:42.360> up

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the straightaway everyone catching up

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.729 
the straightaway everyone catching up
everyone's<00:00:42.870> trying<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.559> way<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
everyone's trying to make their way to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
everyone's trying to make their way to
the<00:00:43.890> front<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> pack<00:00:44.430> you're<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.239> going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the front of the pack you're not going

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.549 
the front of the pack you're not going
to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> able<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.320> tunnel

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to be able to get out of this tunnel

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
to be able to get out of this tunnel
without<00:00:46.739> seeing<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> crash<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.640> two<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.000> take

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
without seeing a crash or two so take

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.119 
without seeing a crash or two so take
the<00:00:48.600> crash<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:49.110> ruin<00:00:49.230> anybody<00:00:49.680> else's<00:00:49.980> day

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the crash don't ruin anybody else's day

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
the crash don't ruin anybody else's day
take<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> crash<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> you'll<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.420> able<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
take the crash and you'll be able to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
take the crash and you'll be able to
catch<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> pack<00:00:52.410> next<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.250> comes<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
catch up to the pack next up comes the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.130 
catch up to the pack next up comes the
bottleneck<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.780> helps<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
bottleneck and this is what helps you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
bottleneck and this is what helps you
catch<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.620> um<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.000> exit<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> tunnel

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
catch up um when you exit the tunnel

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.389 
catch up um when you exit the tunnel
you're<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> highway<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> everybody

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you're on the highway and everybody

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
you're on the highway and everybody
basically<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> exit<00:01:01.140> right

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
basically has to take the exit right

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.830 
basically has to take the exit right
there<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.250> lap<00:01:03.239> number<00:01:03.270> one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
there to the right and on lap number one

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
there to the right and on lap number one
especially<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:05.040> always<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> be

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
especially there's always going to be

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
especially there's always going to be
physicality<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.530> impossible<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.130> get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
physicality it's impossible to get

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.230 
physicality it's impossible to get
through<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.610> straight<00:01:08.850> away<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.180> because

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
through this straight away just because

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
through this straight away just because
everyone's<00:01:09.510> catching<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.799> drifts

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
everyone's catching up with those drifts

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.050 
everyone's catching up with those drifts
and<00:01:11.659> as<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.439> contact<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> crazy

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and as you can see the contact is crazy

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
and as you can see the contact is crazy
so<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:15.990> after<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.530> bottleneck<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.250> goes

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so right after the bottleneck it goes

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
so right after the bottleneck it goes
into<00:01:17.640> turn<00:01:17.909> number<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.470> two

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
into turn number one and it's two

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
into turn number one and it's two
90-degree<00:01:20.280> turns<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:22.080> easy<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
90-degree turns it's actually easy to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.600 
90-degree turns it's actually easy to
take<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> slow<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.549> don't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
take you want to slow down you don't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.770 
take you want to slow down you don't
want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> drift<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> other

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
want to drift all the way to the other

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.090 
want to drift all the way to the other
side<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> road<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.619> take<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
side of the road just take it like that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
side of the road just take it like that
nice<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> slowly<00:01:26.970> right<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.750> again<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.049> it's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
nice and slowly right but again if it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
nice and slowly right but again if it's
on<00:01:28.290> lap<00:01:28.470> number<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> create

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
on lap number one it is going to create

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
on lap number one it is going to create
some<00:01:30.479> contact<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.229> after<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> bottleneck

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
some contact just after the bottleneck

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
some contact just after the bottleneck
if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.400> make<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
if you do make it through if you're in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.359 
if you do make it through if you're in
first<00:01:33.990> place<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.470> got<00:01:34.590> someone<00:01:34.920> tight<00:01:35.220> on

your ass you know they're going to run
into<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> contact

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
into the back you so take the contact

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
into the back you so take the contact
again<00:01:38.939> after<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> turn<00:01:40.170> number<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.740> comes

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
again after the turn number one comes

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
again after the turn number one comes
another<00:01:41.220> straight<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.360> into

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
another straight where you go back into

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
another straight where you go back into
the<00:01:42.869> tunnel<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> can

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the tunnel and this is where you can

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.530 
the tunnel and this is where you can
catch<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> rest<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> pack<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
catch up to the rest of the pack so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
catch up to the rest of the pack so
don't<00:01:45.990> worry<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> bottleneck<00:01:46.829> don't

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
don't worry about the bottleneck don't

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
don't worry about the bottleneck don't
worry<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.250> turn<00:01:47.610> number<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.479> the

worry about turn number one use the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
worry about turn number one use the
straightaways<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> catch<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
straightaways to catch back up but

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
straightaways to catch back up but
here's<00:01:50.759> where<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.119> gets<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.689> crazy<00:01:52.320> turn

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
here's where it gets really crazy turn

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.030 
here's where it gets really crazy turn
number<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> 180-degree<00:01:54.990> turn<00:01:55.409> after<00:01:55.740> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and trying to avoid contact right after

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.990 
and trying to avoid contact right after
turn<00:02:25.830> number<00:02:25.980> two<00:02:26.190> comes<00:02:26.459> turn<00:02:26.670> number<00:02:26.880> three

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
turn number two comes turn number three

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.690 
turn number two comes turn number three
same<00:02:27.720> thing<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.739> tight<00:02:28.950> turn<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.430> because

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
same thing it's a tight turn but because

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.760 
same thing it's a tight turn but because
it's<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.180> after<00:02:30.390> turn<00:02:30.750> number<00:02:30.930> two<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.620> can

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it's right after turn number two you can

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's right after turn number two you can
usually<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> lot<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
usually get to it with not a lot of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.430 
usually get to it with not a lot of
people<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.020> are<00:02:34.050> people<00:02:34.410> there

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
people but if there are people there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.830 
people but if there are people there
there<00:02:35.010> will<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.250> contact<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.450> after<00:02:36.810> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
there will be contact right after it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.809 
there will be contact right after it
leads<00:02:37.260> into<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:37.800> bit<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> an<00:02:38.069> S<00:02:38.280> turn<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
leads into a little bit of an S turn and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.250 
leads into a little bit of an S turn and
you<00:02:38.880> want<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.019> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
you want to take it just like that and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.140 
you want to take it just like that and
here's<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> last<00:02:41.069> turn<00:02:41.370> turn<00:02:41.670> number<00:02:42.000> four

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
here's the last turn turn number four

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
here's the last turn turn number four
now<00:02:42.840> there's<00:02:43.050> two<00:02:43.260> ways<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> take<00:02:44.040> turn

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
now there's two ways you can take turn

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.410 
now there's two ways you can take turn
number<00:02:44.459> four<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.000> take<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
number four you can take it on the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
number four you can take it on the
inside<00:02:45.660> lane<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.580> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
inside lane just like this but if you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.979 
inside lane just like this but if you
take<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.819> on<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.030> inside<00:02:48.180> laying<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
take it on the inside laying of with a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.059 
take it on the inside laying of with a
little<00:02:49.260> bit<00:02:49.350> too<00:02:49.440> much<00:02:49.560> speed<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.920> might

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
little bit too much speed you might

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.590 
little bit too much speed you might
drift<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.819> lose<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.209> speed

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
drift like that and lose all your speed

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.000 
drift like that and lose all your speed
right<00:02:51.870> here's<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.620> want<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.890> if

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
right here's what you want to do if
