00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.929
 hello it technically reviews 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.349
 lab he and with you i'm mikhail today 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.589
 we talk about a company that 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.859
 started as a manufacturer 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.880
 photographic films 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.669
 now this company is known to us 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.970
 their household and professional 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 quota camcorders powerful processor 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.119
 Ameriks Morgue Branded Optics and 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.369
 dinner he 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 it all applies brand worst movie 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.529
 but until today's review such notions 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 like a megapixel matrix doesn't matter 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.270
 Today we have a review 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790
 camera 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 who can take pictures 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.180
 model name right there iniesta movie to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.990
 shift 25 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.070
 it would seem that the Permian Polaroids had already gone 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.030
 however, now more than ever products 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 is in demand not only in Japan where 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 number of devices sold 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.240
 in the thousands 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.540
 but in Russia the idea is no less popular 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.810
 service programs 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.570
 where can I get a photo of a similar 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.330
 qualities 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.920
 without digital processing 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 so watching the model it is made closer from 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690
 simple glossy plastic and design 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.400
 devices attracting glances 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 and still this device looks 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 interesting 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 located on the front panel 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.900
 lens 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 flash 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 viewfinder 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 their shutter button 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.270
 and by the way these buttons are as much as 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.220
 two 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.540
 one located on the front 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 another up 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.229
 that is, you can take pictures in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.570
 most comfortable for you 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.830
 conditions 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 for example so 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.310
 there is a cover on the back panel 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.620
 where is the photo of the papers 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.430
 but to open 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.750
 if that circle tons of switches 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.030
 forcing the lid to hide two 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.520
 batteries 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.260
 in this case panasonic 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.740
 A format of the battery PCR 2 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 management reading 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.900
 the red button turns on itself 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.500
 device 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.700
 one of two dynamo buttons where you see 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.680
 on uks when uvd means you 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.400
 you can take a photo or more 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.510
 bright or darker 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.190
 the second key is responsible for the flash 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.130
 i.e. matching if nothing here 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 not specified to work automatically mode 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.090
 such flour burns 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 This means that the flash will be 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.489
 forced 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.249
 and if it burns 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.079
 such gifts icon 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.909
 who uses shooting mode 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.189
 landscapes 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.419
 and on the right side of this infertility 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.479
 they are located decanter amount 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.269
 remaining shots 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.489
 Well, above all this is a gap through 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.299
 which is just coming out our favorite 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.549
 church 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.150
 in order to start shooting we must 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.900
 install this tape here 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.199
 camera 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.379
 in this case we have water 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 however, the network has 10 shots 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.049
 So exactly arranged according to the principle 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.129
 known to be located 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.290
 self-esteem is the heart that is to us 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.019
 will be required in order to 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.439
 to take a photo 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.049
 and so to properly install this 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.919
 tape need to combine two yellow 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.849
 stripes 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.159
 present 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.809
 clip close 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.699
 now in order for cameras to start shooting 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.869
 should turn on the power 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.869
 and press 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.399
 now we have a camera ready for work 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.059
 There are a number of pictures that 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.569
 can do 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 but now we will make it difficult 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.189
 because the process has started 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.129
 which takes time to 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.719
 and now a few minutes later 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.059
 get a snapshot 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.939
 percent 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.639
 snapshot size was 86 by 50 4 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.749
 millimeter 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.620
 Essentially very similar to children card 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.989
 its size 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.290
 to operate the apparatus according to the principle 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.619
 famous Polaroids 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:51.929
 after clicking the shutter the light hits 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.539
 special fund paper 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.129
 and after a while photos 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.569
 begins to manifest 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.429
 few minutes and photos ready 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:59.859
 magic and only 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.759
 complete with optics 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.549
 for close up shots ie 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.789
 given away the camera using a diet lens 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.889
 capable of making copies from typical to 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.369
 fifty with these 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.179
 without a visa, the device is able to shoot on 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.019
 50 centimeters and more 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.359
 index less than 25 thanks 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.400
 food film company practices in the field 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.160
