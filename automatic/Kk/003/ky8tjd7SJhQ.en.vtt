paste<00:02:19.220> tend<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.670> stick<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> bottom<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.569> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
paste tend to stick to the bottom so you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.830 
paste tend to stick to the bottom so you
got<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> constant<00:02:21.319> stirring<00:02:22.599> because<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
got a constant stirring because of the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.110 
got a constant stirring because of the
water<00:02:24.050> content<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.550> does<00:02:25.730> tend<00:02:26.030> to

water content it do it does tend to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.559 
water content it do it does tend to
splatter<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.920> got<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.390> stir<00:02:29.390> it
