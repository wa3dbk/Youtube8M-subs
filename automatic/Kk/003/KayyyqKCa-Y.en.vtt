 So first of all in these two models 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 What has brought 2 5 is here different from now? It has it is here 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.050
 These two car models are quite easy to compare with his range 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.050
 I think that like so let's go 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 me 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.809
 a The first thing to notice first is the emblem 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.809
 The emblem is written here as r 3 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.860
 Here is r 25 I think 50 ans 5 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.010
 Basically, the only visual distinction is on this side 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.960
 Look closely go and a here. 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.739
 Speedometer 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 In fact r 3 is a red phone 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 Well about 500 turns around yes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 My mother is taking frozen food 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.290
 who r 25 is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 I would like to compare with a little bit 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.630
 Up to about 14000 revolutions 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:31.259
 Much there and I such of the Well about 2000 rotation 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:37.259
 Modosaipu more of r 2 5 is to earn in here is pretty rotates at high rotation type is I Nano 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.680
 Efforts is there another exhaust amount and the split in terms How to put out of such I will try ne r 3 of the power of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.659
 I feel like you are running in 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.360
 That's a big difference It's a tire 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 This one is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.410
 r If you have five children, one speed child is low 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.320
 It comes with a tire of up to about 180 kilometers ne 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.890
 Here 's a response of up to 210 kg for r3 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.830
 Because it is attached to here because it is a little 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.420
 I get a sporty impression 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:12.610
 Cormorant is here in you can mailer another Michelin 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.610
 r 2 5 is Inoue irc is attached, it feels like that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.350
 Then I would like to compare engines 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 Try a little over towards the 250 parent-child I do not know what can be seen in this, but 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.700
 It has a little over 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.680
 It looks like this familiar 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.580
 It is an impression that it is a person who is very light and well 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.660
 It is thick of today have to clear it was found 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.750
 I do not know a little or was sound to where it is a camera is wide but doing this kind 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.930
 It is compared with 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.049
 Again yeah it is very sound itself is lower here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.269
 Sound of thick feeling sounds after all 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.269
 Would not it the difference of you that it is roughly the 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.610
