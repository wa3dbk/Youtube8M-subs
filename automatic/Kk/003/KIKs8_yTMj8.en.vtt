the first time so if a driver goes into

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
the first time so if a driver goes into
the<00:00:59.640> bus<00:00:59.789> lane<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.930> ticketed

the bus lane they will be ticketed

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
the bus lane they will be ticketed
automatically<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.280> addition<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.449> left

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
automatically in addition on the left

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.060 
automatically in addition on the left
side<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> street<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
side of the street there will be a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
protected bike lane from Houston Street
to<00:01:07.560> 34th<00:01:08.040> Street<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> really<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to 34th Street so this is really the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
to 34th Street so this is really the
largest<00:01:09.570> multimodal<00:01:10.380> transportation

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
largest multimodal transportation

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
largest multimodal transportation
corridor<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> nation<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:12.360> eight<00:01:12.750> point

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
corridor in the nation now eight point

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.859 
corridor in the nation now eight point
five<00:01:13.350> miles<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.040> First<00:01:14.549> Avenue<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.630> same

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
five miles on First Avenue and the same

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
five miles on First Avenue and the same
down<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.350> Second<00:01:16.740> Avenue<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.880> part

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
down on Second Avenue it's really part

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
down on Second Avenue it's really part
of<00:01:18.240> Mayor<00:01:18.420> Bloomberg's<00:01:18.960> plan<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.500> bring

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
of Mayor Bloomberg's plan to bring

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
of Mayor Bloomberg's plan to bring
world-class<00:01:20.220> streets<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> world-class

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
world-class streets and world-class

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
world-class streets and world-class
commuting<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> world-class<00:01:22.770> City<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
commuting to a world-class City this is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
commuting to a world-class City this is
the<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:24.090> step<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.170> trying<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.560> make

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the first step in really trying to make

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.710 
the first step in really trying to make
bus<00:01:25.920> lanes<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.430> buses<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bus lanes for buses and I think it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
bus lanes for buses and I think it
really<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> most<00:01:28.470> important<00:01:29.009> part<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
really is the most important part of it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
really is the most important part of it
a<00:01:29.610> select<00:01:30.030> bus<00:01:30.329> service<00:01:30.360> route<00:01:30.869> includes<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
a select bus service route includes a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
a select bus service route includes a
package<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.250> transportation<00:01:33.119> innovations

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
package of transportation innovations

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.719 
package of transportation innovations
that<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> easier<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.250> bus<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> get

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that make it easier for the bus to get

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
that make it easier for the bus to get
through<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.450> transportation<00:01:37.170> network<00:01:37.290> so

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
through the transportation network so

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
through the transportation network so
what<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> includes<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> dedicated<00:01:39.299> bus<00:01:39.600> line

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
what it includes is a dedicated bus line

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.050 
what it includes is a dedicated bus line
it<00:01:40.290> also<00:01:40.470> includes<00:01:41.040> transit<00:01:41.759> signal

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it also includes transit signal

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
it also includes transit signal
prioritization<00:01:42.570> which<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> basically<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
prioritization which is basically a
