00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.030
 good afternoon today we will consider 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.490
 onboard computer capabilities on 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.640
 nissan almera to determine how much 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.789
 left in the gas tank 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.070
 do the following for this we 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.670
 turn the key one position here 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.439
 like kind of earned the stove then we 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.129
 by hand 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:36.010
 click on the odonometer that's here 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.800
 located 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.699
 press literally three seconds and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.080
 turn it on and keep it up to those 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:51.100
 until this number lights up 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:55.610
 now we see this firmware number and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:00.039
 Now see how these arrows ran the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.039
 there is a complete diagnosis of the motor 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.960
 now he's diagnosing everything and also 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.840
 Now the dealer can easily identify immediately 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.380
 what 's the firmware 81 402 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.160
 which are installed to the plant, let's see 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.810
 so my camcorders turn on for 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.690
 they are also visible so what are we doing next 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.780
 we need to determine how much is real 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 fuel we have left in the tank for this 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.100
 we press one more time well now we 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.110
 pressed 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.960
 This he shows the that on that on that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.090
 he is capable that is all that is possible there 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.009
 light up so it is necessary to bring that is 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.409
 we see all the numbers of you that he 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.569
 able to back 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.640
 so now it shows the following 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.569
 tanks left 44 liters 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.520
 that is, we ourselves can really understand 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:05.920
 how many muse gas tank and what we 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.789
 count further in this computer 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 there is one more function we push one more 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:18.640
 times and here it will show real 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.280
 fuel consumption just specific how much 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.099
 she spends the fact that the arrows run 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.329
 this is a normal auntie you have no elder 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:34.080
 next we start the car here started the car 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.260
 it is warm with us 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.860
 and how to show approximately how much she 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.660
 liters consumes at the moment but how 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.910
 rule if warmed up car will show 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.180
 zero zero the movie and 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.360
 but if well warmed up and here we are 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 start driving at first speed here 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.720
 he shows on immediately the expense went 2 and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.310
 2 liters 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 there 1 and 9 . dropped everything fell nothing 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 costs 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:16.120
 further more feasible price then pruned already 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.120
 on this little just here and here we are 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 stood back to see the position he 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.870
 shows 0 as if shows 0 that is 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 the car is dark because a little there 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.250
 add there because it shows that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.850
 if in this position it will be more 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.290
 costs also see here 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.750
 monitor light hare so talk you 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 turned off but twisted they twisted 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:50.140
 turned on and so on we care 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.100
 just turn off the car and let a bunch 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.890
 they all went back to us 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.980
 standard this here it shows 85 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.220
 kilometers did not drive there 12 retro 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.730
 will consume 14 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.050
 some show - offs in the community are clear and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.190
 refueling show three hundred 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.290
 fourteen kilometers 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.510
 which does not always correspond 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:20.500
 Actually, in principle, here 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.110
 I run three four hundred same principle 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.150
 I would also like that everyone 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.940
 Wrote what firmware will not stand because 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:35.010
 that time does not stand still and the plant itself 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.010
 on the new firmware all these machines
