looks great lots of additional detail in
the<00:00:17.850> environments<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:19.529> bring<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> all

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the environments really bring it all

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.359 
the environments really bring it all
together<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.880> terms<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:22.170> look<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.560> feel

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.480 

we<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> massive<00:00:27.390> carnage<00:00:27.900> on

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
we get through that massive carnage on

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.299 
we get through that massive carnage on
turn<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:31.349> always<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> battle<00:00:32.130> there

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
turn one it's always a battle there

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
turn one it's always a battle there
because<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> slow<00:00:33.000> corner<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.630> come

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
because it's a slow corner they come

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
because it's a slow corner they come
piling<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> many<00:00:35.940> cars<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.800> detail<00:00:38.070> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
piling in so many cars so much detail so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.580 
piling in so many cars so much detail so
much<00:00:38.850> body<00:00:39.090> damage<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.750> yet<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> graphics

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
much body damage in yet the graphics

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
much body damage in yet the graphics
engine<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.070> handling<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:42.510> nicely<00:00:42.719> at

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
engine is handling it really nicely at

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
engine is handling it really nicely at
this<00:00:43.140> stage<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.950> thing<00:00:44.250> has<00:00:44.370> been<00:00:44.520> refined

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this stage and thing has been refined

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
this stage and thing has been refined
and<00:00:45.059> improved<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.780> notice<00:00:46.020> little<00:00:46.230> corners

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and improved you notice little corners

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
and improved you notice little corners
like<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.789> car<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> little

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
like that one the car just has a little

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
like that one the car just has a little
bit<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:48.960> tactile<00:00:49.620> feedback<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.300> still

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bit more tactile feedback now it's still

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
bit more tactile feedback now it's still
very<00:00:51.660> tricky<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.230> slow<00:00:52.500> corners<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.160> then

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
very tricky in the slow corners but then

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
very tricky in the slow corners but then
we're<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.520> driving<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> most<00:00:54.210> versatile<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we're not driving the most versatile of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.490 
we're not driving the most versatile of
cars<00:00:55.260> has<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.920> said<00:00:56.750> these<00:00:57.750> cars<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.320> have

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
cars has to be said these cars will have

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
cars has to be said these cars will have
a<00:00:58.559> sloppy<00:00:58.980> style<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.149> click<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
a sloppy style to them just click the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
a sloppy style to them just click the
tires

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
tires

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
tires
got<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> wheel<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> grass<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.979> isn't

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
got a wheel on the grass but this isn't

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.760 
got a wheel on the grass but this isn't
about<00:01:05.339> clean<00:01:05.820> racing<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:07.020> maximizing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
about clean racing it's about maximizing

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
about clean racing it's about maximizing
what<00:01:08.280> you've<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:08.940> probably

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
what you've got and I've probably

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
what you've got and I've probably
already<00:01:09.330> sustained<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> damage<00:01:10.590> here

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
already sustained a bit of damage here

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
already sustained a bit of damage here
in<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:12.180> don't<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> damage

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
in there you don't see the damage

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
in there you don't see the damage
obviously<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.470> much<00:01:13.710> from<00:01:13.950> inside<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> car

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
obviously so much from inside the car

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
obviously so much from inside the car
come<00:01:15.030> around<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> final<00:01:15.540> corner<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:16.170> was

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
come around the final corner that was

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
come around the final corner that was
flat<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.680> easily<00:01:16.979> before<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
flat out easily before but now it's a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.410 
flat out easily before but now it's a
little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.780> tricky<00:01:18.990> depending<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
little bit more tricky depending on the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
little bit more tricky depending on the
performance<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.690> car<00:01:21.899> you<00:01:22.649> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
performance of your car you can see the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
performance of your car you can see the
cockpit<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:25.280> he's<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.399> slightly

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cockpit can he's actually slightly

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
cockpit can he's actually slightly
damaged<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> car<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> damaged<00:01:28.140> too<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.440> she

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
damaged the car is damaged too so she

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
damaged the car is damaged too so she
moved<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.210> see

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
moved it in a bit there so he can see

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
moved it in a bit there so he can see
see<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.920> side<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> car<00:01:32.310> has<00:01:32.580> some<00:01:32.759> has

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
see that side of the car has some has

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.800 
see that side of the car has some has
been<00:01:33.180> squashed<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:35.789> we<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> dent<00:01:36.360> in

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
been squashed in and we have a dent in

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.420 
been squashed in and we have a dent in
our<00:01:36.990> left<00:01:37.440> side

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.039 

coming<00:01:41.430> round

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
coming round

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
coming round
again<00:01:43.680> though<00:01:43.859> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.219> very<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:45.090> an

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
again though this is a very much an

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.950 
again though this is a very much an
experimentation<00:01:46.109> or<00:01:46.380> driving<00:01:46.679> style<00:01:47.960> driving

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
experimentation or driving style driving

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
experimentation or driving style driving
as<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.289> before<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.009> trying<00:01:50.369> different

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
as I was before but trying different

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.410 
as I was before but trying different
gears<00:01:52.399> sometimes<00:01:53.399> I'll<00:01:53.579> shift<00:01:53.789> up<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.179> gear

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
gears sometimes I'll shift up the gear

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
gears sometimes I'll shift up the gear
down<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> gear<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.469> earlier<00:01:55.829> depending<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
down a gear a bit earlier depending I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.450 
down a gear a bit earlier depending I
came<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.509> across<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:58.259> avoid<00:01:58.530> him

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.279 

didn't<00:02:02.060> want<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.270> damage<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.570> front<00:02:02.899> end<00:02:03.140> too

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
didn't want to damage the front end too

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.490 
didn't want to damage the front end too
much<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.679> can<00:02:03.920> end<00:02:04.159> up<00:02:04.280> with<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:05.500> opponent

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
much you can end up with the opponent

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.580 
much you can end up with the opponent

fold it up you can't see where you're
going<00:02:11.780> very<00:02:12.050> well<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.530> did<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> whole<00:02:12.920> race

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
going very well so I did a whole race

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.290 
going very well so I did a whole race
where<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:13.730> couldn't<00:02:13.970> see<00:02:14.090> where<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.269> was

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
where I just couldn't see where I was

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300 
where I just couldn't see where I was
going<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.900> worked<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.680> changing<00:02:16.099> view

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
going but it worked I'm changing view

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
going but it worked I'm changing view
now<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.849> was<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.209> for<00:02:17.390> video<00:02:17.599> purposes<00:02:17.900> I

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
now this was just for video purposes I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.780 
now this was just for video purposes I
just<00:02:18.650> learned<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:18.920> over<00:02:19.129> everybody<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.670> new

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
just learned this over everybody the new

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.089 
just learned this over everybody the new
environments<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.599> final<00:02:21.019> corner<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
environments on the final corner and you

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.770 
environments on the final corner and you
can<00:02:22.280> really<00:02:22.489> see<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> detail<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.390> your<00:02:23.480> more

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
can really see the detail and your more

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.449 
can really see the detail and your more
refine<00:02:24.110> textures<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.799> lighting<00:02:24.950> here

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
refine textures and lighting here

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
to see the speed of development on this

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.940 
to see the speed of development on this
from<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.420> developers<00:02:33.049> kind<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.709> come<00:02:33.829> out

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
