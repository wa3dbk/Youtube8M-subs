00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
space for like a loyalty cards so let me

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
space for like a loyalty cards so let me
just<00:01:53.430> show<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.390> basically<00:01:54.570> an

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just show you that it's basically an

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
just show you that it's basically an
insert<00:01:55.259> slip<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.860> obviously<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
insert slip so obviously you have to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
insert slip so obviously you have to
hook<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.240> push<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
hook it out and then push it in so it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.959 
hook it out and then push it in so it
doesn't<00:01:58.649> actually<00:01:59.040> add<00:01:59.340> anything<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
doesn't actually add anything to the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
doesn't actually add anything to the
case<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.329> well<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> great<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.229> will

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
case as well which is great and i will

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
case as well which is great and i will
also<00:02:01.530> try<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.979> once<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> phone<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
also try it once the phone is in the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
also try it once the phone is in the
case<00:02:03.810> also<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.399> i<00:02:05.460> said<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
now in the case so like I said I'll just

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.150 
now in the case so like I said I'll just
want<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> try<00:02:40.510> out<00:02:40.780> with<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.620> card<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.130> the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
want to try out with the the card in the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.210 
want to try out with the the card in the
insert<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> inside<00:02:43.959> cover<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.590> close<00:02:44.890> up

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
insert in the inside cover and close up

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.500 
insert in the inside cover and close up
so<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.610> can<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.880> there<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.150> doesn't<00:02:46.390> add

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
so as you can see there it doesn't add

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.710 
so as you can see there it doesn't add
any<00:02:46.720> bulk<00:02:46.750> or<00:02:47.620> any<00:02:47.860> weight<00:02:48.160> really<00:02:48.730> obviously

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
any bulk or any weight really obviously

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.479 
any bulk or any weight really obviously
it<00:02:49.900> probably<00:02:50.200> does<00:02:50.350> feel<00:02:50.650> nice<00:02:50.860> without<00:02:51.130> it

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
it probably does feel nice without it

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.100 
it probably does feel nice without it
but<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.300> whole<00:02:52.420> point<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.780> having<00:02:52.870> that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
but the whole point of having that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.630 
but the whole point of having that
insert<00:02:53.530> slip<00:02:53.830> there<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> make<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.459> feel

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
insert slip there is to make you feel

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.910 
insert slip there is to make you feel
comfortable<00:02:54.820> even<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.630> card<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.739> once

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
comfortable even with a card in so once

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.699 
comfortable even with a card in so once
you<00:02:57.040> close<00:02:57.220> up<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:58.239> doesn't<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.230> mean
