00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
really like the r version here in in the
united<00:01:47.009> states<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.790> tend<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.299> at

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
united states because we tend to work at

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.630 
united states because we tend to work at
a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.840> looser<00:01:49.200> traction<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
a little looser traction and so the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
a little looser traction and so the
we've<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.180> found<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> plastic

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
we've actually found that the plastic

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
we've actually found that the plastic
slide<00:01:52.860> guards<00:01:53.189> allows<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> little

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
slide guards allows it to have a little

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
slide guards allows it to have a little
more<00:01:54.420> flexibility<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> great<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
more flexibility which is great for a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
more flexibility which is great for a
lot<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> common<00:01:57.240> tracks<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.079> great

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
lot of the common tracks here so great

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319 
lot of the common tracks here so great
so<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:58.950> racing<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> US<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so if you're here racing in the US you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.850 
so if you're here racing in the US you
might<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.869> actually<00:02:00.960> purchase<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.649> less

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
might want to actually purchase the less

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.910 
might want to actually purchase the less
expensive<00:02:02.189> DX<00:02:02.729> 410<00:02:03.180> versus<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.770> has

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
expensive DX 410 versus the one that has

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.020 
expensive DX 410 versus the one that has
all<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> hop<00:02:05.399> ups<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> bling<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
all the hop ups all the bling that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.510 
all the hop ups all the bling that
racers<00:02:06.780> typically<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> want

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
racers typically want but if you want

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.309 
racers typically want but if you want
traction<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.629> might<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.929> into<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> less

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
traction you might go into a less

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
traction you might go into a less
expensive<00:02:10.619> option

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
expensive option

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.880 
expensive option
note<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.480> nice<00:02:12.659> thing<00:02:12.689> about<00:02:12.959> these<00:02:13.409> being

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
note is the nice thing about these being

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
note is the nice thing about these being
a<00:02:14.189> hundred<00:02:14.459> percent<00:02:14.640> cross<00:02:15.150> compatibility<00:02:16.019> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
a hundred percent cross compatibility is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.530 
a hundred percent cross compatibility is
no<00:02:16.319> matter<00:02:16.530> which<00:02:16.859> version<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.579> by<00:02:17.790> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
no matter which version you do by you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.500 
no matter which version you do by you
can<00:02:18.749> either<00:02:19.530> downgrade<00:02:20.069> or<00:02:20.219> upgrade<00:02:20.609> or<00:02:20.879> tune

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
can either downgrade or upgrade or tune

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.569 
can either downgrade or upgrade or tune
I<00:02:21.780> guess<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.409> say<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.189> upgrades

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
I guess you can say for the upgrades

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.220 
I guess you can say for the upgrades
from<00:02:23.790> plastic<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.299> aluminum<00:02:24.749> a<00:02:24.840> lot<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.079> guys

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
from plastic to aluminum a lot of guys

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
from plastic to aluminum a lot of guys
will<00:02:25.560> purchase<00:02:25.889> they<00:02:26.249> are<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.719> but<00:02:27.719> you<00:02:27.840> know

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
will purchase they are and but you know

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.449 
will purchase they are and but you know
some<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> alumina<00:02:28.769> upgrades<00:02:29.069> they<00:02:29.250> feel

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
some of the alumina upgrades they feel

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.819 
some of the alumina upgrades they feel
necessary<00:02:30.090> or<00:02:30.329> go<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.930> arbors<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.739> then

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
necessary or go to the arbors and then

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.349 
necessary or go to the arbors and then
maybe<00:02:32.010> even<00:02:32.159> goes<00:02:32.370> side<00:02:32.670> guards<00:02:32.939> get<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> little

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
maybe even goes side guards get a little

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.000 
maybe even goes side guards get a little
more<00:02:33.480> flex<00:02:33.689> on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> chassis<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.650> makes<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
more flex on the chassis that makes a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.559 
more flex on the chassis that makes a
lot<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.189> sense<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.790> start<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.389> you

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
lot of sense so if you start here you

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.629 
lot of sense so if you start here you
can<00:02:37.109> bolt<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.409> some<00:02:37.590> hop<00:02:37.769> ups<00:02:38.010> how<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> feel

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
can bolt on some hop ups how you feel

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.069 
can bolt on some hop ups how you feel
