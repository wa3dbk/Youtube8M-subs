variations through the year models but

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.570 
variations through the year models but
the<00:00:26.970> same<00:00:27.970> plenum<00:00:28.390> box<00:00:28.630> was<00:00:28.900> used<00:00:29.230> on<00:00:29.529> all<00:00:30.189> of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
the same plenum box was used on all of

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.180 
the same plenum box was used on all of
the<00:00:31.349> RAM<00:00:32.349> 1500<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.340> 3500<00:00:35.070> trucks<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.610> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the RAM 1500 to 3500 trucks so the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.500 
the RAM 1500 to 3500 trucks so the
plastics<00:00:39.190> may<00:00:39.370> look<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.699> little<00:00:39.730> different<00:00:39.970> but

get it pulled off you know we'll get
down<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.890> point<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:18.579> sure<00:03:18.640> by<00:03:19.000> now

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
down to this point I'm sure by now

down to this point I'm sure by now
you're<00:03:19.420> asking<00:03:19.840> yourself<00:03:20.260> why<00:03:21.100> did<00:03:21.280> Dodge<00:03:21.459> use

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
you're asking yourself why did Dodge use

you're asking yourself why did Dodge use
so<00:03:22.090> many<00:03:22.239> screws<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.290> put<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:23.680> thing

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
so many screws to put this thing

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.949 
so many screws to put this thing
together<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.670> I'll<00:03:25.390> answer<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.780> question

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
together and I'll answer that question

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.759 
together and I'll answer that question
for<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.860> hell<00:03:27.579> if<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.910> know<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.500> you've<00:03:29.620> got

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
for you hell if I know but you've got

for you hell if I know but you've got
them<00:03:29.860> all<00:03:30.040> out<00:03:30.280> now<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.910> things<00:03:31.810> should<00:03:32.110> go<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
them all out now so things should go a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.949 
them all out now so things should go a
lot<00:03:32.560> smoother<00:03:33.010> from<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.370> point<00:03:33.640> on<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.810> let

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
lot smoother from this point on so let

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.560 
lot smoother from this point on so let
me<00:03:35.049> do<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> little<00:03:35.410> more<00:03:35.620> disassembly<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.760> then

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
me do a little more disassembly and then

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.539 
me do a little more disassembly and then
we'll<00:03:37.840> start<00:03:38.620> looking<00:03:38.739> at<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.190> different

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
we'll start looking at the different

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.240 
we'll start looking at the different
actuator<00:03:40.000> motors<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:41.350> you're<00:03:41.560> starting<00:03:42.040> to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
actuator motors that you're starting to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.220 
actuator motors that you're starting to
see<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.239> start<00:03:43.750> doing<00:03:44.049> some<00:03:44.230> debug<00:03:46.230> first

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
see now and start doing some debug first

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.720 
see now and start doing some debug first
thing<00:03:47.410> we're<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.859> do<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.310> take<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> look

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
thing we're going to do is take a look

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.670 
thing we're going to do is take a look
at<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> research<00:03:49.299> door<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.410> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
at the research door and this is on the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.300 
at the research door and this is on the
far<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.670> hand<00:03:51.700> side<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.630> dash<00:03:52.840> panel

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
far right hand side of the dash panel

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.670 
far right hand side of the dash panel
above<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.489> passenger<00:03:54.760> side<00:03:55.299> floorboards<00:03:56.260> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
above the passenger side floorboards and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.130 
above the passenger side floorboards and
I'm<00:03:57.670> not<00:03:57.880> sure<00:03:58.030> how<00:03:58.209> good<00:03:58.269> you'll<00:03:58.600> see<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.930> on

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
I'm not sure how good you'll see this on

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.880 
I'm not sure how good you'll see this on
the<00:03:59.200> video<00:03:59.410> but<00:03:59.620> you<00:04:00.040> can<00:04:00.070> see<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:01.230> air<00:04:02.230> intake

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the video but you can see the air intake

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.160 
the video but you can see the air intake
opening<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.940> for<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.269> internal<00:04:04.750> intake

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
opening this is for the internal intake

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.710 
opening this is for the internal intake
and<00:04:05.470> see<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> door<00:04:06.370> behind<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.570> is

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
and see the door behind it this one is

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.690 
and see the door behind it this one is
real<00:04:07.959> easy<00:04:08.290> because<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.829> touched<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.609> it

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
real easy because I touched that and it

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.690 
real easy because I touched that and it
just<00:04:09.940> bounces<00:04:10.780> back<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.590> forth<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.220> we<00:04:12.250> are

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
just bounces back and forth so we are

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.520 
just bounces back and forth so we are
definitely<00:04:13.150> going<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.570> replace<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.170> research

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
definitely going to replace the research

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.560 
definitely going to replace the research
door<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.190> one<00:04:15.489> we'll<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.419> little

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
door on this one we'll do a little

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.750 
door on this one we'll do a little
further<00:04:16.810> analysis<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.890> see<00:04:18.100> what<00:04:18.340> else<00:04:18.519> may

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
further analysis and see what else may

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.760 
further analysis and see what else may
need<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.060> be

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.010

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
okay now we can take a look at this door

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.140 
okay now we can take a look at this door
and<00:05:04.910> see<00:05:05.240> what<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.770> movement<00:05:07.010> looks<00:05:07.580> like<00:05:07.850> if

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
and see what the movement looks like if

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.450 
and see what the movement looks like if
you<00:05:08.570> look<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.050> back<00:05:09.260> side<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.620> this<00:05:09.920> axle

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
you look on the back side of this axle

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.250 
you look on the back side of this axle
from<00:05:10.880> where<00:05:11.210> we're<00:05:11.360> looking<00:05:11.480> at<00:05:11.810> you'll<00:05:12.020> see<00:05:12.230> a

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
from where we're looking at you'll see a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.040

are the metal wire is attached to the
the<00:05:47.630> Dodge<00:05:47.810> has<00:05:48.110> kind<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.410> a<00:05:48.530> strange<00:05:49.010> blend<00:05:49.610> or

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
the Dodge has kind of a strange blend or

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.810 
the Dodge has kind of a strange blend or
function<00:05:50.480> because<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:50.900> has<00:05:51.050> two<00:05:51.350> doors<00:05:51.820> with

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
function because it has two doors with

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.590 
function because it has two doors with
the<00:05:53.300> heater<00:05:53.780> core<00:05:54.520> laying<00:05:55.520> on<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> horizontal

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
the heater core laying on a horizontal

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.910 
the heater core laying on a horizontal
plane<00:05:56.930> in<00:05:57.170> the<00:05:57.260> center<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:59.620> it<00:06:00.620> actually

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
plane in the center and it actually

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.730 
plane in the center and it actually
works<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.580> where<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.570> bottom<00:06:02.990> door<00:06:03.200> will<00:06:03.500> come

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
works to where the bottom door will come

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.300 
works to where the bottom door will come
up<00:06:03.950> and<00:06:04.160> cover<00:06:04.460> the<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.720> heater<00:06:06.710> core<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.250> the

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
up and cover the the heater core and the

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.280 
up and cover the the heater core and the
top<00:06:07.520> door<00:06:07.790> will<00:06:08.060> come<00:06:08.360> down<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:08.930> cover<00:06:09.140> the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
top door will come down and cover the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.720 
top door will come down and cover the
heater<00:06:09.500> core<00:06:09.830> and<00:06:10.070> they're<00:06:10.190> they're

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
heater core and they're they're

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.170 
heater core and they're they're
connected<00:06:11.270> together<00:06:11.420> so<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:13.460> bottom<00:06:13.820> one<00:06:14.000> is

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
connected together so the bottom one is

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.180 
connected together so the bottom one is
really<00:06:14.450> just<00:06:14.660> a<00:06:14.810> follower<00:06:15.230> on<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.620> top<00:06:15.890> one

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
really just a follower on the top one

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.610 
really just a follower on the top one
and<00:06:16.430> if<00:06:17.000> the<00:06:17.090> top<00:06:17.300> one<00:06:17.510> is<00:06:17.660> in<00:06:17.810> good<00:06:17.990> shape<00:06:18.050> it

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
and if the top one is in good shape it

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.380 
and if the top one is in good shape it
would<00:06:18.860> be<00:06:18.980> very<00:06:19.160> rare<00:06:19.490> for<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.820> bottom<00:06:20.150> one<00:06:20.180> to

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
would be very rare for the bottom one to

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.240 
would be very rare for the bottom one to
be<00:06:20.510> broken<00:06:20.810> but<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.560> want<00:06:21.770> to<00:06:21.830> take<00:06:21.950> a<00:06:21.980> look<00:06:22.160> at

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
be broken but I want to take a look at

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.670 
be broken but I want to take a look at
that<00:06:22.370> anyway<00:06:22.580> so<00:06:22.780> when<00:06:23.780> I<00:06:23.810> pull<00:06:24.110> that<00:06:24.290> up<00:06:24.350> and

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
that anyway so when I pull that up and

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.100 
that anyway so when I pull that up and
down<00:06:24.890> I<00:06:25.630> can<00:06:26.630> feel<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.840> good<00:06:27.230> solid<00:06:27.590> movement<00:06:29.110> so

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
down I can feel a good solid movement so

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.290 
down I can feel a good solid movement so
the<00:06:30.530> blende<00:06:30.800> doors<00:06:31.070> are<00:06:31.400> okay<00:06:31.880> on<00:06:32.150> this

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
the blende doors are okay on this

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.510 
the blende doors are okay on this
particular<00:06:32.870> model<00:06:33.110> I'm<00:06:33.980> going<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.220> put<00:06:34.370> that

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
particular model I'm going to put that

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.980 
particular model I'm going to put that
back<00:06:34.580> together<00:06:35.000> and<00:06:35.390> we'll<00:06:35.510> put<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.810> motor

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
back together and we'll put the motor

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.939 
back together and we'll put the motor
back<00:06:36.110> on

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.249 

next<00:06:40.699> thing<00:06:40.819> we're<00:06:40.969> going<00:06:41.120> to<00:06:41.270> look<00:06:41.419> at<00:06:41.689> is<00:06:41.960> the

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
next thing we're going to look at is the

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.170 
next thing we're going to look at is the
mode<00:06:42.620> one<00:06:42.979> door<00:06:43.280> and<00:06:43.550> the<00:06:43.639> angle<00:06:43.969> you're

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
mode one door and the angle you're

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.200 
mode one door and the angle you're
seeing<00:06:44.810> this<00:06:44.960> from<00:06:45.199> is<00:06:45.680> from<00:06:46.460> the<00:06:46.550> floorboards

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
seeing this from is from the floorboards

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.230 
seeing this from is from the floorboards
on<00:06:47.389> the<00:06:47.479> passenger<00:06:48.050> side<00:06:48.430> and<00:06:49.430> again<00:06:49.759> that

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
on the passenger side and again that

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.709 
on the passenger side and again that
motor<00:06:50.509> has<00:06:50.900> two<00:06:51.800> screws<00:06:52.069> in<00:06:52.460> it<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.849> we'll

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
motor has two screws in it and we'll

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.260 
motor has two screws in it and we'll
remove<00:06:53.870> those<00:06:54.229> two<00:06:54.500> screws<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:55.370> pull<00:06:56.240> the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
remove those two screws and pull the

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.649 
remove those two screws and pull the
motor<00:06:56.569> off<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:57.199> now<00:06:57.319> we<00:06:57.379> can<00:06:57.800> see<00:06:58.189> a<00:06:58.659> white

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
motor off and now we can see a white

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.469 
motor off and now we can see a white
axle<00:07:00.139> that<00:07:00.289> extends<00:07:00.740> into<00:07:01.009> the<00:07:01.159> box<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.759> again

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
axle that extends into the box and again

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.899 
axle that extends into the box and again
this<00:07:02.870> should<00:07:03.169> have<00:07:03.469> a<00:07:03.500> limit<00:07:04.099> pan<00:07:04.370> on<00:07:04.580> the<00:07:04.699> back

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
this should have a limit pan on the back

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.809 
this should have a limit pan on the back
of<00:07:05.180> it<00:07:05.360> moving<00:07:06.050> between<00:07:06.409> two<00:07:06.770> molded<00:07:07.310> points

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 
of it moving between two molded points

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.290 
of it moving between two molded points
and<00:07:08.030> on<00:07:08.810> this<00:07:09.020> one<00:07:09.259> the<00:07:09.319> limit<00:07:10.189> pin<00:07:10.550> is<00:07:10.729> missing

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
and on this one the limit pin is missing

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.920 
and on this one the limit pin is missing
and<00:07:11.569> I<00:07:12.560> can<00:07:12.800> spin<00:07:13.159> that<00:07:13.430> axle<00:07:14.860> 360<00:07:15.860> degrees<00:07:16.930> so

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
and I can spin that axle 360 degrees so

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.820 
and I can spin that axle 360 degrees so
this<00:07:18.409> door<00:07:18.650> is<00:07:18.740> broken<00:07:19.099> so<00:07:19.550> the<00:07:19.669> mode<00:07:19.819> 1<00:07:20.060> door

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
this door is broken so the mode 1 door

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.890 
this door is broken so the mode 1 door
we<00:07:21.830> now<00:07:22.009> know<00:07:22.279> definitively<00:07:22.669> has<00:07:23.539> to<00:07:23.779> be

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
we now know definitively has to be

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.439 
we now know definitively has to be
replaced<00:07:24.379> and<00:07:25.159> we'll<00:07:25.639> put<00:07:25.819> that<00:07:25.969> on<00:07:26.029> the<00:07:26.150> list

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:26.449 
replaced and we'll put that on the list

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.740 
replaced and we'll put that on the list
so<00:07:26.779> so<00:07:27.110> far<00:07:27.349> we've<00:07:27.650> determined<00:07:28.039> a<00:07:28.460> bad<00:07:29.240> recert

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
so so far we've determined a bad recert

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.320 
so so far we've determined a bad recert
door<00:07:30.610> determine<00:07:31.610> that<00:07:31.729> the<00:07:31.849> blende<00:07:32.090> doors

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
door determine that the blende doors

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.339 
door determine that the blende doors
look<00:07:32.599> ok

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:33.349 
look ok

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:38.949 
look ok
and<00:07:33.669> found<00:07:34.669> that<00:07:34.879> the<00:07:35.270> mode<00:07:35.930> 1<00:07:36.169> door<00:07:36.439> is<00:07:36.680> bad
