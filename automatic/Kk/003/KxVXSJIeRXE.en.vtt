it's just gonna blow our minds so why

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's just gonna blow our minds so why
can't<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> quick<00:01:51.570> query<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> map<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
can't it do a quick query when a map is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
can't it do a quick query when a map is
loading<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.119> through<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.540> say<00:01:54.780> alright

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
loading to go through and say alright

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.399 
loading to go through and say alright
I'm<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.040> Yemen<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
I'm in Yemen right now what is the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
I'm in Yemen right now what is the
weather<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.070> Yemen<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.700> what<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
weather like in Yemen and what is the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
weather like in Yemen and what is the
current<00:02:00.840> time<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.409> day<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.920> Yemen<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.729> think

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
current time of day in Yemen and I think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
current time of day in Yemen and I think
that<00:02:03.149> would<00:02:03.240> make<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> gameplay<00:02:04.140> experience

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that would make the gameplay experience

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.700 
that would make the gameplay experience
that<00:02:05.460> much<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:06.270> enjoyable<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.409> people

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that much more enjoyable for people

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
that much more enjoyable for people
because<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
because they would know that say you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.090 
because they would know that say you
know

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
know

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.160 
know
in<00:02:11.190> England<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:12.000> England<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> six<00:02:12.840> hours

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
in England we know England is six hours

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.350 
in England we know England is six hours
ahead<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.560> us<00:02:13.800> right<00:02:14.070> say<00:02:14.580> there's<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> map<00:02:15.150> in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
ahead of us right say there's a map in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.290 
ahead of us right say there's a map in
London<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.740> we're<00:02:17.160> playing<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.850> nine<00:02:18.150> o'clock

London if we're playing at nine o'clock
at<00:02:18.690> night<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.320> would<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.680> know<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
at night we would now know then that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.830 
at night we would now know then that
London<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.420> 0<00:02:21.690> 3<00:02:22.680> a.m.<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.820> point<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.330> as

you go on through the night the map

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.010 
you go on through the night the map
would<00:02:26.730> change<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.390> comes<00:02:27.600> up<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.870> your

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020

rotation the map would look different

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970

your<00:02:30.330> lines<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.780> sight<00:02:31.050> might<00:02:31.350> look<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.740> little

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
your lines of sight might look a little

just pull a simple query saying what is

the weather like right now what time of
day<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.880> change<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.720> those<00:02:57.870> lighting

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
day is it and change all those lighting

day is it and change all those lighting
effects<00:02:58.560> based<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.370> with<00:03:00.060> having

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
effects based on that with having

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.060 
effects based on that with having
dedicated<00:03:00.660> servers<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.530> could<00:03:01.710> see<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.010> being

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
dedicated servers I could see this being

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.520 
dedicated servers I could see this being
a<00:03:02.490> lot<00:03:02.850> easier<00:03:03.240> for<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.750> game<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.230> able<00:03:04.320> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
a lot easier for the game to be able to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.070 
a lot easier for the game to be able to
pull<00:03:04.770> off<00:03:04.980> as<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.480> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.630> stuff<00:03:06.900> would

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
pull off as that kind of stuff would

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.650 
pull off as that kind of stuff would
then<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.440> set<00:03:07.710> from<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> server<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
then be set from the server to the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.620 
then be set from the server to the
clients<00:03:10.440> while<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> am<00:03:11.670> sure<00:03:11.940> there<00:03:12.180> are<00:03:12.330> so

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
clients while I am sure there are so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.270 
clients while I am sure there are so
many<00:03:12.750> other<00:03:12.870> things<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.680> could<00:03:13.860> think<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
many other things that I could think of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.820 
many other things that I could think of
to<00:03:14.340> improve<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.240> game<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:16.140> me<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.530> one

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
to improve this game for me this is one

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.140 
to improve this game for me this is one
that<00:03:16.980> would<00:03:17.100> keep<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.430> fresh<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> would

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that would keep it fresh and it would

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.700 
that would keep it fresh and it would
help<00:03:18.300> keep<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.720> fresh<00:03:18.960> throughout<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.500> year

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
help keep it fresh throughout the year

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.250 
help keep it fresh throughout the year
because<00:03:20.060> essentially<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.360> really<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.960> the
