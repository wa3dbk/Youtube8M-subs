 We are going to see the tutorial for people. 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.030
 stirred a bit with oil enhancement one 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.849
 tip is very interesting that is a tip 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 photoshop niche dot com our 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.010
 blog and five photoshop tips is for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 You see her before and after 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.330
 we have no model in black and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.910
 white we used some some methods 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.609
 only two tools 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.289
 that the blush and the enamel your ashes to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 board with nothing we'll get 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 arrive at this nice effect 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.280
 so come on let's go 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.860
 so oh we're here with a model 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.930
 here is the way it is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.520
 available in the links below and the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 watch and also to those in our 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 blog to italy just underneath 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.239
 the description of our thigh is so let's 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 start here our 2 click model 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.160
 here to stop was already bedridden 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 free bed or create a layer 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 above it and I will start with the process 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 here to do ours is improvement that a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 little in the eyes here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.600
 do not need a tablet, there's nothing we're going 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 basically use blush and tuc enamel 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.860
 so I took the bruno schick first with 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 the white color resulting from the new 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 leaving the color white and I'm going to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 one point here is white with 1 on top of it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.020
 my eye that Congress is 100% soft 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.210
 flow also the capacity of 860 after 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 done that I got the scudetto is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.729
 size there in the 50 pixels there depending 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.340
 will vary according to your image 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:39.680
 the resistance is at 30% I'll get one 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.680
 Little drag the bills to that dot 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 can fix that damage op 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.690
 already have a very nice effect but this 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.980
 is not what we are the point that the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.930
 People want to come, let's work one. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.710
 some serve and also merge 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.750
 Colors 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 so I'll do it and I'll get the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 I'm going to switch to werley or 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 drumstick and you can see it already 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.360
 improved mainly in the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.980
 issue of Eye lighting there is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.990
 Do you think you deserve it but it's just you? 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.100
 clicking just gave one against you is 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.350
 duplicate and this is what we are 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 over your eyes and you can 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.570
 also control the issue of capacity 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.190
 here it happens that the effect gets very strong 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 beauty then the first part of the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.390
 quality is ready second to second 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.020
 part creates a layer above and 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 change is here to move up positions 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.010
 linear exposure or find it 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.930
 beautiful 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 I do not know what the name is in English but the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.050
 even produced here does not even change 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.470
 only mine but this is the one that gives the third 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.480
 third box that the division of the goods 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.260
 Down the penultimate at their disposal 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.170
 inea 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.709
 so I'm going to click on it here 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.190
 I'll get a brunch again I'll pay 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:04.110
 they will pick up here now a gray or gray 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.690
 50% left s10 at zero and one here at 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 b leaving 50 percent home just for you 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.550
 thing is in this type here is very easy 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.500
 is already modifying the law 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.270
 You click here in the corner. 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.940
 hsb beauty 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.910
 done that there we go now is put 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.770
 a little there of brightness and some points in the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.420
 case here to improve the quality of 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.830
 when the eyes here is always legal to 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.200
 people trying for evidence will pick up 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.880
 opacity to move to 30% 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.840
 the flow in the house of fifty-something 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.610
 percent will spend here in this area in 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 back of the eyes 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.650
 ok not much did not have to spend much 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.050
 not only more or less will create another 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.989
 layer and will now merge before in 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.000
 super linear exposure 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.030
 it does the opposite of this same house that 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.820
 we made anti with the same brush 50% 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.650

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.850
 her that she will darken the points will 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.440
 highlight where you think 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.660
 that deserves attention if you want to spend some 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.530
 good eyes also can not have 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.660
 importance 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.790
 and to finish we'll do some 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.640
 co'll get here in the case of a blue 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.290

 eyes the beauty there will be like one 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.430
 little strange matte does not like to 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.979
 may leave indirect light and the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.320
 if you think it's here you give a 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.690
 against j to duplicate the layer 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.330
 is ours is basically done 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.040

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.310

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.070

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
 its image is an effect that can be 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.400
 used in its manipulations in the 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.680
 also paint to facilitate some 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.680
 effects and especially of lights there 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.320
