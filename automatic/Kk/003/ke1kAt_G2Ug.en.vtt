know<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.549> pre-trail<00:00:06.000> blogs<00:00:06.270> probably<00:00:06.660> aren't

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
very interesting so I thought I would

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.570 
very interesting so I thought I would
take<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.429> video<00:00:08.610> instead<00:00:09.920> I'm<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> practice

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
right now and I was all by myself last

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
right now and I was all by myself last
night<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.629> pretty<00:00:40.050> nervous<00:00:40.230> as

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
night and I was I was pretty nervous as

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.740 
night and I was I was pretty nervous as
it<00:00:40.649> was<00:00:40.770> getting<00:00:40.980> dark<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.420> turned<00:00:42.600> out

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it was getting dark but it it turned out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
it was getting dark but it it turned out
pretty<00:00:42.840> well<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.320> wasn't<00:00:43.710> nearly<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.010> scared<00:00:44.789> as

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
pretty well I wasn't nearly as scared as

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
pretty well I wasn't nearly as scared as
I<00:00:45.000> thought<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I thought it was going to be it was a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
I thought it was going to be it was a
pretty<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.579> wasn't<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> full<00:00:48.059> moon<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.510> think

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
pretty it wasn't a full moon but I think

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
pretty it wasn't a full moon but I think
the<00:00:48.809> full<00:00:48.930> moon<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.320> maybe<00:00:49.559> two<00:00:49.739> nights<00:00:49.950> ago

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the full moon was maybe two nights ago

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
the full moon was maybe two nights ago
so<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.000> moon<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.809> pretty

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so the moon was out and it was pretty

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
so the moon was out and it was pretty
light<00:00:52.350> maybe<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> has<00:00:52.980> something<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> do

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
light maybe that has something to do

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
light maybe that has something to do
with<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> went<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.890> um<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.570> did

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with it but but that went well um I did

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.389 
with it but but that went well um I did
I<00:00:57.600> had<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.079> condensation<00:00:58.410> issues<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.250> my

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I had some condensation issues with my

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.090 
I had some condensation issues with my
tent<00:00:59.670> which<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.600> expected<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.890> some

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tent which I expected to have some

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
tent which I expected to have some
condensation<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.210> froze<00:01:03.809> overnight<00:01:04.260> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
condensation but it froze overnight I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
condensation but it froze overnight I
wasn't<00:01:04.890> expecting<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.430> um<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.810> about

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
wasn't expecting that um it's about

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
wasn't expecting that um it's about
probably<00:01:07.470> about<00:01:07.530> thirty<00:01:07.890> five<00:01:08.100> degrees<00:01:08.670> right

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
probably about thirty five degrees right

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
probably about thirty five degrees right
now<00:01:08.939> I'd<00:01:09.479> say<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
now I'd say it probably got down to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
now I'd say it probably got down to
thirty<00:01:11.189> last<00:01:11.670> night<00:01:11.970> scenes<00:01:12.420> how<00:01:12.570> everything

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that big of a deal though I also learned

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.309 
that big of a deal though I also learned
to<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:11.009> take<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.430> many<00:02:11.520> pictures

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
to not take so many pictures

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.319 
to not take so many pictures
I<00:02:13.409> was<00:02:13.859> taking<00:02:14.219> a<00:02:14.280> picture<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.609> my<00:02:14.760> camp<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.209> I

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
I was taking a picture of my camp and I

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.599 
I was taking a picture of my camp and I
backed<00:02:15.569> into<00:02:15.840> some<00:02:16.799> briars<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.430> my

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
backed into some briars with my

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.410 
backed into some briars with my
Patagonia<00:02:18.480> micro<00:02:18.840> puff<00:02:19.079> jacket<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:21.269> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
Patagonia micro puff jacket on and I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.449 
Patagonia micro puff jacket on and I
ripped<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.749> couple<00:02:21.989> holes<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.409> back<00:02:22.590> so

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
ripped a couple holes in the back so

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.000 
ripped a couple holes in the back so
that<00:02:23.639> serves<00:02:23.849> me<00:02:24.030> right<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.239> guess<00:02:24.859> which<00:02:25.859> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that serves me right I guess which I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.289 
that serves me right I guess which I
can't<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.489> too<00:02:26.579> upset<00:02:26.639> about<00:02:26.969> that<00:02:27.180> because

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
can't be too upset about that because

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.550 
can't be too upset about that because
I'm<00:02:27.510> wear<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.719> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> woods<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.349> that's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I'm wear it in the woods so that's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.339 
I'm wear it in the woods so that's
that's<00:02:29.549> what<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> should<00:02:30.000> expect<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.480> suppose<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
that's what I should expect I suppose I

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.979 
that's what I should expect I suppose I
also<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.459> hung<00:02:32.760> my<00:02:32.790> bear<00:02:33.060> bag<00:02:33.269> last<00:02:33.540> night<00:02:33.750> I

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.209 
yesterday and then I hung it again last
night<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.889> really<00:02:38.340> wasn't<00:02:38.639> necessary<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.599> I

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
night it really wasn't necessary but I I

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.610
