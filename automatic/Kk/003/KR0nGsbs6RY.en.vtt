00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 and then personal - another video ip roto 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.859
 Commented here who speaks is the crime 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.439
 the subject of the time are tips for this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.699
 hype ers to improve your aim and also 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 your gameplay 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.880
 so the first thing is the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.109
 positioning 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.090
 You see there that the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.059
 positioning slightly different from the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.520
 other classes let's say both in the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 season it is 60 to 80 meters from the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 objective being that it can prevent or 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.870
 objective or prevented from 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 staff get there whole then there are two 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 important things that the sniper has to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 keep in mind you can hit your 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.899
 enemy in three ways for three 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.899
 different situations 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 the first is the future point that is you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.630
 let out a little apart already know 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 where your enemy goes and you already 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 have prepared is what you are seeing 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.790
 there nobody play so the future point 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 be effective you can not leave your 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.009
 first stop 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 or you make a rock shox you 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.000
 slide 1 per family to your enemy 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.280
 it's not because you're not going to hit it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 completely where he is but a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.820
 possible location or you accompany the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 your aim until you get your mere 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.700
 stay red 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.549
 remembering that the sniper works with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 accuracy if you are not sure what will 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.299
 to hit the target, you'd better wait for a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 little and when you're sure 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.140
 you shoot 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.060
 it's much better you get damage and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.820
 then you get a tour of what 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.439
 you mess up or fool around 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.060
 shots without hitting anyone 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.860
 the second module is for those at the time 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 more offensive we'll be there in the area 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.079
 objective and will not properly do 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.939
 the goal but it is at a distance 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.000
 shorter than your enemy 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.049
 So you have to have precision and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 speed 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.800
 are the two things you need to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.380
 get to master this technique 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 You'll just leave your 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 enemy a little weaker with 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 secondary and then switch to your 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.910
 primary because it is secondary 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.910
 the secondary one has a minor damage of 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.760
 that more obviously then your 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.250
 enemy he will not run at first 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.410
 so you have time to change your weapon 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.300
 and I got it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.360
 already the third module is the jack short 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.060
 also used by a more offensive sniper 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.490
 You'll only be able to do this like mr. 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 up close because from afar you will not 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.590
 be very sure where the shot goes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.020
 pick up or a scout scout is ideal for 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.900
 You do it because when you jump 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.970
 and a half with scout his aim will close 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
 the two good times for you to hit 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.240
 Your sniper shot is when the enemy 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.430
 has cover 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.600
 he's going to get off the bend to try to hit 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.820
 a shot the macchio turkey you go there already 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.400
 anticipated in his move you hit 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.500
 a shot nobody will your friend catch here 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.260
 Do you take a tour or do you 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 when there are animations falling animations 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.600
 or when he jumps he can not do 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.270
 no other is so it gets much more 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.220
 easy for you to hit so personal but it's 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.290
 even if you liked your ex 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.250
 favorite to help in the dissemination if 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.410
 did not you like it 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.050
 leave your design and also commit because 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.040
 This will help in future videos. 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.040
 So I said go
