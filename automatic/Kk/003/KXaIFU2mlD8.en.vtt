00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
think that's what it's called so let's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
think that's what it's called so let's
put<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:54.229> take<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799

put that in there take that out now the
cool<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.790> case<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
cool thing about this case is that it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.380 
cool thing about this case is that it
has<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> film<00:01:58.110> over<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.729> course<00:01:59.909> it's

kind of like a screen protector so the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
kind of like a screen protector so the
capacitive<00:02:02.790> screen<00:02:03.000> will<00:02:03.180> still<00:02:03.420> work<00:02:03.509> behind
