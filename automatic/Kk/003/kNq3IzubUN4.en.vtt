00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 welcome to cooking with wendy guys 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.740
 I have some stuffed potatoes 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 delicious and super easy to make 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.160
 let's start making our fill 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.559
 we need to put a medium fire 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.220
 fry a jet of oil and let's 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.410
 fry our onion frying half 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
 medium chopped onion in squares 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 and I'm adding half a spoonful 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.519
 of chopped or ground garlic we are going to mix 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 these two very well and now we are going to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.109
 add a spoonful of ají panca 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.719
 ground if they do not get ají panca in the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.829
 country where they can add paprika 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.710
 ground or ground paprika that we're going to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 add pepper salt and oregano now 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.220
 taste 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.380
 mix all this very well and hope that 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.110
 the transparent onion completely 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.760
 is well fried let's add now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.399
 250 grams of ground beef 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.239
 let's wait for it to cool very well and 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.420
 that there is no liquid left of the meat 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.970
 Once it's all right, take it out 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.939
 Now we need four cooked potatoes 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.039
 of large size or nine medium sized 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.640
 things very well in this case I am using 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.110
 american rus potatoes stand out usa 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.590
 let's add a little salt to the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.720
 taste and it depends on the consistency of the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 potatoes they are using are used rue 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.700
 you need a little milk if they are another 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.619
 type of potatoes may not need it 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 the thing that has to be formed first 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.720
 as well as masita is look 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.880
 as well as that because 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.980
 some potatoes do not need milk 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.730
 remember do not add milk that you do not 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.620
 they need 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.810
 let's beat a little egg and reserve it 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.800
 We need to remember the boiled egg 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.540

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.590
