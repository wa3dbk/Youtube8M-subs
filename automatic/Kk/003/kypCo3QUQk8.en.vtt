we are going to be doing a procedure

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.929 
we are going to be doing a procedure
called<00:00:16.410> oiling<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:18.109> what<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> oiling<00:00:19.619> out

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
called oiling out what is oiling out

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.659 
called oiling out what is oiling out
boiling<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.449> when<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.349> apply<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.070> thin

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
boiling out is when you apply a thin

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.589 
boiling out is when you apply a thin
layer<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:23.910> oil<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.499> medium<00:00:26.089> to<00:00:27.089> a<00:00:27.119> painting

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
layer of oil or of medium to a painting

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.110 
layer of oil or of medium to a painting
and<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.279> do<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.820> order<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.320> number<00:00:31.320> one

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
and you do that in order to number one

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.819 
and you do that in order to number one
even<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.660> surface<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.350> painting

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
even out the surface of that painting

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.459 
even out the surface of that painting
and<00:00:35.090> number<00:00:36.090> two<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:37.320> saturate<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.070> colors

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
and number two to saturate the colors

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
and number two to saturate the colors
saturating<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> colors<00:00:40.980> should<00:00:41.789> be

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
saturating the colors should be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270 
saturating the colors should be
self-explanatory<00:00:42.710> because<00:00:43.710> after<00:00:44.070> all

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
self-explanatory because after all

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.099 
self-explanatory because after all
that's<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> things<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.989> people

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
that's one of the things that people

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's one of the things that people
love<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.649> an<00:00:47.129> oil<00:00:47.340> painting<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.269> fact

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
love about an oil painting and in fact

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
love about an oil painting and in fact
one<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.769> main<00:00:50.010> reasons<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:50.820> artist

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
one of the main reasons that an artist

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840 
one of the main reasons that an artist
will<00:00:51.329> varnish<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.929> painting<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:53.250> saturate

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
will varnish is painting is to saturate

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.319 
will varnish is painting is to saturate
the<00:00:53.969> colors<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> say<00:00:55.620> even<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the colors but when I say even out the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
the colors but when I say even out the
surface<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.170> painting<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.339> do<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.550> mean

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
surface of the painting what do I mean

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.709 
surface of the painting what do I mean
by<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.149> well<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.320> common<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.789> painting

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
by that well it's common for a painting

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.749 
by that well it's common for a painting
to<00:01:04.019> dry<00:01:05.210> with<00:01:06.210> an<00:01:06.390> uneven<00:01:06.840> surface<00:01:07.310> quality<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
to dry with an uneven surface quality in

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.580 
to dry with an uneven surface quality in
other<00:01:08.939> words<00:01:09.210> parts<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> painting<00:01:10.409> will

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
other words parts of the painting will

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.580 
other words parts of the painting will
be<00:01:10.619> sucking<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.579> matte<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.509> other<00:01:13.200> parts

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
be sucking in or matte and other parts

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 
be sucking in or matte and other parts
will<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.920> more<00:01:14.189> shiny<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:15.119> glossy<00:01:15.439> that's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
will be more shiny or glossy that's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
will be more shiny or glossy that's
especially<00:01:16.710> true<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.820> indirect<00:01:18.659> method

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
especially true with the indirect method

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.200 
especially true with the indirect method
of<00:01:19.140> painting<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.030> will

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
of painting that I use because I will

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
of painting that I use because I will
put<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.960> layer<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.380> paint<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> let<00:01:23.399> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
put one layer of paint down and let it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.020 
put one layer of paint down and let it
dry<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> couple<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.270> days

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.800 

[Music]

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
[Music]

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
[Music]
another<00:01:30.810> layer<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.700> layers

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
another layer and so all these layers

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390 
another layer and so all these layers
will<00:01:33.270> dry<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.140> different<00:01:34.620> times<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.310> that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
will dry at different times and that's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.570 
will dry at different times and that's
what<00:01:35.730> makes<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.480> sinking<00:01:37.410> in<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.340> paint

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
what makes the sinking in of the paint

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.540 
what makes the sinking in of the paint
film<00:01:38.850> occur<00:01:40.040> okay<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
film occur okay I got it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.960 
film occur okay I got it
so<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.630> fix<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> sinking<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> saturate

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so to fix the sinking in and to saturate

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.260 
so to fix the sinking in and to saturate
colors<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.960> boiling<00:01:46.830> out<00:01:46.980> right<00:01:47.400> well<00:01:47.970> that's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
colors use boiling out right well that's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.010 
colors use boiling out right well that's
right

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
right

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.530 
right
but<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:50.010> alternative<00:01:50.580> method<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
but there is an alternative method that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.970 
but there is an alternative method that
would<00:01:51.660> accomplish<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.260> same<00:01:52.500> thing<00:01:54.980> you

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
would accomplish the same thing you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.210 
would accomplish the same thing you
could<00:01:56.160> use<00:01:56.400> retouch<00:01:56.880> varnish<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:59.010> not

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
could use retouch varnish but that's not

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.280 
could use retouch varnish but that's not
really<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> good<00:01:59.670> idea<00:02:00.030> because<00:02:00.300> retouch

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
really a good idea because retouch

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.400 
really a good idea because retouch
varnish<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.979> soluble<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.140> want

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
varnish is soluble and you don't want

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.590 
varnish is soluble and you don't want
something<00:02:04.710> soluble<00:02:05.610> within<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> layers<00:02:06.420> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
something soluble within the layers of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
something soluble within the layers of
your<00:02:06.720> painting<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.880> than

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
your painting that would more than

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570 
your painting that would more than
likely<00:02:09.229> interfere<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> bonding<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
likely interfere with the bonding of the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.330 
likely interfere with the bonding of the
other<00:02:11.760> paint<00:02:12.060> layers<00:02:12.300> okay<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
other paint layers okay got that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.640 
other paint layers okay got that
don't<00:02:14.850> use<00:02:15.150> retouch<00:02:15.540> varnish<00:02:15.960> yeah<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> don't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
don't use retouch varnish yeah I don't

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.440 
don't use retouch varnish yeah I don't
use<00:02:16.920> retouch<00:02:17.280> varnish<00:02:17.640> if<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
use retouch varnish if you are in the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
use retouch varnish if you are in the
middle<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> painting<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.580> use

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
middle of a painting but you can use

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
middle of a painting but you can use
retouch<00:02:21.060> varnish<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.110> are<00:02:22.230> finished<00:02:22.620> but

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
retouch varnish if you are finished but

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
retouch varnish if you are finished but
I<00:02:23.250> still<00:02:23.670> prefer<00:02:23.940> oiling<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:25.700> okay<00:02:26.730> when

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I still prefer oiling out okay when

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.430 
I still prefer oiling out okay when
exactly<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.160> use<00:02:29.520> foiling<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.630> that's<00:02:31.260> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
exactly do I use foiling out that's a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.229 
exactly do I use foiling out that's a
good<00:02:31.680> question<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.520> lot<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.510> artists<00:02:34.050> choose<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
good question a lot of artists choose to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.540 
good question a lot of artists choose to
even<00:02:36.239> out<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> surface<00:02:37.070> before<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> painting

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
even out the surface before the painting

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.790 
even out the surface before the painting
is<00:02:38.670> finished<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:40.200> they<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.530> better

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
is finished so that they can better

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.400 
is finished so that they can better
judge<00:02:41.280> color<00:02:42.120> saturation<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:44.930> I'll<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
judge color saturation and I'll do that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.280 
judge color saturation and I'll do that
sometimes<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.640> almost<00:02:47.910> always<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
sometimes but I almost always do the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.340 
sometimes but I almost always do the
oiling<00:02:49.769> out<00:02:49.890> procedure<00:02:50.720> after<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> painting<00:02:52.110> is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350

finished either before applying the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
varnish and oiling out is that when

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.199 
varnish and oiling out is that when
you're<00:03:10.200> oiling<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.950> basically<00:03:11.760> what<00:03:11.970> you're

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
you're oiling out basically what you're

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.620 
you're oiling out basically what you're
doing<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.690> applying<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.440> clear<00:03:13.830> glaze<00:03:14.790> layer<00:03:15.269> on

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
doing is applying a clear glaze layer on

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.979 
doing is applying a clear glaze layer on
your<00:03:16.190> painting<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.970> permanent<00:03:18.239> layer<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
your painting it's a permanent layer and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.440 
your painting it's a permanent layer and
it<00:03:19.290> becomes<00:03:19.650> part<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> painting<00:03:20.610> varnish

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
it becomes part of the painting varnish

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.199 
it becomes part of the painting varnish
is<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:22.489> non-porous<00:03:23.989> protective<00:03:24.989> layer<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.590> is

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
is a non-porous protective layer that is

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.080 
is a non-porous protective layer that is
removable<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.570> saturates<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.320> colors<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
removable it saturates the colors and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
removable it saturates the colors and
also<00:03:30.090> provides<00:03:30.630> protection<00:03:31.410> against<00:03:31.920> dust

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
also provides protection against dust

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.879 
also provides protection against dust
and<00:03:32.430> dirt<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.970> with<00:03:33.750> varnish<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.530> remove

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
and dirt and with varnish you can remove

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.920

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
it clean the painting and reapply it so

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.449 
it clean the painting and reapply it so
should<00:03:39.079> i<00:03:39.170> Barna<00:03:39.560> sh<00:03:39.590> my<00:03:39.739> painting<00:03:40.159> when<00:03:40.310> it's

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
should i Barna sh my painting when it's

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
should i Barna sh my painting when it's
finished<00:03:40.819> well<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.510> would<00:03:41.930> say<00:03:42.140> that's<00:03:42.379> a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
finished well I would say that's a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.229 
finished well I would say that's a
personal<00:03:43.129> choice<00:03:43.510> because<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.879> varnish<00:03:46.879> has

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
personal choice because the varnish has

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.309 
personal choice because the varnish has
an<00:03:48.170> aesthetic<00:03:48.890> purpose<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:50.540> also<00:03:50.719> serves

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
an aesthetic purpose and it also serves

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.399 
an aesthetic purpose and it also serves
as<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.879> protective<00:03:52.879> layer<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.780> don't<00:03:54.109> feel

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
as a protective layer but I don't feel

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.849 
as a protective layer but I don't feel
that<00:03:54.469> the<00:03:55.329> protective<00:03:56.329> aspect<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.560> as

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
that the protective aspect is as

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.429 
that the protective aspect is as
important<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:58.730> was<00:03:59.090> say<00:03:59.840> hundred<00:04:00.230> years

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
important as it was say hundred years

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.390 
important as it was say hundred years
ago<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.889> mean<00:04:01.370> we<00:04:01.639> don't<00:04:01.760> use<00:04:02.209> oil<00:04:02.450> lamps<00:04:03.049> and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
ago I mean we don't use oil lamps and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.610 
ago I mean we don't use oil lamps and
coal<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.760> heat<00:04:04.939> with<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.780> wood<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.409> heat

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
coal the heat with and wood the heat

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.860 
coal the heat with and wood the heat
with<00:04:06.859> like<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:07.939> used<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:09.920> there<00:04:10.700> isn't

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
with like we used to and so there isn't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.509 
with like we used to and so there isn't
that<00:04:11.870> problem<00:04:12.409> with<00:04:12.620> soot<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:13.340> used

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
that problem with soot that there used

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.610 
that problem with soot that there used
to<00:04:13.669> be<00:04:13.849> but<00:04:14.419> a<00:04:14.480> lot<00:04:14.629> of<00:04:14.930> people<00:04:15.290> feel<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
to be but a lot of people feel that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.499 
to be but a lot of people feel that
adding<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.250> final<00:04:16.519> protective<00:04:16.820> layer<00:04:17.299> is

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
adding a final protective layer is

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.320 
adding a final protective layer is
important<00:04:18.019> so<00:04:18.320> again<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.280> up<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:22.030> now<00:04:23.030> if

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
important so again it's up to you now if

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050 
important so again it's up to you now if
you<00:04:23.660> are<00:04:24.169> going<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.560> apply<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:25.070> final<00:04:25.580> coat<00:04:25.940> of

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
you are going to apply a final coat of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.900 
you are going to apply a final coat of
varnish<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.919> your<00:04:27.919> painting<00:04:28.220> has<00:04:28.610> that

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
varnish and your painting has that

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.150 
varnish and your painting has that
sinking<00:04:29.389> in<00:04:29.660> problem<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.740> we<00:04:30.830> talked<00:04:31.070> about

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
sinking in problem that we talked about

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.450 
sinking in problem that we talked about
earlier<00:04:31.699> it's<00:04:32.599> still<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> good<00:04:33.199> idea<00:04:33.259> to<00:04:33.710> oil

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
earlier it's still a good idea to oil

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.890 
earlier it's still a good idea to oil
out<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:35.720> fix<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.349> before<00:04:37.180> applying<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.509> final

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
out to fix that before applying a final

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.800 
out to fix that before applying a final
coat<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.110> varnish<00:04:43.210> there's<00:04:44.210> another<00:04:44.510> thing

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
coat of varnish there's another thing

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.960 
coat of varnish there's another thing
you<00:04:45.199> should<00:04:45.229> know<00:04:45.590> about<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.280> final<00:04:46.610> coat<00:04:46.820> of

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
you should know about the final coat of

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.870 
you should know about the final coat of
varnish<00:04:47.470> before<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.620> apply<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:49.010> final<00:04:49.550> coat<00:04:49.729> of

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
varnish before you apply a final coat of

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.060 
varnish before you apply a final coat of
varnish<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.389> an<00:04:50.510> oil<00:04:50.690> painting<00:04:51.229> that<00:04:51.830> old

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
varnish to an oil painting that old

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.250 
varnish to an oil painting that old
painting<00:04:52.490> needs<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.849> be<00:04:52.970> completely<00:04:53.599> dry<00:04:53.870> now

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
painting needs to be completely dry now
