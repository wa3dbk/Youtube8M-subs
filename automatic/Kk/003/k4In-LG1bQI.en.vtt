00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
for free in this one little area because

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
for free in this one little area because
they<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.400> care<00:01:08.729> enough<00:01:09.229> check<00:01:10.229> lift

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.010 
actually went sledding for the first
time<00:01:13.680> um<00:01:14.220> after<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> day<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.360> over<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.780> walked

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
time um after the day was over we walked

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
time um after the day was over we walked
out<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.320> front<00:01:16.350> door<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.950> onto<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> ski

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
out the front door right onto the ski

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310 
out the front door right onto the ski
run<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> blue<00:01:19.290> or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
run and it was like a it was a blue or

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.730 
run and it was like a it was a blue or
something<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> blue<00:01:20.460> /<00:01:20.790> green<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.740> got

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
something like that blue / green and got

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
something like that blue / green and got
on<00:01:22.860> sleds<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.640> went<00:01:23.820> head<00:01:24.030> first<00:01:24.060> down

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
on sleds and just went head first down

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
on sleds and just went head first down
it<00:01:25.500> feels<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.850> fast

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it feels like you're going so fast

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
it feels like you're going so fast
because<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.560> six<00:01:28.920> inches<00:01:29.250> off

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
because you're only like six inches off

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
because you're only like six inches off
the<00:01:29.430> ground<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.270> reality<00:01:30.750> we're

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the ground I mean in reality we're

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
the ground I mean in reality we're
probably<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> quarter<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
probably going around a quarter of the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
better than me at this point I remember

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.210 
better than me at this point I remember
the<00:02:43.280> days<00:02:43.489> when<00:02:44.350> he<00:02:45.350> was<00:02:45.470> keeping<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:46.070> me

house<00:02:50.239> up<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.660> um<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.519> into<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> park

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
house up there um but so into the park

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.670 
house up there um but so into the park
for<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.420> little<00:02:53.540> bit<00:02:53.690> unfortunately<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.590> way

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
for a little bit unfortunately the way

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.080 
for a little bit unfortunately the way
it<00:02:54.800> was<00:02:54.920> designed<00:02:55.130> there<00:02:55.550> were<00:02:55.640> these<00:02:55.760> four

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
it was designed there were these four

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.960 
it was designed there were these four
jumps<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.530> was<00:02:57.650> on<00:02:57.830> sort<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.459> pretty

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
jumps and it was on sort of a pretty

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.570 
jumps and it was on sort of a pretty
pretty<00:02:59.450> shallow<00:02:59.810> slope<00:03:00.350> much<00:03:01.070> more<00:03:01.280> shallow

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
pretty shallow slope much more shallow

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.780 
pretty shallow slope much more shallow
than<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:02.450> parks<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:03.050> usually<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
than then parks are usually on so the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.729 
than then parks are usually on so the
first<00:03:04.970> two<00:03:05.269> were<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.480> really<00:03:06.110> big<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.709> mean

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
first two were just really big I mean

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.009 
first two were just really big I mean
the<00:03:07.130> first<00:03:07.280> kicker<00:03:07.610> was<00:03:07.880> probably<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.480> good<00:03:08.690> 30

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
the first kicker was probably a good 30

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.160 
the first kicker was probably a good 30
foot<00:03:09.380> gap<00:03:09.620> with<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> 7-foot<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.910> pick<00:03:11.780> her<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.019> it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
foot gap with a 7-foot I pick her to it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.259 
foot gap with a 7-foot I pick her to it
and<00:03:12.320> that's<00:03:12.769> that's<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.430> bit<00:03:13.550> over<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> top<00:03:13.880> for

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
and that's that's a bit over the top for

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.880 
and that's that's a bit over the top for
me<00:03:14.330> I'm<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.840> amazing<00:03:15.110> I'm<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.650> way<00:03:15.860> better

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
me I'm not that amazing I'm a way better

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.920 
me I'm not that amazing I'm a way better
skateboarder<00:03:16.430> than<00:03:16.910> snowboarding<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.840> you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
skateboarder than snowboarding if you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.530 
skateboarder than snowboarding if you
can<00:03:18.079> compare<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.590> two<00:03:18.739> apples<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.370> oranges

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
can compare the two apples to oranges

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.900 
can compare the two apples to oranges
but<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.680> would<00:03:21.950> skip<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.310> first<00:03:22.489> two<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.790> go

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
but so I would skip the first two and go

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.550 
but so I would skip the first two and go
for<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> last<00:03:23.360> two<00:03:23.540> which<00:03:23.660> probably<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.200> 20

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
for the last two which probably like 20

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.250 
for the last two which probably like 20

foot jumps with pretty small kickers but

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.740
