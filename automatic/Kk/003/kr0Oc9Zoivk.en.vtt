00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.470
 when 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.680
 I was laughing 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.169
 from here 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.839
 Hello everyone during the attack 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.299
 there was a shorter topic here 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.939
 what you need to take on the logistics 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.939

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.289
 DJ disk written in a format 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.519
 the girl di 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.460
 I do not know for what reason no one 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.239
 can write audio gray hair coal 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.159
 DJs shorter when they swear 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.179
 bring small disks when im 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.340
 bring money to blues 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.510
 when I don't know there were several that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.270
 will wear 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.110
 in short let's consider how 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.400
 very simple way without any 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.250
 third-party programs recorded in audio 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.150
 is sitting 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.790
 for this we need god 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.120
 just 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.650
 this is a wonderful program which 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.790
 turn up the player 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.520
 Windows media 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 he's a media player here we open it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 see some garbage 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
 in principle there can be another track 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.670
 but honestly the tip of the tongue 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.460
 Katia seven days a week and those who score 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 ordered sanctions so we have opened 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.750
 play dream languages 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.390
 in their hands 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 no, let's say one reason just like that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.690
 it still does not rule with them conceded the question 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 Hindu enterprises such Windows 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.310
 in 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.950
 however, new national office data

 I will know for free 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.670
 music was very easy for me 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.010
 refuse 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.020
 push the overlay record 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.660
 fine 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.730
 this is the workspace

 that is, here you open your folder 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.500
 cons whether a lot just choose your 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 minuses 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 click on parking 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.729
 cool do not need to 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.389
 the second 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.459
 first takes its shortcomings 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.649
 fellow speakers 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.859

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.870

 all ideas m does not interrupt no less 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:46.879
 balay sits 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.769

 sits 5 I bought 6 editor for 10 rubles 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.129
 it's not a lot of money 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.129
 we invade dealers our computer 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.090
 creative path will call terrible 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.829
 sounds 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829
 and press a button to start recording 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.540
 on this spot 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510
 nevertheless we drive dive 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.189

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.139
 artist and half-dolls 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.369
 author 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.159
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.409
 confident most of our business 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.449
 by the way in an empty disk lats 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.329
 I left my disk 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.579
 by the way start again nightly zakosit game

 pay sell only broken disks 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.359
 for this you need to finish Michael 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.789
 baharev 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.259
 I admit that the consumer 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.239
 rush 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 but if packages 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.139
 asia we start recording no start otherwise 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.919
 Chief 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.609
 what was in the beginning is recording like this 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.069
 happens 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.199
 he just first checked the tracks by 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.709
 bestowal lazovic but also in the eyes 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.389
 eye phase appear such food it may 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.069
 take but i don't know mr if you 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.979
 write alt tab one to five minutes and then 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.549
 war slashed 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.889
 coffin five minutes no more 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.199
 so 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 97 percent 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.610
 as cool as 97 centimeters 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.419
 Tyumen Nekruto 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.789
 experts believe this has affected 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.699
 results so 99 percent of villages 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.099
 record bypass Novodvinsk with your 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.430
 Okhotina themselves are orphan thousand 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.110
 so important is the care of the ship 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.719
 several bottles but production 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:43.819
 people 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.229
 that's shorter 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.229
 brand beech just spit out the gloom 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.110
 we insert sideways will not be better than expected 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.800
 then her tape recorder in order to check 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.830
 because the radio tape recorder basically lives what 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.749
 the same rules that housing but DJ 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:01.550
 then too 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.449
 like that 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.849
 Louise 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 to investigators 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.439
 in short, there are such things 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.779
 right now 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.929
 who is interested in another alternative 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.839
 method of recording recoil see the following doses
