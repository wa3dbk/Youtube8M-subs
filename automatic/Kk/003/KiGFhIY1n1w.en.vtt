00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bookstore or even online some practice

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
bookstore or even online some practice
tests<00:00:41.430> where<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.510> comfortable<00:00:42.840> with

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the format then I also recommend

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.310 
the format then I also recommend
studying<00:00:46.550> root<00:00:47.550> words<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.289> prefixes<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
studying root words and prefixes and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
studying root words and prefixes and
suffixes<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.579> often<00:00:50.820> let<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.629> can

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
suffixes and these are often let you can

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
suffixes and these are often let you can
find<00:00:51.960> lists<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> Greek<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> Latin<00:00:53.270> prefixes

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and suffixes and roots and this will

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
and suffixes and roots and this will
help<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:57.000> start<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> recognize<00:00:57.750> word

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
help you to start to recognize word

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
help you to start to recognize word
words<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> connect<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.699> their

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
words and connect them with their

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
words and connect them with their
meanings<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.680> help<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the prefix or you recognize the root it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.950 
the prefix or you recognize the root it
might<00:01:10.049> help<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.630> eliminate<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
answer choices and make a better guess

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
answer choices and make a better guess
another<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.939> strategy<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.540> little

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
another good strategy is to make little

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
another good strategy is to make little
flash<00:01:19.049> cards<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.369> you're

you know pull them out when you have a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.560 
you know pull them out when you have a
few<00:01:29.759> minutes<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.329> drill<00:01:31.079> yourself<00:01:31.500> on
