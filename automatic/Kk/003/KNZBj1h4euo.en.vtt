sure that you give it everything you got
in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> gym<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:28.169> hundred<00:00:28.439> percent<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.800> your

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
in the gym one hundred percent of your

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.529 
in the gym one hundred percent of your
energy<00:00:29.069> hundreds<00:00:29.729> of<00:00:29.819> your<00:00:29.999> focus<00:00:30.390> and

energy hundreds of your focus and
intensity<00:00:31.319> i<00:00:31.679> was<00:00:31.919> thinking<00:00:32.220> about<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
intensity i was thinking about this and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.990 
intensity i was thinking about this and
intensity<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.859> one<00:00:35.129> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> factors<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.699> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
intensity is one of the factors that are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
intensity is one of the factors that are
so<00:00:36.629> important<00:00:37.199> but<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.859> people<00:00:38.070> don't

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
so important but a lot of people don't

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.319 
so important but a lot of people don't
really<00:00:38.309> concentrate<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.179> they

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really concentrate on it they

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
really concentrate on it they
concentrate<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.559> type<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.769> exercise<00:00:41.370> they

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
concentrate on the type of exercise they

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.889 
concentrate on the type of exercise they
should<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> doing<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.359> concentrate<00:00:42.840> on

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
should be doing they concentrate on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
should be doing they concentrate on
their<00:00:43.050> diet<00:00:43.379> concentrate<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.510> other

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
their diet concentrate on all the other

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
their diet concentrate on all the other
components<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.859> all<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.429> important

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
components which is all very important

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
components which is all very important
but<00:00:48.600> those<00:00:49.410> components<00:00:49.859> are<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.640> as

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
but those components are not as

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.750 
but those components are not as
important<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.749> you<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.499> have<00:00:52.769> intensity

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
important if you don't have intensity

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
important if you don't have intensity
master<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.260> i<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.559> thinking<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:55.980> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
master down so i was thinking about this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
master down so i was thinking about this
before<00:00:56.460> making<00:00:56.609> this<00:00:56.760> video<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.269> way<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
before making this video as a way to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.049 
before making this video as a way to
really<00:00:57.809> explain<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:59.010> intensity<00:00:59.579> actually

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
really explain what intensity actually

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
really explain what intensity actually
is<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.600> intensity<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:02.429> opinion<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
is so intensity in my opinion is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
is so intensity in my opinion is
basically<00:01:03.480> exerting<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.410> hundred<00:01:05.070> percent<00:01:05.190> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
basically exerting a hundred percent of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.660 
basically exerting a hundred percent of
the<00:01:06.240> amount<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.660> energy<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the amount of energy that you have so

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
the amount of energy that you have so
let's<00:01:09.210> say<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.740> feeling<00:01:11.100> great<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
let's say if you are feeling great and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
let's say if you are feeling great and
you're<00:01:12.360> feeling<00:01:12.720> jacked<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> you've<00:01:13.620> got

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you're feeling jacked up and you've got

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
you're feeling jacked up and you've got
like<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.520> energy<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.480> for

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
like this much energy right just for

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
like this much energy right just for
example<00:01:15.990> well<00:01:16.800> an<00:01:17.100> intense<00:01:17.490> workout<00:01:17.760> doesn't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
example well an intense workout doesn't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
example well an intense workout doesn't
mean<00:01:18.480> I<00:01:18.510> just<00:01:18.840> lifted<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.440> weight<00:01:19.650> no<00:01:19.860> no

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
mean I just lifted all this weight no no

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.040 
mean I just lifted all this weight no no
what<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> means<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.660> gave<00:01:21.870> it

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
what it means is that you gave it

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.050 
what it means is that you gave it
everything<00:01:22.530> you've<00:01:22.800> got<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.430> maxed<00:01:23.970> out

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
everything you've got and you maxed out

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.690 
everything you've got and you maxed out
you<00:01:24.240> used<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.230> the<00:01:25.920> available<00:01:26.220> energy

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you used up all of the available energy

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
you used up all of the available energy
that<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.480> have<00:01:27.750> during<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> workout<00:01:28.890> let's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that you have during the workout let's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
that you have during the workout let's
say<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.970> max<00:01:30.210> amount<00:01:30.360> energy<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
say the max amount energy that you have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.320 
say the max amount energy that you have
let's<00:01:32.130> say<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> only<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.030> right

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
let's say is only this much right

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.760 
let's say is only this much right
usually<00:01:33.690> it's<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.320> today<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> only

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
usually it's this much but today is only

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
usually it's this much but today is only
this<00:01:34.980> much<00:01:35.220> happens<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.940> all<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> us<00:01:36.480> guess

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this much happens to all of us guess

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
this much happens to all of us guess
what<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.440> still<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> very<00:01:38.580> high

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
what you can still have a very high

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660 
what you can still have a very high
intensity<00:01:39.420> workout<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.860> maximize<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
intensity workout if you maximize and
