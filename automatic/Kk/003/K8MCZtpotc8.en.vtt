so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> installed<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.920> Shimano<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.939> dynamo<00:00:03.360> hub

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so I installed a Shimano of dynamo hub

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.419 
so I installed a Shimano of dynamo hub
on<00:00:04.350> my<00:00:05.839> touring<00:00:06.839> bicycle<00:00:07.290> generates<00:00:08.220> power

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
on my touring bicycle generates power

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.820 
on my touring bicycle generates power
from<00:00:09.179> revolutions<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> front<00:00:10.410> wheel<00:00:10.559> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
from revolutions of the front wheel and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.330 
from revolutions of the front wheel and
I'm<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> give<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> demo<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.889> how<00:00:14.009> it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I'm going to give you a demo on how it

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.260 
I'm going to give you a demo on how it
works<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.230> explain<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.850> guess<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.150> all

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
works and explain I guess how it's all

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.390 
works and explain I guess how it's all
put<00:00:18.480> together<00:00:18.830> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.580> hub<00:00:20.869> itself

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
put together this is the hub itself

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.060 
put together this is the hub itself
nothing<00:00:23.400> too<00:00:23.699> special<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.359> it's

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
nothing too special about it it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.310 
nothing too special about it it's
magnetic<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.210> corner<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.939> see

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
magnetic here in a corner you will see

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.549 
magnetic here in a corner you will see
where<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> wires<00:00:31.830> come<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.399> well<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.559> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
where the wires come out well right this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
where the wires come out well right this
is<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> hub<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.210> hook

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
is just the hub all right you can hook

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.569 
is just the hub all right you can hook
up<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.050> lights<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> things<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
up like lights and things to this and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
up like lights and things to this and
what<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.960> something<00:00:40.320> called<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
what I have is something called the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.450 
what I have is something called the
biologic<00:00:41.309> recharge<00:00:42.020> which<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.040> device

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
biologic recharge which is this device

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
biologic recharge which is this device
right<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:44.840> now<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> biologic

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
right here now with the biologic

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.799 
right here now with the biologic
recharge<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> only<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
recharge this is the only thing on the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.560 
recharge this is the only thing on the
market<00:00:48.960> well<00:00:49.890> commercially<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.910> will

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
market well commercially that will

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
market well commercially that will
capture<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.890> power<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> hub<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.550> then

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
capture the power from the hub and then

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
capture the power from the hub and then
you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.660> use<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> charge<00:00:59.059> anything<00:01:00.890> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you can use it to charge anything that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
you can use it to charge anything that
runs<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.030> USP<00:01:03.300> power<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.019> five<00:01:04.290> volts

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
runs off like USP power so five volts

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
runs off like USP power so five volts
and<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.430> explain<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.659> actual

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and to explain that this is the actual

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010 
and to explain that this is the actual
setup<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.180> biological<00:01:09.390> recharge

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
setup here so the biological recharge

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560 
setup here so the biological recharge
wire<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:12.299> actually

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
wire is going to this that actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340 
wire is going to this that actually
unplugs<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.970> converter<00:01:15.840> module

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
unplugs this is the converter module

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649 
unplugs this is the converter module
here<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.189> zip<00:01:17.610> tied<00:01:17.820> temporarily

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
here I just have it zip tied temporarily

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
how much charge you have left right now
I've<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:55.280> two<00:01:56.280> bars<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.880> guess<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I've got two bars I guess but this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.100 
I've got two bars I guess but this
button<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.369> an<00:01:59.520> output<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> push

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
button here is an output so when I push

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.069 
button here is an output so when I push
it<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:02.130> means<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.579> discharging<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.719> it's

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it that means it's discharging so it's

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.330 
it that means it's discharging so it's
discharging<00:02:04.619> even<00:02:04.979> though<00:02:05.040> nothing's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
discharging even though nothing's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
discharging even though nothing's
plugged<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.450> design<00:02:06.810> flaw<00:02:07.079> I'm

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
plugged in is that a design flaw I'm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.249 
plugged in is that a design flaw I'm
just

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
just

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
just
and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.510> have<00:02:11.720> it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and then this one is you have to have it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.040 
and then this one is you have to have it
pushed<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.319> for<00:02:13.099> it<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.280> be<00:02:13.400> charging<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.510> when

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
pushed in for it to be charging so when

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.559 
pushed in for it to be charging so when
there<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.680> power<00:02:15.890> applied<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.300> little

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
there is power applied to that little

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.589 
there is power applied to that little
hole<00:02:17.959> on<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.200> left<00:02:18.379> side<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:20.060> green<00:02:20.360> light

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
hole on the left side the green light

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.140 
hole on the left side the green light
will<00:02:21.140> come<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.379> now<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.069> turn<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.580> but

there's<00:02:23.360> no<00:02:23.480> power<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.090> is

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
there's no power to it so when there is

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.180 
there's no power to it so when there is
when<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.720> bikes<00:02:26.900> actually<00:02:27.319> rolling<00:02:27.560> you'll
