00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.730
 with the glow in the sunset silences 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.430
 deep that inspire a new day for 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.709
 project job opportunities like this 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.990
 it is the dawn in altea the greatness san 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.420
 pedro sacatepéquez place where 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.730
 first thing you hear is the barking of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.230
 dogs and the song of the roosters that is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.170
 the starting point for 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.700
 farmers to start their work 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.710
 preparing the hoe with hat on 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.780
 not to mention the desire to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.850
 leave everything in the field but before 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.800
 all this make a small 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.140
 planning for the distribution of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.270
 labors which talk to the heat 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.340
 of the iron that boils in the water to 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 the making of a rich and hot 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.170
 cup of coffee as the ancestors said 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.540
 so that the gut gets hot from this 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.149
 way with the happy heart guide their 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.130
 steps to the land where they sowed is like this 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.410
 as initiates potato cultivation with 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.809
 The first roast is still born when it has not 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.660
 went out in the sun and when the clock struck 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.329
 the 555 begin to see the first 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.820
 potatoes thanks to the joint work of 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.950
 these wonderful farmers after 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.880
 a few minutes appear the first 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.789
 dolls 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.560
 potatoes with human form in this way the 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.930
 Product increase is more visible 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.970
 thanks to the contribution of women and 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.520
 when the sun comes out with the naked eye it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.920
 You can see an approximate of 10 quintals 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.020
 torn that for them is a 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.020
 blessing of god that we are doing 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:34.159
 to see how much he gave us for rope 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.319
 because the projection is not even in 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.899
 where normal is given something of 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.659
 maintenance as also consciousness 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.659
 renders age but where there is no good 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.659
 maintenance because the earth can not 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.009
 Strive to give a lot if you do not have 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.799
 that being the man that you have to 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.689
 strive to feed the earth the 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.890
 feed the earth then the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.720
 product if it grows and produces good the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.940
 main is organic matter 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.340
 the one of our animals and then then 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.740
 we also incorporated a bit of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.470
 chicken manure and then the chemical that comes to 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.380
 strengthen black to the crop this 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.970
 Wonderful product is of quality 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.830
 thanks to the seed they use that is 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.050
 native of san juan ostuncalco la 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 experience for more than 30 years that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.450
 they have in this art and organic fertilizer 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.870
 which is coming from your animals in my 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 case 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.150
 and then I do not have to do the mixing with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.330
 hens of the mixture is returned and there 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 then 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.959
 he goes to the rattle he values 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.120
 to kill when you call the females 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.730
 and there are the results but the most 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.250
 important for us here is that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.859
 we have to see such a big blessing 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.740
 that no man in the leg can 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:06.830
 provide water only them 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:11.920
 you remember there are 30 36 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:16.310
 but the minimum is from 20 to 25 the minimum 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.900
 but the big ones when I already 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.319
 celebrating 35 times 40 40 quintals per 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.319
 village 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.410
 with 25 30 quintals 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.239
 we are in compliance because they come from there 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.239
 the expenses invested 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.050
 we are used to the profit of 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.480
 the losses to start the potato are 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.910
 they need adequate tools and know 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.310
 where to give the asado nazo because if it is not 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.410
 right there is the danger of damaging the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.320
 good product the one that is most used is 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.540
 our health h and something other objects 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.880
 they can not serve later 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.740
 thank God we have the risk that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.110
 it's a god blessing also because 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.360
 not all of humanity has the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.460
 opportunity to have the blessed water 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.030
 then that do that no longer encourages us 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.860
 to keep working well 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.620
 look at us we bring it from a place 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.400
 which is called chin in the village of san 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.350
 André Capi and we bring him almost to 6 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.840
 kilometers from here where we are to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.150
 births the process of sowing 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.160
 potatoes will not be easy because 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 will provide magnificent results 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.780
 since each plant produces a large 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.060
 number of tubers and it is very easy 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.580
 of cultivate if fertile soils are used 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.449
 with a lot of organic matter that require 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:45.120
 frequent and abundant waterings 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:49.090
 it is a sandy flat terrain that very well 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.570
 left is left maneuvering 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.110
 because there are also clay soils 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.530
 in the clayey sand if not much 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.520
 trust because then the pests appear 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:07.479
 for example the worm and insects 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.310
 suck the leaf and there imaginary pearl 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.280
 here not because here is a flat terrain 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.560
 always keep the humidity good 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.360
 growth throughout the process 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.669
 productive the cultivation of the potato 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.650
 needs fumigation to eliminate 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.780
 pests that appear from moisture and 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.760
 heat mainly has to 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.760
 fight fungi like this 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.190
 thanks to the work of 14 people between 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.590
 they two women managed to start 43 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.710
 quintals with a value of 500 quetzales 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.900
 the load and 9 as they say second 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.310
 for the local market with a cost of 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.310
 130 quetzales 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.100
 the cows 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.250
 after this already being torn 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.889
 to ask for the punching which is 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.249
 take to the place where they are going to buy us 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.889
 the potato the product 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.049
 In this way farmers work 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.599
 that several of them come from different 

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:15.689
 places to grow potatoes such is the case 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.309
 of jaime animal santiago jenner ciriaco 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.409
 and Florentine who show their 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.479
 skills and practices for filling 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.579
 of the gonzález what is never missing in 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.809
 this group of workers is a very 

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.809
 good sense of humor 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.360
 it costs us all pretty realistic 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.650
 d 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.169
 now we just have to wait for the second 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.039
 harvest that still needs irrigation and 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.770
 see if they hire us to go to work 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:53.090
 rigoberto rosco josue ardiano the news 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.090
 what do you want to see
