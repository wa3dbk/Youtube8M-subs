00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.250
 but now we will continue to work and make 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.250
 two more candlesticks 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 of these two vases here we are no longer 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 we will glue anything 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.810
 here we will draw with those paints 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.200
 which I showed at the beginning that is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.629
 so transparent and paint that will 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 further still glow differently 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.690
 since we still 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 New Year is coming then we will draw snowflakes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.230
 we will not be particularly wise though it may 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.230
 be anything 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:01.070
 paint than convenient in this case so 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.059
 what has such a narrow one wears 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.339
 just like a pencil 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.110
 we will draw for those who can not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.650
 just do it by hand, you can 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.220
 draw some image and inside 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.170
 inserting it so it shines through 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 how would you draw it from him 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
 just lightly pencil someone for 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 yourself may mark some outlines 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.210
 pattern and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.119
 modify it directly 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 paint hands 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.939
 can print a piece of paper and just 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.939
 put in front of you to something 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.939
 navigate 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.459
 at the moment I was applied 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.220
 drawing on both of these vases 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.310
 the only thing on matte was it 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:30.170
 transparent paint on transparent vodka 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:33.000
 crew recent on i paint now i will supplement 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.620
 drawing only changing the paint on 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.840
 transparent it will be transparent paint 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.140
 it is not transparent it will be fair cent 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.140
 I will add a little bit of detail 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.220
 spiritual empty places left by 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.549
 us from snowflakes 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:03.180
 small elements just it will be 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:05.340
 small dropping snowflakes and droplets on 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.150
 transparent vases then i will do too 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.040
 most work with paints I finished in 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 we ended up with two such 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 candlestick on frosted candlesticks we 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.530
 worked with transparent or fluorescent 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 paint principle as it is transparent but 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.489
 It turned out two such different effects as 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.340
 you see on the transparent drawing less 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.180
 noticeable that is basically but here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.370
 taken 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.780
 special fluorescent paint 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.190
 which later after shutdown 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.620
 the light will glow 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.540
 if you want more contrast 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.000
 drawing then you can just take 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.440
 paint more saturated color and already 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.010
 complement fluorescent so to speak 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.709
 Come on to get a glow effect. 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.810
 in general, the result of our work today 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.100
 here are these four candlesticks 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.260
 as if in today's lesson I am so 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.629
 tell you shared ideas with you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.400
 and and gave food for thought in 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.140
 Further, you can do it all again. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:17.070
 combine stick and reel base 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.690
 Marbles and or for example like this 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.840
 option supplement drawing with paint 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.870
 mosaic 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.150
 or drawing with mosaic add 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.970
 various color additions and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.160
 dyes of the same fluorescent to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:42.660
 then achieve a glow effect therefore 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.630
 experiment try this 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.370
 New Year's atmosphere can be created 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 by your own hands 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.400
 it can be a gift or for decoration 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.400
 own interior 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.500
 all easy materials are available and all 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.440
 this you can find in art 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.310
 stores in your city 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.260
 look meet ce in ce 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.599
 assortment maybe you'll find there 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:14.280
 a lot of interesting things for themselves but those who are 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:18.020
 previously ordered our paid course and 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.960
 familiarized with the section of the filler stained glass 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:27.470
 can still make an extra here 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.470
 such candlesticks 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.500
 this is probably our lesson is over 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.500
 good to new meetings
