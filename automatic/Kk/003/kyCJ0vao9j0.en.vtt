so after my hair is nice and smooth what
I<00:00:53.930> like<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.350> do<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:54.890> divide<00:00:55.070> my<00:00:55.519> hair<00:00:55.789> in

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
I like to do is just divide my hair in

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.420 
I like to do is just divide my hair in
half<00:00:56.300> first<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.110> then<00:00:57.649> just<00:00:57.769> clip<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.219> top

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
half first and then just clip the top

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.610 
half first and then just clip the top
section<00:00:58.489> out<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.390> way<00:00:59.540> and<00:00:59.839> then<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.290> bottom

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
section out the way and then the bottom

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.380 
section out the way and then the bottom
half<00:01:00.829> I'll<00:01:01.190> divide<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.670> into<00:01:01.850> two<00:01:01.969> sections

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
half I'll divide that into two sections

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.270 
half I'll divide that into two sections
so<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:03.530> begin<00:01:03.680> curling<00:01:04.220> my<00:01:04.339> hair

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
just don't strictly stick to one tool

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.770 
just don't strictly stick to one tool
this<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.990> actual<00:01:32.790> first<00:01:33.790> half<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.420> then

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
this is the actual first half and then

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.690 
this is the actual first half and then
this<00:01:34.870> is<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.110> 32<00:01:35.440> millimeter<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.310> also<00:01:36.460> has<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
this is the 32 millimeter it also has a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.240 
this is the 32 millimeter it also has a
25<00:01:37.300> millimeter<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:38.110> contains<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.980> heat

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
25 millimeter it contains a heat

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.270 
25 millimeter it contains a heat
protecting<00:01:39.730> glove<00:01:39.940> right<00:01:40.270> in<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.540> center<00:01:40.870> and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
then it has the 19 millimeter a smaller

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.050 
then it has the 19 millimeter a smaller
one<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.800> then<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.070> Pearl<00:01:45.400> which<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> one

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
one and then the Pearl which is the one

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.880 
one and then the Pearl which is the one
we're<00:01:46.180> gonna<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.450> using<00:01:46.750> today<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.200> then<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
we're gonna be using today and then the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.490 
we're gonna be using today and then the
reversed<00:01:48.340> one<00:01:48.910> so<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.330> have<00:01:49.600> all<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.900> these<00:01:50.170> in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
reversed one so you have all of these in

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.820 
reversed one so you have all of these in
one<00:01:50.890> place<00:01:51.300> here<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.600> am<00:01:52.900> going<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.230> take<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
one place here I am going to take the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.770 
one place here I am going to take the

your fingers and I'm just gonna start by

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.730 
your fingers and I'm just gonna start by
taking<00:01:58.930> about<00:01:59.170> one<00:01:59.979> inch<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:01.900> hair<00:02:02.260> at<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> time

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
taking about one inch of hair at a time

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.370 
taking about one inch of hair at a time
and<00:02:02.979> just<00:02:03.070> curling<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.850> outward<00:02:04.360> around<00:02:05.229> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
and just curling it outward around the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.030 
and just curling it outward around the
Pearl<00:02:05.710> barrel<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.930> as<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.290> see<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.770> heats

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
Pearl barrel and as you can see it heats

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.300 
Pearl barrel and as you can see it heats
up<00:02:09.220> really<00:02:09.399> fast<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.650> it<00:02:11.650> doesn't<00:02:12.160> take<00:02:12.280> a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
up really fast and it doesn't take a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.800 
up really fast and it doesn't take a
long<00:02:12.520> time<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.210> get<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.510> really

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
long time for you to get that really

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.740 
long time for you to get that really
nice<00:02:14.080> structured<00:02:14.680> curl<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.510> something

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
nice structured curl which is something

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
one of the most tedious things to do is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.550 
one of the most tedious things to do is
to<00:02:21.280> do<00:02:21.580> your<00:02:21.910> hair<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:23.050> have<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.530> a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
to do your hair and we have to do a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.740 
to do your hair and we have to do a
process<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.970> want<00:02:25.239> tools<00:02:25.540> that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
process like this you want tools that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.660 
process like this you want tools that
heat<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.050> fast<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:27.580> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
heat up really fast and you don't have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.670 
heat up really fast and you don't have
to<00:02:27.850> hold<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.239> around<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.050> barrel<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> long

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
to hold it around the barrel for a long

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.140 
to hold it around the barrel for a long
time<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.220> doesn't<00:02:30.489> cause<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> lot<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.910> heat

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
time so it doesn't cause a lot of heat

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.350 
time so it doesn't cause a lot of heat
damage<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.920> I'm<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.459> going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> repeat<00:02:34.120> this
