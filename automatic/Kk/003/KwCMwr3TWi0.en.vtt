00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello friends, good afternoon, we are here 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.059
 answering questions that arise as 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 Throughout the week until the day very 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.370
 nice everything will be much more illuminated 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 now better camera better resolution one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.539
 life a little more white but good 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.970
 Our friend Mario asks us 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.720
 the day a long time ago but good 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.289
 hello I hope my inbox is read is 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.329
 read 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.440
 I want to lose weight and yet is not 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.660
 because you spend the following does not want 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 lose is fat and does not want to lose 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.350
 muscle mass that's the subject I suppose 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 what do you want to give to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 understand with that and it seems that my 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.680
 physical is the skinny I do not want and not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 I want but I want to mark if I do not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 may accent I do not understand well but that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.579
 I want to mark I do bars but did not mark 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.149
 it took a lot I would like to be guided 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.430
 I run like 30 minutes without stopping mojo 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.570
 the shirt then I do back and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.340
 abdomen and abdomen interspersed ok monday 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.150
 and Wednesday Chest and Tuesday and Thursday 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 back 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.550
 Friday I kill myself in abdomen and daily I do 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.170
 abdomen series so you make a 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 chingo abdomen and do not work arms 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.720
 no legs but I think it's worth someone 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 a very very serious subject 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 primary 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.770
 not since running 30 minutes never if you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 you want a marked physical if you want a 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.290
 physical 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.750
 aesthetic worked fitness type no 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.880
 you can run 30 minutes as much as 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.820
 you can do is the training that is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 called hit he &amp; it that is the training 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.189
 of cardiovascular intercalated because it is 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.100
 a training in which you run 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.780
 for 30 or 40 seconds maximum and 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.149
 you rest a minute or so depends 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.630
 of your physical condition the issue is that if 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:09.140
 you start running during 2010 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.519
 even 10 even 5 minutes your body 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.890
 it starts that it's going to burn the glycogen 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.750
 muscle and starts to burn the muscle 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.030
 then per is first burn 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.310
 glycogen and then we go fat if 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.040
 aerobic exercise but if 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 we transformed an exercise that should 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.069
 be for our requirement 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 for what we want you to do sculpting 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.099
 a physicist 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 more aesthetic with muscle quality more 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.760
 defined if we convert that exercise into 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 this type of exercise 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.959
 in something that is anaerobic or something 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.640
 aerobic in something anaerobic what we 're going 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.500
 to do is destroy muscle for example 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.110
 a great example is the physicist of a 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.400
 marathoner versus the physicist of a 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.200
 sprinter image of the physicist of a 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.849
 sprinter as it is from the guys that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.849
 they run 100 meters in the Olympics 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.920
 this asafa powell the world champion 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.390
 We knew people in bolt are very 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.330
 muscle are people that maybe measure 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.490
 85 weighs 90 kilos of muscle 80 and 85 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.620
 kilos of muscle are people who work 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.209
 intervals are people who are never going to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.540
 see running a marathon we will never see 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.370
 running suddenly a race of 10 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.800
 kilometers of 20 are people who do 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.990
 a lot of geometric work does work for 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.390
 Weights is even made of almost 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.090
 any sprinter must be able to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.239
 do 200 kilos in squat this 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.920
 it means that in order to have a 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.480
 physical resemblance of a sprinter that is the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.370
 physical really that a lot of people 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.570
 I would like to aspire is a physical marked 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.390
 a very good physicist his physique very 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.070
 functional very aesthetic very nice there 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.570
 that work at intervals that wants 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.640
 say never never run more than 12 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.040
 Maximum minutes also depends on jogging 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.420
 it's one thing to run is another jog to very 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.769
 low speed if it can be done or 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.110
 walk fast which is what I do 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.030
 but get to run riotously 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.239
 that had a heart rate increase 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.280
 at 150 160 beats per minute during 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.150
 a lot of time what to do is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.680
 destroys the precious muscle tissue and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.040
 increase the fat with which never 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.340
 you 'll never never really be able to get there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.730
 to your physical objective and the other case 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.650
 extreme is the case of the marathon runner 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.139
 the person or the elbow the runner 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.690
 background the person who runs 8 kilometers 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.880
 10 kilometers and with a marathon that runs 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.950
 a half marathon look at the physicist of 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.960
 a person like that be I make this analogy 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.180
 because it really is what you have to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.949
 that you have to see how to be 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.810
 you can compare then and you can know 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.400
 because it's not good to run for half 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.870
 ok time that is the main point of 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.940
 this question of this is good 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.780
 asks then the physicist of a 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.980
 marathoner like this 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.320
 full of oxidized free radicals not 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.960
 has muscle a marathoner can measure 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.720
 that's why an average height of 80 235 and 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.000
 will weigh 60 kilos 65 has no mass 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.669
 muscle has a level of fat and 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.669
 possibly higher than a sprinter 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.990
 or that of a physicist or a bodybuilder or a 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.780
 person who is dedicated as a 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.590
 gymnast ok why because he spends his time 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.169
 doing aerobic exercise during 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.650
 a lot of time it becomes anaerobic 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.260
 and therefore burns muscle mass and for 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.900
 it goes up the body chiffon that happens 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.300
 also one thing when the when the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.690
 muscle goes up low fat that always 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.490
 it's like that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.919
 that is a balance how much more muscle 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.690
 you have more less grace about is having 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.940
 why muscles metabolically a lot 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.669
 more active than fat and muscle is 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.010
 literally eat the fat if we have a 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.930
 very high percentage of fat is going to be a 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.460
 little more difficult to develop us either 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.460
 it means that you can not ok 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.410
 that's the subject the subject is basically the 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.479
 big mistake is do not run number one 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.770
 walk fast until your cardio is 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.949
 excellent cardio does a job 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.810
 incredible but above all, walk fast 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.840
 ok look analytics and you want to see 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.910
 spend with the dog go for a walk 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.830
 or treadmill or bicycle at home or what 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.539
 you have not upload the trick you 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.599
 hide from your maximum beats more or 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:10.810
 less you must be 30 years old or 25 may be 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.970
 that you are in 125 but 35 beats per 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.580
 maximum minute that you should use to 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.580
 burn fat without burning muscle that 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.860
 it's the big point here and the other one is 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.300
 train every day obviously I have 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.949
 to train the whole body obviously 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.860
 that you can not train only chest 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.539
 chest and back 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.219
 there must be some reason to 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.939
 obviously train all the whole body 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:35.729
 the shoulder the breastpiece the arms the 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:38.009
 abdomen back legs ok all 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.620
 it's a set so good I hope 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.159
 have solved your doubt and we see the 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.159
 next week
