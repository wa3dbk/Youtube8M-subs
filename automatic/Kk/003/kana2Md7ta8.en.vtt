00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.070
 no friends of youtube I am display 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.529
 resent welcome to this example I have 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.710
 commented halo 4 and good the subject of 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.349
 today it is very very simple but to the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.470
 very lucid time because it is so 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.130
 look at this topic before I say what 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.010
 I obviously took out the transmission in 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 where a subscriber 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 well excited he thrilled to play like that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.980
 and many people started to surround us 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.670
 that is, there are many people here on youtube 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.030
 that put read in the form of that gave laughter 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.359
 the boy even liked them because 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.109
 I was in full fencing and he was 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.269
 I put out happy I do not know how to say it and 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.039
 many were there they remember it but 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.589
 what happened what happened after what 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.920
 they started to surround some so 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.960
 normal as any policeman that we 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.409
 says anything even others 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.040
 youtubers but then nothing nothing that 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.040
 take with importance not because it is 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.900
 are jokes that then 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 time is going to forget and that we do not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.190
 affect 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.190
 they are the simple people they are 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.620
 let's say insignificant things but there were 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.020
 other kind of people that if the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.170
 they surrounded thus over lucidly not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 it went mercilessly let's say it like that then 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.390
 because it's half dangerous I realized 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.450
 this from youtube because because 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.670
 I can simply do an action 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.520
 you are exposing yourself to many people not yes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.869
 yes, where you upload a video and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.609
 at the moment because of error rather you 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.439
 You show the number of your house or samples 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.909
 your address especially the number of your 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.979
 home or your cell phone obviously not 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.530
 they are going to tell you that this has already happened to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.899
 field with this and it had happened to her 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 that in the middle of transmission you read you are not 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.549
 he put the microphone and then he asked 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.830
 I think a pizza and he gave his number 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.470
 and when he gave his number they started him 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.990
 to call subscribers they called his 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.140
 home and it 's like that 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.060
 of each stand are talking to me and then 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 I think it's dangerous means this is not 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.010
 you do not have to give a lot of data 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.530
 so personal neither reserve tea 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.330
 do not even leave you because then 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.250
 then people will not know you and 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.170
 it will not know who is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.910
 Well you will be forgetting on YouTube 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 another youtube or more but it's very very 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.410
 and very dangerous all this from youtube in 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.420
 security issue of this that they 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.390
 I say why because maybe you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.880
 they are subscribers not in reynosa 13 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.520
 years 17 years there will be some bigger ones 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.350
 guys and well, they do not care 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.870
 watching the video so if they do not see it well and 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.970
 everything but there may be people there are always 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.770
 bad people and already here then I can see 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 people who have other purposes not others 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.690
 purposes of later extracting information from 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.120
 classic nortel that not that should not 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.640
 happen but unfortunately it happens then 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.250
 because you can not be risking 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 show so many so many things 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.430
 let's say your facet in what comes 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.130
 being youtube 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.320
 this also had already made clear of 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.660
 another way to xl in a video already has 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.390
 time that video where he said that 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370
 YouTubers as they are not at 100% 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.040
 conversion into reality many times 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.610
 this is a character or I can not 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.140
 go there on the street and look less 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.420
 being lucido in the jeep but to 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.130
 anyone because because it is not 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
 Now I know who my channel is not my 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.970
 character no or you do not have to either 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.430
 pretend I know someone else on youtube 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.120
 or you have to be 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.150
 you have to think what obviously you 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.159
 you feel and everything and express what but have 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 Take care of all that kind of stuff because 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.849
 yes yes I was quite surprised by this 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.939
 type of reactions since then only 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.549
 they were a few minutes of lucidity and a lot 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.010
 4 people read it and I do not know how much for me 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.930
 part because there is nothing to do or are 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.450
 villas that happen here on youtube all 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.539
 can happen to us and then x are not or not 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.639
 The importance is so important, but there is 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.979
 be very careful about this as 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.009
 as I said and always people that is 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.539
 who surround the other people who in 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.169
 they are doing it in a bad way 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.479
 then it can not be one hundred percent 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.150
 yourself on youtube is more a character 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.210
 this and that is why also many 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.970
 Sometimes youtubers including me 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.280
 we say induced things that normally 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.160
 you do not listen and that's also how 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.690
 we call attention or be you you call 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.300
 the attention because because you're going to listen 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.099
 something not a person in front of you 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.000
 he's going to tell you if not through a 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.560
 video through him 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.720
 commented through anything a 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.570
 videoblog whatever it is going to show you 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.330
 something that interests you or something lucid and 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.570
 something good that does not have anything 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.930
 see when with things so from life 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.540
 real for telling you like that so it's not going to 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.700
 be 100% the same person if it is not a 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.680
 character is a facet this 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.240
 youtube but also recommendation not 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.120
 obviously pretending to be someone else or 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.300
 is simply to express what you 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.550
 you think that's very important but with 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.470
 those limits have no limits here in 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.110
 youtube well it was a short gameplay 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.730
 comment subscribe to children up and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.070
 let me down here what you think of everything 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.960
 this of all these lucidity and of what 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.960
 wave is that it goes with this then thank you 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.930
 comes and comes alone with this that 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.240
 I simply bring before you 1,7 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.980
 meters with the accounts that show the 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.860
 who faces the water more clearly 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.080
 created and poured 60 in forgiven for 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.120
 leave us without nation restless and mini tops 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.790
 see what you see that is not so much bill 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.340
 is killing every newbie garbage that 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.110
 boast or do not have seamless 10 and what 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.240
 they support Indian child are prescribed 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.490
 many liars steps well wants what 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.560
 challenge to see what is brother to see 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.750
 that fit many have come like you 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.790
 and he has not stooped since a good time 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.650
 started to grab the eggs but I did not 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.260
 Always misunderstand with your feet in the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.260
 I usually help that it deserves effort
