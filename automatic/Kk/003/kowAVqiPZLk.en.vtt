00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 cognac like you would like to have a 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.650
 pergola mouse wooden poles 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.470
 serving as a support for beautiful 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.630
 plants a nice little terrace in 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 makes a small mistake I see you have 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 already started indeed I do not know 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
 how to continue but I see that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 started in any case he here it takes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750
 add two poles I propose to you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.619
 fix them immediately 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.359
 it's perfect ok that's the one here 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.750
 here and we fix it there with the help of a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.130
 flange 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.779
 we have to make sure that these 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.070
 poles be properly aligned it does not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 do not have to be one like that and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.349
 the other one like that for that we're going 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 use a cord 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.309
 just stretch the rope and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 to align the poles on this one 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 determined in advance the length of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 pergola divide this length in part 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 equal the poles of this period there is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 find in this case to one meter twenty 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 each other's property they are 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.930
 aligned and well against the cord 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 ok you can fix them and now the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 poles must protrude from the ground on a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 distance from 180 to 200 cm they are fixed 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 in the hard bracket using flanges 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.989
 if you place your pergola on a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 furniture rack makes holes in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.130
 this one using an auger and fix 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.790
 the posts using mortars or 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.790
 quick setting cement 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.470
 ok these beams can come here you want 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.270
 well hold it like that I could 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:40.860
 life is like that it's over 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.040
 now we are going to fix the solid 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.180
 next 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.770
 now this beam is placed 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.240
 at its posts the pole of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.680
 middle seems to me to be the one who most 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.480
 down I want to hold this beam at 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 same level as the upper face and 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.080
 as well in the middle as it is the beam 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 central but I hold it like that in 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.860
 the air I place the water level by 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 above and like that we indicate the height 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 from this post ok I already take it there way 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 in the middle and perfectly the same 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.530
 level as the upper side 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 I place at aa level or here it is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 a level I said that's this place and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.610
 the middle is here down is taking the pole 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.900
 the shortest for reference 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.520
 like that it is certain that the beam 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.190
 can be properly placed against 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.739
 all the poles in the middle of each 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.489
 post it will take a hole and sets the soul 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.489
 yves at the posts 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.659
 now it must also and all 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.220
 poles at the same height 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.290
 everything above the soul 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.000
 yves side has finished now we 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.349
 let's do this side there cost back there 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.790
 against the wall or did you want 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.260
 the place is actually a little higher 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.730
 that in order to have a slope 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.650
 ok do you want to be introduced 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 against the wall yeah now we're 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.170
 already more oh there for me it's 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.849
 perfect 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.319
 ok we'll put a water level by 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.090
 on this place where strong the holes 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.849
 and then we get strong in the wall and we fix to 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 using a chemical hockey ink to 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.750
 using a water level 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 make sure the beam and straight 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:36.129
 start by drilling a hole in the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:43.930
 beam up against the wall a single 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:45.519
 point on the wall is enough now we 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.940
 let's drill strait this place with 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.940
 the other wick 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.200
 bass will fix this beam with a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.180
 chemical ink 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 he injects resin to two 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.400
 components in the hole and sinks into it 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.440
 then divinity eliminate the resin 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.350
 excess and let it dry all 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.640
 for 20 minutes to half an hour 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.640
 you can then fix the beam 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.019
 first on your side move the beam 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.120
 on the threaded rods is fixed there 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.120
 securely with a washer and a nut 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.589
 know you may have noticed that 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.550
 I tried these beams bevel 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:47.789
 so that it fits perfectly 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.529
 against the wall 1 that's fine this is 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.300
 naturally not necessary if the roof 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.300
 from your pergola and right by following 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.949
 base starts with setting all the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.639
 slats on one side they fixed them in the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.129
 soul yves who is anchored to the wall then he 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.449
 does the same thing on the other side the 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.119
 slats are arranged at the same distance 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.360
 from each other to know every 60 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:23.339
 cm low life without sequel la slats to 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:24.689
 poles ok this wood is impregnated he has 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.249
 so already been treated but it would be nice 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.569
 that you also treat it yourself 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.669
 both years it is also necessary 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.860
 treat the sides placed two fronts can 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.339
 to be even already now ok let's go there 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.909
 to arrive m 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.909
 in fact
