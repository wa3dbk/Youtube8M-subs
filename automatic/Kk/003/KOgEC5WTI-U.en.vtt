00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 all greetings by already developed 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.429
 traditions show you work without 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 backsticks but just came out crosses 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.070
 here now is half past two I am sitting 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.920
 happy because this is probably my 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.000
 the most favorite moment when everything is already 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.539
 crosses can be embroidered with a clear conscience 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.369
 put all the strings in place 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.829
 leave only black and cam for 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.610
 back and start it with ecstasy to embroider 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.530
 I will also embroider as last times 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 gamma threads for backstitch not on it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.360
 I like it very much and critics myself 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 performed 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.700
 dms thread well, I'll tell you about it 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.030
 went to make bull soon the wine turned out 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.020
 me here is such a magnet at all 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 it was supposed to be a card 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 but I did not find the right one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 blanks for postcards and I thought how 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.490
 did this all began to look in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.850
 internet and stumbled upon 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.670
 master class both from ordinary and embroidery on 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 usual comp make a magnet and made 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 there it was proposed to stick a few 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.229
 layers of nonwoven to be seen and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 wrong side and so that he became more tightly a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.590
 edges to glue for 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.530
 glue stick processed in principle 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.740
 pike perch looks fine and stuck 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.619
 magnet on double-sided tape was not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.380
 Such a magnet magazine in my Diana 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.290
 creative was a magazine and here it was 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 billet inside which could 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.329
 use on this not on the fridge 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.820
 is hanging 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:02.579
 so it turned out this here magnet 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.610
 scheme from the book that you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.500
 told 20 mini embroidery from Mike 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.369
 polo 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.030
 such a shot 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.360
 Since I embroidered magnet as a gift 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.640
 the same girlfriend who houses it 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120
 began to follow the original key 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.790
 here the anchor strings and picked up the threads 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.440
 which I basically embroidered these 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.530
 houses but in addition to this one thing here 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.780
 I'm already just from my stock of the hall 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.870
 strings basically turned out well as 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.540
 the magnet is combined with those works so 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.299
 that I will give it all together when I 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.049
 just thought to embroider these 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.549
 pictures then they want them like that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:58.549
 so here that look in one 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.799
 a vertical row on the wall would hang 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.140
 but now they are just on the floor 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.110
 laid to show you now 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.370
 I'll take a closer look at each picture so this 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:15.680
 looks like if you look closer 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.380
 there is a double mat and the most common as 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.970
 I said the girl who works 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.370
 batch workshop frame she is not herself 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.959
 I picked up the design with each for the first time 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.319
 the cops don't really know what we tried of 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.010
 choose white mats so michael himself 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.900
 draws out well, somehow the embroidery was lost we 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.900
 decided all the same here is a little gray 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.209
 pick up and select anti-glare glass 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.450
 see it is almost invisible as 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.940
 as if this glass and not for 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.239
 I gave one picture 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.440
 it turns out there 62,000 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:04.489
 Well, do not worry this Belarusian rubles 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:09.829
 Russian is about 235 rubles or 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:15.590
 somewhere everyone with pennies there dollars to me 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:17.479
 I like what happened principle I hope 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.549
 that a friend like her already 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.100

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:35.520

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:38.640
 mya is such a mount gave more 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.520
 his other works take shape also 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:47.300
 Dunno but it took another day to you 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:50.370

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.970

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.460
 I'm glad that I managed to do everything on time 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.440

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.620

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.230
