let's take a look inside
and<00:00:35.870> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.050> why<00:00:37.260> besides<00:00:38.129> putting<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and this is why besides putting the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.840 
and this is why besides putting the
drill<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> bigger<00:00:39.629> sustainer<00:00:40.700> caster<00:00:41.700> has

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
drill in a bigger sustainer caster has

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
drill in a bigger sustainer caster has
also<00:00:42.059> come<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.690> new<00:00:42.870> compact<00:00:43.260> charger

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
also come up with a new compact charger

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
also come up with a new compact charger
and<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.309> also<00:00:44.520> made<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.210> completely<00:00:45.870> new

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and they are also made a completely new

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
and they are also made a completely new
bottom<00:00:46.739> tray<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> coming<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
bottom tray and I will be coming back to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.930 
bottom tray and I will be coming back to
that<00:00:49.890> later

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that later

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
55 minutes the big thing about this is

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.180 
55 minutes the big thing about this is
it's<00:05:37.470> smaller<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:39.300> get<00:05:39.510> this<00:05:39.690> nice

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
it's smaller and you get this nice

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.010 
it's smaller and you get this nice
storage<00:05:41.190> for<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.640> 2<00:05:41.880> meter<00:05:42.090> long<00:05:42.120> cord<00:05:42.660> around

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
storage for the 2 meter long cord around

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.430 
storage for the 2 meter long cord around
it<00:05:43.640> we<00:05:44.640> have<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:44.910> hook<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.330> secures<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.140> cord

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
it we have a hook that secures the cord

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.240 
it we have a hook that secures the cord
foam<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.150> unwrapping<00:05:48.150> itself<00:05:49.100> so<00:05:50.100> it's

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
foam and unwrapping itself so it's

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.460 
foam and unwrapping itself so it's
really<00:05:50.460> nice<00:05:50.580> on<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:51.270> back<00:05:51.300> we<00:05:51.600> have<00:05:51.630> two

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
really nice on the back we have two

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.240 
really nice on the back we have two
holes<00:05:52.740> for<00:05:52.919> mounting<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.790> on<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.120> wall<00:05:54.630> or<00:05:55.380> if

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
holes for mounting it on the wall or if

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.070 
holes for mounting it on the wall or if
you<00:05:56.400> have<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.580> charging<00:05:57.090> station<00:05:57.240> or<00:05:57.720> whatever

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
you have a charging station or whatever

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.260 
you have a charging station or whatever
so<00:05:59.040> you<00:05:59.100> can<00:05:59.280> mount<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.580> up<00:05:59.640> there<00:05:59.910> with<00:06:00.090> 2

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
so you can mount it up there with 2

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.200 
so you can mount it up there with 2
screws<00:06:00.740> so<00:06:01.740> it's<00:06:01.890> really<00:06:02.040> nice<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.760> smaller

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
screws so it's really nice the smaller

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.630 
screws so it's really nice the smaller
size<00:06:03.660> also<00:06:04.050> contributes<00:06:04.710> to<00:06:05.010> making<00:06:05.250> more

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
size also contributes to making more

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.630 
size also contributes to making more
space<00:06:05.970> in<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:07.440> sustainer<00:06:07.860> so<00:06:08.220> let's<00:06:08.580> have

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
space in the the sustainer so let's have

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.260 
space in the the sustainer so let's have
a<00:06:08.729> look<00:06:08.820> at<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.790> the<00:06:12.000> new

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
a look at that and this is the new

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.830 
a look at that and this is the new
storage<00:06:12.810> area<00:06:13.820> these<00:06:14.820> boxes<00:06:15.330> are<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.660> same
