00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 as a player 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.970
 comes to the end of his turn dominated one of the blows and the mechanics of colors is only 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.870
 the beginning of the game here to the best style outside metroidvania generates secrets to

 to explore 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 when I took one of the colors you are not seen by shots those things 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.890
 these platforms the sector has no debts 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890
 you still need to trust your enemies 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.680
 in the beginning it is difficult but after a few hours change from correction to copy and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.290
 change color again to reach a new platform all in fractions of 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 according to the sector not natural activities 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.660
 the pace of the game is simple 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.650
 with just the silhouette of the hero of his enemies on a beautiful colored background 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.030
 the movement is fluid and the light effects complement excellent direction

 artistic author 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 then the game a public personality 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.169
 in a way the toucan resembles limbo but with much more curious 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.690
 despite the beautiful media view 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.969
 the challenge taken 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.099
 of inspirations a classic of the most varied

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.829
 no more than a priority
