arbitration etc but we do have a new

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.109 
arbitration etc but we do have a new
potential<00:00:17.010> system<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.000> see

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
potential system so here as you can see

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.820 
potential system so here as you can see
Sidney<00:00:18.510> Crosby<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.930> potential<00:00:19.439> rating<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
Sidney Crosby a potential rating of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.529 
Sidney Crosby a potential rating of
franchise<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> highest<00:00:21.330> potential

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
franchise this is the highest potential

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.700 
franchise this is the highest potential
rating<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.930> game<00:00:22.140> obviously<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
rating in the game obviously it's a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
rating in the game obviously it's a
player<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.250> build<00:00:23.850> your<00:00:23.939> team

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
player that you can build your team

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
player that you can build your team
around<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> head<00:00:24.900> soil<00:00:25.199> player<00:00:25.470> can

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
around and the head soil player can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
around and the head soil player can
possibly<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.310> turn<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> around<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.119> your

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
possibly just turn it around for your

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
possibly just turn it around for your
entire<00:00:27.449> club<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.410> sure<00:00:28.470> how<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.160> know

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
entire club so I'm not sure how you know

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.400 
entire club so I'm not sure how you know
accurate<00:00:29.460> these<00:00:29.760> potentials<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
accurate these potentials are all the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.749 
accurate these potentials are all the
potentials<00:00:31.859> are<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.099> white<00:00:32.250> text<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.700> I'm

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
potentials are some white text so I'm

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
potentials are some white text so I'm
assuming<00:00:33.000> they're<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:33.600> accurate<00:00:33.809> or

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
assuming they're pretty accurate or

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
assuming they're pretty accurate or
maybe<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.040> know<00:00:35.130> they'll<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.399> different<00:00:35.579> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
maybe you know they'll be different in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
maybe you know they'll be different in
GM<00:00:36.090> oh<00:00:36.180> they'll<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.630> white<00:00:36.899> text<00:00:37.350> red

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
GM oh they'll be like white text red

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
GM oh they'll be like white text red
text<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.879> unsure<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:40.079> far<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.410> we

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
text so it's unsure but as far as we

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
text so it's unsure but as far as we
know<00:00:40.680> right<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.090> tells<00:00:42.420> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
once you get past 87 you're kind of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
once you get past 87 you're kind of
looking<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.270> elite<00:01:06.510> player<00:01:06.659> next<00:01:07.560> guys<00:01:07.710> you
