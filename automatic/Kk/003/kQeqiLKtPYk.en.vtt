00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.420
 more guys we are in a new video in 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 this video can explain before 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.900
 explain 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.100
 how to win universe 1 in counter strike 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.080
 well there are 3 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.690
 simple techniques that are very 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.370
 important to win 1 2 1 and good 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.260
 let's start with the first one that is 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.900
 high good to jump is the most 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.390
 bad of this game so I do not 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.360
 I recommend using basically because 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.239
 when shooting is for the bullets it 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.239
 shoot too much then no enemy 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.269
 in which the bullets look pretty like that 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.190
 that's why that's why I recommend it 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.400
 to be this rule 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.740
 I recommend doing so 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.500
 the truth that I now always occupied like this 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.290
 when an enemy is left then at 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.730
 jump shooting have more chance 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.200
 to win since you are attending the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.540
 bullets of the enemy as I am 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.750
 showing now I recommend it 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.820
 use well and has very good 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.130
 results and good with this death 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.430
 we go to the second technique that is 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 bending over no doubt ducking is the best 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.950
 technique to win the universe 1 since 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.440
 When you look down from your weapon, 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.170
 shrink or you will have more precision and 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 you can easily beat the enemy 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.130
 we will use over long distances and 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.800
 stockings as I'm saying in these 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 examples this technique helps us to 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.160
 short distances since if you 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.020
 Crouching the enemy will be close and the 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.300
 enemy we have possibility of dis part 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 the Belgian will soir you and in this game if you 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.140
 they give a shot in the head 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 good and that's why we're going to use the last one 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.540
 technique of all that is death from side to 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.180
 side 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.180
 we will use this technique to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.330
 for short distances later they will see 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 how this technique is done and why 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.119
 use good is used for a simple reason and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.280
 that there is no other technique 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.090
 jumping and bending over is not effective in 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.610
 short distances 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 there is only one technique left that is 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.870
 stay still and between that quiet and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.430
 move obviously we're going to see each other because 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 let's dodge the bullets of the enemy 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.260
 basically and this was all three 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 main counter-strike techniques 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.090
 if they do well they can win 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.769
 easily 1 2 and 1 so I do not expect that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.819
 he liked it and we'll see you until 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.819
 next goodbye
