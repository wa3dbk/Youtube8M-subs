00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.490
 no to netscape 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.990
 no 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.090
 the announcement of the addition of a modality 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.590
 multiplayer in the tomb raider reboot has 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.430
 aroused the curiosity of all 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.680
 insiders 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.600
 that of the beautiful lara is in fact a 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.980
 exquisitely single player series 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.540
 a series that has at its heart 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.129
 development experience of the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.790
 history and exploration of settings 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.559
 suggestive 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 therefore difficult to imagine one 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.070
 transposition for more players 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.930
 the challenge they have decided to face 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.910
 guys from eidos montreal is certainly not from 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.290
 fire and to find out how they are going 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 things ahead of the next one 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 title distribution we flew to 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.210
 london to challenge the fact of seeing 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.019
 what do they have in store for us? 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.019
 Canadian developers 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.770
 it is useless to deny it after the first dazzling 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.910
 chapters able to change forever 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.650
 the world of video games 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.330
 the series of tomb raiders failed to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 to maintain the quality standard to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 early levels 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 the reasons for this journey are due 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 to multiple factors all to push 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 towards the need for a renewal that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 although respectful of the origins he knew 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.550
 bring back the British archaeologist e 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 glories of the past 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.000
 it was there during the presentation 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.410
 explained that the structure of the game is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 It was built around three pillars 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.119
 the main platform in the puzzles 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.619
 environmental and combat like 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.240
 you may have already guessed in ours 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.920
 previous previews it is a 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.119
 recipe that seems capable of bringing to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.520
 step with the last year and without the times 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.729
 distorting it a quantum actualization is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 necessary but how it fits into everything 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.150
 this is the multiplayer heart of the tomb 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 raider is represented without a shadow of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.610
 doubt of the story of lara from his 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.350
 adventures 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.300
 but the beautiful protagonist is not alone in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 his exploring the island with her are there 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.140
 other survivors against her do not 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.840
 few ill-intentioned two factions 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.400
 therefore the two teams are bound to clash 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.690
 surviving scavengers will have 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.850
 peculiar skills and of course 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.260
 particular objectives 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.239
 to complement the more classic modes 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.040
 of play almost all against all and the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 deathmatch which we will in fact have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 specific types of clashes designed 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.950
 to create asymmetrical situations 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
 we could get our hands on that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.370
 which seemed a variation on the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.720
 theme of capture the flag in which 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.730
 a team that of the survivors 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 had the goal of recovering five 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.840
 cases of medicines distributed for the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.180
 map obviously avoiding the companion in 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.519
 opponent intent on totaling 20 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 kills at a first glance can 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.820
 seem to be the two goals 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.980
 unbalanced but here come into play the 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.630
 different capacities of the two teams 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.250
 the ska sell themselves in fact to succeed to 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.200
 kill an opponent must do in 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.209
 two times before landing it then finishing 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.739
 with a melee attack it is 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.570
 an operation that requires more expertise 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.160
 than you seem since you survived 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.870
 and can continue to shoot the earth 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.459
 and above all they can be helped by 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.900
 their teammates with one 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.790
 practical dose of medicines for 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.350
 put them back on the fact that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.760
 cases to be recovered one appears 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.590
 time means that they can develop 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.690
 interesting procurement situations of 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.160
 team tactics situations traps 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.530
 in which the collaboration between the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.330
 participants and ingredients 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.190
 is able to make a difference if there 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.780
 interesting found Valencian mode 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.580
 the system known to the structure of the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.050
 multiplayer compartment is definitely more 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.670
 traditional in its management of 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.050
 special skill levels thanks to 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.370
 scoring system that causes i 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.140
 players gain an experience e 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.000
 can thus unlock the possibility of 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.610
 make new because new weapons to 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.260
 new upgrades the arsenal is everything 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.780
 added heterogeneous although perhaps not 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.010
 enough but it goes from the normal guns to the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.360
 pump shotguns passing through 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.700
 grenade launchers and machine guns 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.739
 the whole common seasoned proximity 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.780
 spend and water and arrows each player 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.489
 he then has at his disposal two slots from 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.530
 filling converts able to improve 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.700
 resistance increase speed e 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.200
 away saying 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.300
 along an already familiar path for 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 all of us when we jump in 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.840
 fray however it is difficult not to notice 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.739
 of the single player origin of the system 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.760
 control 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.500
 a system that does not appear 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.330
 particularly suitable for frenzy 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.560
 clashes with other human players 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.360
 to this must be added some 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.190
 inaccuracies in IT box management 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.510
 and above all the general feeling that 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.950
 your commands do not get one 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.390
 answer photo from the software 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.830
 all aspects that do not spoil 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.030
 the playful experience but there is also the 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.650
 make it less enjoyable 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.989
 then we know that the time available 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 of developers is practically finished 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.050
 since we are really the last 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.460
 days before the review phase of the 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.229
 product and there is no more space for 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.760
 last minute improvements we look at 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.530
 so hopefully to a continuous 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.060
 support after launch that goes from 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.710
 fix the bumps of a multiplayer 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.820
 which net of these would also be 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.820
 able to fully convince 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.160
 cricket
