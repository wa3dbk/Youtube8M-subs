makes<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> big<00:00:27.570> difference<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.050> how<00:00:28.140> the

fantastically high-performing finish

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
fantastically high-performing finish
that<00:00:33.510> isn't<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> tough<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> put<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.219> ER<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that isn't if it's tough to put on ER it

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
that isn't if it's tough to put on ER it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
isn't put on well it doesn't look very

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.490 
isn't put on well it doesn't look very
good<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.800> therefore<00:00:38.579> people<00:00:38.940> might<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.960> prone

to<00:00:40.530> reject<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> concrete<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to reject that concrete because of the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
to reject that concrete because of the
way<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> looks<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:44.160> may<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.460> unfair<00:00:44.879> because

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
way it looks which may be unfair because

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.619 
way it looks which may be unfair because
that<00:00:45.480> same<00:00:45.690> coating<00:00:45.950> put<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:48.390> look

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that same coating put on well could look

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
that same coating put on well could look
like<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.440> even<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.789> let's<00:00:50.910> run

through some of the basic chemistry's of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
brands there's different versions and

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.359 
brands there's different versions and
many<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> properties<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:09.060> shared<00:01:09.510> across

sometimes<00:01:14.670> there's<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:15.000> differences<00:01:15.450> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sometimes there's some differences but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
sometimes there's some differences but
in<00:01:16.320> general<00:01:16.710> acrylics<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.939> common

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in general acrylics are very common

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
in general acrylics are very common
because<00:01:18.570> they're<00:01:18.869> single<00:01:19.259> component<00:01:19.770> there's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because they're single component there's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
because they're single component there's
only<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.729> bottle<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> mix

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
only one bottle you don't have to mix

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.240 
only one bottle you don't have to mix
anything<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> measure<00:01:22.830> anything

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

therefore<00:01:24.720> water-based<00:01:25.110> versions<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
therefore water-based versions and

usually used under some other finish

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.199 
usually used under some other finish
because<00:04:15.140> they're<00:04:15.950> very<00:04:16.280> scrap<00:04:16.669> prone<00:04:17.030> to

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
because they're very scrap prone to

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.349

scratching<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:18.530> epoxies<00:04:19.130> mostly<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.239> I'm

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
scratching and epoxies mostly and I'm

scratching and epoxies mostly and I'm
talking<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.780> general<00:04:21.109> can<00:04:21.769> be<00:04:21.949> used<00:04:22.130> outside

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
talking in general can be used outside

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.820 
talking in general can be used outside
they<00:04:23.360> tend<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.570> be<00:04:23.720> more<00:04:23.900> ultraviolet<00:04:24.560> light

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
they tend to be more ultraviolet light

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.719 
they tend to be more ultraviolet light
sensitive<00:04:25.389> acrylics<00:04:26.389> are<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:28.520> better

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
sensitive acrylics are the better

products<00:04:29.240> on<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.509> market<00:04:29.900> can<00:04:30.229> be<00:04:30.380> used

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
products on the market can be used

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.800 
products on the market can be used
outside<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:31.490> there's<00:04:31.729> an<00:04:31.880> advantage<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.599> to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
outside so there's an advantage just to

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.290 
outside so there's an advantage just to
acrylic<00:04:33.080> it's<00:04:33.380> easy<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.740> maintain<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.180> do

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
acrylic it's easy to maintain but you do

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.180 
acrylic it's easy to maintain but you do
have<00:04:35.449> to<00:04:35.570> do<00:04:35.690> maintenance<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.289> it<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.590> if<00:04:37.039> your

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
have to do maintenance on it and if your

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.010 
have to do maintenance on it and if your

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
customers aren't willing to do that then

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.659 
customers aren't willing to do that then
perhaps<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.919> need<00:04:40.009> to<00:04:40.070> be<00:04:40.250> looking<00:04:40.370> at

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
perhaps you need to be looking at

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.760 
perhaps you need to be looking at
something<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.449> doesn't<00:04:42.289> wear<00:04:42.410> off<00:04:42.440> so

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
something that that doesn't wear off so

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.120 
something that that doesn't wear off so
easily<00:04:43.539> epoxies<00:04:44.539> will<00:04:45.320> provide<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.830> stain

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
protection maybe not as much as epoxy

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.320

are not applied properly they can peel

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.810 
are not applied properly they can peel
off<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.639> they<00:05:25.760> do<00:05:25.820> have<00:05:25.909> it<00:05:26.180> heating<00:05:27.080> issues

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
off so they do have it heating issues

that you have to you have to be careful
about<00:05:30.760> your<00:05:31.760> things<00:05:32.060> typically<00:05:32.539> are<00:05:32.870> your

about your things typically are your
wear<00:05:34.520> layer<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.360> they're<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.750> durable<00:05:36.289> finish

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
wear layer so they're the durable finish

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
those as a maintenance layer so that

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.969 
those as a maintenance layer so that

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
gloss or low gloss and typically the

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.830 
gloss or low gloss and typically the
gloss<00:06:07.280> for<00:06:07.610> acrylics<00:06:08.030> comes<00:06:08.300> from<00:06:08.510> just<00:06:08.660> not

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
gloss for acrylics comes from just not

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.290 
gloss for acrylics comes from just not
applying<00:06:09.170> enough<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:10.040> more<00:06:10.250> coats<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:11.000> apply

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
applying enough the more coats you apply

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.800 
applying enough the more coats you apply
the<00:06:11.360> shinier<00:06:11.960> it<00:06:12.050> gets<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:14.480> more<00:06:14.510> coats

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
the shinier it gets and the more coats

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.970 
the shinier it gets and the more coats
you<00:06:14.930> apply<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.170> better<00:06:15.410> protection<00:06:15.650> you're

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
you apply the better protection you're

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.380 
you apply the better protection you're
getting<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:16.460> it's<00:06:16.670> kind<00:06:17.000> of<00:06:17.090> a<00:06:17.150> trade-off

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
getting so it's kind of a trade-off

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.660 
getting so it's kind of a trade-off
between<00:06:17.570> protection<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.620> Sheen<00:06:19.070> with

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
between protection and Sheen with

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.850 
between protection and Sheen with
urethanes<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.810> sheen<00:06:21.080> is<00:06:21.260> built<00:06:21.500> into<00:06:21.710> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
urethanes the sheen is built into the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.640 
urethanes the sheen is built into the
finish<00:06:22.190> so<00:06:22.820> if<00:06:22.940> you<00:06:23.060> want<00:06:23.240> a<00:06:23.300> low<00:06:23.540> Sheen<00:06:23.870> not

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
finish so if you want a low Sheen not

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.190 
finish so if you want a low Sheen not
dead<00:06:25.430> matte<00:06:25.700> but<00:06:25.970> very<00:06:26.270> low<00:06:26.480> Sheen<00:06:26.780> finish

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
dead matte but very low Sheen finish

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.750 
dead matte but very low Sheen finish
that<00:06:27.380> stands<00:06:27.800> up<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.130> just<00:06:28.310> about<00:06:28.490> anything

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
that stands up to just about anything

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.030 
that stands up to just about anything
throw<00:06:29.300> at<00:06:29.420> it<00:06:29.450> then<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.260> urethane<00:06:30.590> would<00:06:30.890> be<00:06:31.010> a

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
throw at it then a urethane would be a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.690 
throw at it then a urethane would be a
good<00:06:31.220> choice<00:06:31.490> there<00:06:31.910> are<00:06:32.120> blends<00:06:32.720> certainly

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
good choice there are blends certainly

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.220 
good choice there are blends certainly
commonly<00:06:34.700> there<00:06:35.120> are<00:06:35.330> urethane<00:06:35.810> acrylic

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
commonly there are urethane acrylic

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.680 
commonly there are urethane acrylic
blends<00:06:36.500> on<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.830> market<00:06:37.220> your<00:06:37.580> things<00:06:37.910> don't

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
blends on the market your things don't

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.330 
blends on the market your things don't
like<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.020> stick<00:06:39.290> to<00:06:39.470> concrete<00:06:39.890> very<00:06:40.070> well

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
like to stick to concrete very well

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.810 
like to stick to concrete very well
acrylics<00:06:41.240> do<00:06:41.450> so<00:06:42.230> a<00:06:42.260> blend<00:06:42.770> of<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.130> two<00:06:43.160> when

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
acrylics do so a blend of the two when

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.510 
acrylics do so a blend of the two when
it's<00:06:43.970> formulated<00:06:44.570> that<00:06:44.690> way<00:06:44.900> can<00:06:45.620> kind<00:06:46.340> of<00:06:46.400> get

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
it's formulated that way can kind of get

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.590 
it's formulated that way can kind of get
the<00:06:46.640> best<00:06:46.790> of<00:06:46.970> both<00:06:47.150> worlds

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
the best of both worlds

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.760 
the best of both worlds
so<00:06:47.720> there<00:06:47.870> could<00:06:48.080> there<00:06:48.110> are<00:06:48.320> some<00:06:48.530> single

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
so there could there are some single

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.740 
so there could there are some single
component<00:06:49.370> finishes<00:06:49.730> on<00:06:49.850> the<00:06:49.940> market<00:06:50.300> that

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
component finishes on the market that

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.780 
component finishes on the market that
are<00:06:50.870> urethane<00:06:51.350> acrylic<00:06:51.710> blends<00:06:51.980> that<00:06:52.520> bond

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
are urethane acrylic blends that bond

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.450 
are urethane acrylic blends that bond
well<00:06:53.090> to<00:06:53.990> properly<00:06:54.350> prepared<00:06:54.800> concrete<00:06:55.250> and

well to properly prepared concrete and

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.420 
well to properly prepared concrete and
provide<00:06:56.240> decent<00:06:56.840> stain<00:06:57.470> protection<00:06:58.040> to

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
provide decent stain protection to

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.020 
provide decent stain protection to
compromise<00:06:58.910> it's<00:06:59.150> not<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.450> best<00:06:59.630> of<00:06:59.900> a

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
compromise it's not the best of a

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.110 
compromise it's not the best of a
multi-step<00:07:02.030> multi<00:07:02.720> coating<00:07:03.140> system<00:07:04.070> but<00:07:04.970> it's

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
multi-step multi coating system but it's

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.470 
multi-step multi coating system but it's
easier<00:07:05.480> so<00:07:06.380> again<00:07:06.710> you<00:07:06.919> have<00:07:07.130> to<00:07:07.430> weigh<00:07:07.730> what

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
easier so again you have to weigh what

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.270 
easier so again you have to weigh what
seat<00:07:08.720> what's<00:07:09.110> best<00:07:09.350> for<00:07:09.500> your<00:07:09.740> customer

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
seat what's best for your customer

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.370 
seat what's best for your customer
something<00:07:10.880> that's<00:07:11.210> easy<00:07:11.419> for<00:07:11.540> you<00:07:11.750> to<00:07:11.840> do<00:07:12.080> or

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
something that's easy for you to do or

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.900 
something that's easy for you to do or
something<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:12.860> gives<00:07:13.040> them<00:07:13.130> long-term

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
something that gives them long-term

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.310 
something that gives them long-term
performance<00:07:14.300> but<00:07:14.810> might<00:07:14.990> be<00:07:15.020> more

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
performance but might be more

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.290 
performance but might be more
challenging<00:07:15.919> for<00:07:15.950> you<00:07:16.250> that's<00:07:16.730> a<00:07:17.000> decision

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
challenging for you that's a decision

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.050 
challenging for you that's a decision
