 either we are Monday exclusive evening a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.640
 new video actually there I come back from 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.870
 three days in London with gwen here 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.010
 it was great and that's because in fact 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.150
 it was a year and a half that we were 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
 did not leave somewhere we were not 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
 out of everyday life and in fact I'm doing 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.040
 this video to tell you that I have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.420
 produced stuff done over there 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 often these people go on vacation 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.880
 even a few days or sometimes even 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.650
 a few weeks for his very long 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.029
 vacation is to get out of everyday life 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 to change ideas 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.500
 change their habits and that's it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.580
 a lot of well boosted three days 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 but it feels good too but I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 realized that I actually have some 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.059
 luck but to death 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.710
 the measure counts only bath I love this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.450
 that I actually do this daily has me 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 missed a few steps actually I got 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 said good morning I get up and I get 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.850
 were saying ah what am I not going 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.309
 do as video banon tells lucas 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 calm down I mean I do not know I 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.410
 realized that I have a huge chance 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.730
 to do what I do to live from that 2 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.170
 when I get up in the morning I'm 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.879
 happy to do what I do I'm 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 not for example I do not work at one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.270
 place that I do not like I do not get up 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.809
 bad losers have shit must 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 to go to work 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 I do my delusions with you and I 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 actually told me page 12 and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 damn but it's true that sometimes he 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 I miss these people it's funny because 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.240
 that finally we do not know each other 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 personally 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 good I see some find on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 twitter your photos your nicks this same 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.750
 name and surname panel and I say to myself 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.549
 fucking but these people that finally 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 I do not know much about you 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 know the most that I know you 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.350
 finally and Thursday but same time as 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 it misses to have a good time with 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 them I do not know to play a game with them 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.180
 because in fact when I make a video 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.920
 I do not feel like you're a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.150
 million to watch me play like that where 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 1500 miles or formulas I know 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.720
 nothing but the impression that you who 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.520
 watch this video you're with me on 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.829
 this seat all towards the for example it's 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.119
 just there and then that hello I 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.229
 together we have fun as we all 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 actually does in our life plays with 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.560
 our friends a game even if there are 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.509
 the joystick since it's a solo game 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.640
 we can this level can really be 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.020
 to laugh in front and well I miss it and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.970
 here I was fucking damn but actually 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 I manage my daily 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.329
 many people are fleeing their 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 everyday but I love my daily life 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.619
 and it's thanks to you and I actually 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 say that sometimes we do not thank you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.560
 its ends me personally from the case I 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 find that I do not thank you enough 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.649
 for this movement actually carried the video 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.090
 we did yesterday , we look at my senses 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.069
 and a video or that's pretty 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.390
 fun to see a young guy all 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.649
 points her buttocks make videos 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.640
 but in the end a lot I go there 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.050
 in fact actually 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.190
 just that it's funny afterwards 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.569
 a few years later when they see 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.440
 how ttc like the musicians 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.730
 should start doing the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.590
 music I do not think the guy does a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.260
 tube the first time and he makes 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.310
 rotten babe rotten stuff but hey he 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.110
 does what he can and finally 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.550
 they evolve they progress and we 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.660
 was a bit like that and I thought 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.280
 damn but what did we do 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.490
 way in my first videos when 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 I was in second at the time that I 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.760
 did not know what route to take to arrive 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.050
 in first or in terminal that I do 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.660
 to eat post I had told him but 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.060
 I had tried to do a btm a no 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.280
 yes a cameraman editor bts something like 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.260
 that and you said that the public had me 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.660
 recaled although severely yet that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.510
 I have my bac and bac s but I got 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.610
 said good ok very well it works eh ben I 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.930
 I'm going to make videos and I'm going to like it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.310
 listen to the people watching you 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.700
 around what to make videos on 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.930
 Internet 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.130
 but what is it not that the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 parents especially obviously the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.310
 young people make a stylus and as I said 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.840
 now all the morning when I'm getting 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.920
 up I tell myself not that I'm going 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.720
 work but I'm going to have fun 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.400
 bagis job service but hey it's 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 really fun and that I can 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
 live from that and next door I see pots 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.550
 everything even my brother or whatever they are 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.900
 in a in a more standard setting then 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.700
 I just wanted to thank you again 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 once for that that far away says of 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.760
 my daily made me take 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.500
 aware of how good I was 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.400
 in fact and that's it sometimes we go 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 not count of certain things 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.920
 I also became aware of one thing 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.110
 it is necessary to take at all costs 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.430
 pleasure in what we do is to 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 to say that if a lot of people want a 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 video on this or that thing but that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 we did not wait for it and fÃ¨re 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.120
 well do not do it and if the opposite 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.709
 really want to make a video but 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.420
 we know that it will not please any more than 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.040
 that to people in the end we think he did not 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.299
 could not do that to people it takes 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.880
 still do it and have fun 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.070
 first of all to keep the envy 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.799
 to make videos keep them want to 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.940
 create content on youtube here it is 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.799
 do not keep this urge and that's it 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 that I want you to understand is 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.410
 for that sometimes I do some 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.370
 things that people do not like about 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.510
 example and multi video I know 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.950
 that there are a lot of people who love 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.299
 completely and others who hate 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.260
 at the highest point but it's just that 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.160
 it's videos they change me to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.959
 sky I usually do 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.269
 and then that allow me to put my 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.829
 friends around me in this world in 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.410
 which I am all year almost 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.910
 everyday etc etc videos that me 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.079
 like a lot so I did when 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.420
 even though there are people who make 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.130
 it's boring I tell about soils etc and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.810
 jade not say and it's very annoying at 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.590
 peeling and then it's a chance not to 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.770
 not to forget it is 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.530
 fucking lucky to live from that I have not 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.540
 in France there may be 30 youtuber 42 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.880
 big max who live on that and I do 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.320
 part of those there and it's a trick of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.760
 crazy and it's thanks to you and that's me 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.169
 do not know in the train on the return of 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.699
 london realized all ages listen to 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.130
 music a little bit sad and 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.479
 sneaky and I said good saw you 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.100
 that you're lucky you really have 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.810
 luck is a crazy thing when 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.040
 you see people galley around late I 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.470
 repeat me but it's a chance 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.790
 incredible and I thought if you because 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.280
 this video that delirious with me on 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.350
 games or even on skits etc you have 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.360
 desires in the life of the stuff that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.410
 You want to do 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.600
 good must it be a little sensible 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.770
 still but frankly dark if 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.930
 you want to make videos for example 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.639
 on youtube do not wait any 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.040
 something of that you do not have to say I do 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.780
 videos in order to be known or 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.889
 I not know what I do not know what 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.060
 other and zou a little weird sometimes 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.979
 people find to make videos 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.479
 you just have to say it's a delusion 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.419
 that I like it I like to create these 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.830
 things here I do it we'll see how 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.030
 it's happening but go ahead do not be afraid 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.010
 because I currently have one 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.870
 little in a world where we laugh enough 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.550
 it's easier it's more cool 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.150
 say will have you seen that person there is 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.740
 ridiculous 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.600
 oc news that makes then we will laugh on 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.770
 his face that to say oh I love what 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.060
 this person spanking blow what she 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.130
 actually look is going to see just as I like 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.690
 well and I know that sometimes it creates 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.700
 kinds of barriers people they dare 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.630
 not take the step towards what they have 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.500
 towards what they want to do 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.940
 bottom of for example at gap 1 of 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.200
 pace of making videos that do not go 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.030
 not do them because they are caught 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.340
 2,3 criticism in the jorane face and 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.810
 ucopia such a man you do it like him 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.419
 chews a pretty nil sweater has never 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.950
 frankly last night I saw brilliantly that 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.690
 I did you saw what it was 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.370
 I'm not saying that when you're doing 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.150
 Videos you'll necessarily good market 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.280
 on youtube etc 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.599
 but if you take pleasure in it and 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.660
 it's a small passion that you have 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.950
 and many dark and does find your 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.960
 passion we all have basically maybe a 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.370
 passion a little me for example it was 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.380
 videos and video games but there is 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.310
 that's good times we're 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.960
 in the everyday life we are not there 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.280
 necessarily good to dive into 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.840
 something me it was the videos to 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.090
 the time is for those who are not 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.860
 necessarily very comfortable in their life and 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.110
 who at school is not necessarily good 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.810
 that are victims of mockery or 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.289
 what me personally I hate it 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.610
 here is to see someone who 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.860
 I take mockery at length of 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.389
 day all year I hate it good 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.860
 there I speak I move from a subject to a 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.439
 other like that without 36 years did a little 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.520
 weird but here it is I mean if 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.149
 you are not very very good at 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.129
 your daily life 

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:38.719
 try to find things to which 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.969
 you invest create things 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.199
 that's just all I have to 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.490
 to say because it saved me a little 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.930
 from the time when I was very very bad 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.979
 in my head mentally makes me 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.779
 to make videos that was a little what 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.740
 made me stand 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.550
 so here I hope you too 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.979
 find a little trick that will make you 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.180
 hold on finally good here I see here I 'm doing 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.800
 just this video to tell you for 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.789
 to say thank you again that's me 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.869
 weird thing to do this little video 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.949
 because it's true that eventually I 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.330
 can not talk to you directly as 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.610
 that for five ten minutes outside 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.860
 may not be interested at all 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.419
 9/10 of you but at least I would have 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.249
 put the video I wanted to put where I 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.360
 see where I tell you that I was holding 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.300
 really to tell you these things there 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.009
 and then and then thank you for everything 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.029
 am definitely moved right now 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.050
 it's squeeze him 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:16.339
 I hope it made you happy 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.719
 also that it will have given you courage 

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.279
 for those who are not extremely well 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.080
 of their daily lives and who for those who 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.999
 are well and ben I hope you 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.259
 will be even better here thanks to you 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.539
 watch this video the young people watch 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:29.180
 but my videos every day weeks 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.559
 to years ahead is super cool 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.269
 and then I hope that all that 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.199
 will continue for a long time thank you 

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.769

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.769
