00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.560
The shooting is the longest part
in the making of an animated film.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.120
And especially for the
Henri &amp; Edmond films,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.280
It is extremely long because
it is quite improvised,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.600
This isn't done in
a production agency,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.280
With a huge team
and many animators.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.040
But this is an interesting part,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.200
this is when all the concepts
in the screenplay

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.720
start to come to life.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.600
The characters start to move
onscreen.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.320
This is not like working
with huge stopmotion puppets,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.840
like what you see in the
Wallace &amp; Gromit films.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.720
Here the figures are
4cm high.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.480
And with small plastic figures,
you have unexpected problems :

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.560
dust, light reflects...

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.160
I'm using an animation software,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.720
that allows me to control
the animation, live.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.040
I can see what my last
10 frames look like,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.880
that means I can also see
what the current frame looks like.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.920
The sound is recorded
prior to the animation.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.480
This helps me sync the movement
with the dialogue line.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.200
We're in the middle
of the summer,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.000
hidden in the dark,
this isn't easy,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.440
but at the end of each day,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.120
I watch new segments
of the film completed.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.120
I see the evolution
of the film day by day,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.880
With a live actor film,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.600
You shoot everything
and then do the editing.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.520
Here, each day I can
watch 10 new seconds of film.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480
They might not be
properly edited,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.040
But the film progressed.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.040
In order to complete
15 or 20 minutes of film,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.240
there's still a LOT
of work ahead,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.600
but there's this reward
everyday,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.520
when they come to life
onscreen.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.520
This is pure happiness !
