I<00:00:41.660> liked<00:00:42.660> season<00:00:43.320> mine<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.460> bit<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I liked season mine with a little bit of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.050 
I liked season mine with a little bit of
lemon<00:00:45.660> zest<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.910> they

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
lemon zest and now what I do it they

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.330 
lemon zest and now what I do it they
actually<00:00:48.180> bus<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.290> meat<00:00:49.560> rather<00:00:49.980> than<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
actually bus up the meat rather than the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.210 
actually bus up the meat rather than the
pan<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.200> that<00:00:52.200> way<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.530> butter<00:00:52.770> stays

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
pan and that way the butter stays

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.040 
pan and that way the butter stays
actually<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.970> around<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.450> meat<00:00:54.630> and<00:00:54.810> hops

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
actually all around the meat and hops

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
actually all around the meat and hops
that<00:00:55.200> caramelize<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.460> produces<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> most

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that caramelize and it produces the most

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
that caramelize and it produces the most
beautiful<00:00:57.600> source<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> goes<00:00:59.220> into

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
beautiful source so it just goes into

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
beautiful source so it just goes into
