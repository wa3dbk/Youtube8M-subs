trying<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> pleasure<00:03:24.450> over<00:03:24.780> China<00:03:40.730> well<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
trying to pleasure over China well I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
trying to pleasure over China well I
think<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.269> only<00:03:42.420> way<00:03:42.630> we<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.080> around<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
think the only way we can go around this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.900 
think the only way we can go around this
is<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.799> if<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.100> obviously<00:03:44.400> not<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.730> game

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
is up if it's obviously not on the game

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.759 
is up if it's obviously not on the game
it's<00:03:45.120> something<00:03:45.239> he's<00:03:45.480> downloaded<00:03:46.049> online<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
it's something he's downloaded online so

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's something he's downloaded online so
I'm<00:03:47.070> thinking<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.940> maybe<00:03:48.060> some<00:03:48.390> better

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I'm thinking that maybe some better

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.449 
I'm thinking that maybe some better
security<00:03:49.019> protection<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.100> he<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.340> not

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
security protection so that he can not

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.880 
security protection so that he can not
access<00:03:50.640> any<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> these<00:03:51.239> sites<00:03:51.570> because<00:03:51.959> some
