00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.960 
pick up some black and I'm going to just
paint<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:04.430> pupil<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.520> if<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> bleeds

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
paint that pupil in and if the bleeds

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.970 
paint that pupil in and if the bleeds
that's<00:03:09.240> okay<00:03:09.630> because<00:03:09.870> eyes<00:03:10.320> have<00:03:10.710> these

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's okay because eyes have these

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.930 
that's okay because eyes have these
little<00:03:14.150> variations<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.550> final

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
little variations and then for the final

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750 
little variations and then for the final
step<00:03:18.300> I'm<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.560> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.740> pick<00:03:19.950> up<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.190> darker

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
step I'm just going to pick up a darker

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.250 
step I'm just going to pick up a darker
version<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> same<00:03:21.990> Prussian<00:03:22.590> blue<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
version of the same Prussian blue and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.210 
version of the same Prussian blue and
I'm<00:03:28.260> just<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:30.650> around<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.980> very

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
I'm just going to go around the very

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:43.559 
I'm just going to go around the very
edge

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.500 

and<00:03:44.140> finally<00:03:44.859> I'm<00:03:45.819> going<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.030> go<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> little<00:03:46.359> bit

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
and finally I'm going to go a little bit

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:57.760 
and finally I'm going to go a little bit
even<00:03:46.749> darker<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:50.219> right<00:03:51.219> with<00:03:51.430> that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.690 

eyelash<00:03:58.730> meets<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.900> top<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.770> I<00:04:00.800> there

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
eyelash meets the top of the I there

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460 
eyelash meets the top of the I there
would<00:04:01.820> be<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.970> shadow<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:02.960> just<00:04:03.140> go<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> little

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
would be a shadow so I just go a little

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.590 
would be a shadow so I just go a little
bit<00:04:03.680> darker<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:05.240> make<00:04:05.420> these

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
bit darker and then you just make these

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.810 
bit darker and then you just make these
little<00:04:05.750> lines<00:04:06.250> pick<00:04:07.250> up<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.460> little<00:04:07.640> bit<00:04:07.730> more

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
little lines pick up a little bit more

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.190 
little lines pick up a little bit more
paint<00:04:10.060> little<00:04:11.060> lines<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:14.780> create<00:04:14.990> the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
paint little lines that create the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.460 
paint little lines that create the
little<00:04:15.410> details<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.220> then<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:17.020> if<00:04:18.020> the<00:04:18.080> black

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
little details and then if if the black

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.430 
little details and then if if the black
runs<00:04:19.010> into<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.840> color<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.959> little<00:04:21.110> bit<00:04:21.320> more

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
runs into the color a little bit more

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.690 
runs into the color a little bit more
you<00:04:21.590> could<00:04:21.709> just<00:04:21.770> pick<00:04:22.010> up<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.220> little<00:04:22.430> bit<00:04:22.550> more

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
you could just pick up a little bit more

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.070 
you could just pick up a little bit more
the<00:04:22.850> opaque<00:04:23.210> white<00:04:23.420> that's<00:04:23.690> what's<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> nice

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
about it you can you can go over areas

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.500 
about it you can you can go over areas
if<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:28.100> bleeds<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.820> little<00:04:29.030> too<00:04:29.180> much<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:31.510> I'll
