anything else here we scored six goals
however<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.309> know<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.700> know<00:00:11.730> they're

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
however you know and I know they're

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
however you know and I know they're
descending<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> sending-off

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
descending off so but the sending-off

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
descending off so but the sending-off
was<00:00:15.660> Tony<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.560> made<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> free<00:00:17.070> Neil<00:00:17.279> so

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
was Tony all that made it free Neil so

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.099 
was Tony all that made it free Neil so
if<00:00:17.850> he<00:00:18.029> wasn't<00:00:18.359> saying<00:00:18.480> off<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:18.900> still

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
if he wasn't saying off it was still

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.359 
if he wasn't saying off it was still
been<00:00:19.350> frendall<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:23.869> think<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.279> some<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
been frendall and I think that some of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.769 
been frendall and I think that some of
the<00:00:26.430> football<00:00:26.640> would<00:00:26.970> play<00:00:27.150> late<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> game

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the football would play late in the game

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
the football would play late in the game
and<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and I know the one down but and that the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.190 
and I know the one down but and that the
the<00:00:30.810> sixth<00:00:31.380> goal<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.890> absolutely<00:00:32.520> fantastic

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
the sixth goal was absolutely fantastic

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.940

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
scored a fantastic edder but he's made

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.070

hell's his goal with a header back

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800 
hell's his goal with a header back
across<00:01:13.470> his<00:01:13.530> set<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.610> move<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
across his set up the move for the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.920 
across his set up the move for the
gutter<00:01:16.140> ridges<00:01:16.530> goal<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.250> goal<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.930> just

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
gutter ridges goal first goal I just

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
gutter ridges goal first goal I just
think<00:01:19.080> his<00:01:19.259> all-around<00:01:19.530> players<00:01:20.150> couldn't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
think his all-around players couldn't

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
think his all-around players couldn't
handle<00:01:21.420> him<00:01:21.570> before<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.140> outstanding<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
handle him before he was outstanding and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.399 
handle him before he was outstanding and
I<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.340> obviously

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
I have to say that you know obviously

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.080 
I have to say that you know obviously
not<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.560> Jonathan<00:01:29.100> Smith<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
not know Jonathan Smith and in the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.319 
not know Jonathan Smith and in the
second<00:01:30.479> half<00:01:30.600> no<00:01:30.840> petty<00:01:31.140> Radek<00:01:32.180> looked<00:01:33.180> at

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
second half no petty Radek looked at

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.560 
second half no petty Radek looked at
Robby<00:01:33.570> Robinson<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.890> lawless<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.000> house<00:01:36.270> has

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Robby Robinson and lawless and house has

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
Robby Robinson and lawless and house has
not<00:01:36.810> been<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> team<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.700> that's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
not been on the team and I think that's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
not been on the team and I think that's
just<00:01:39.540> shows<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.740> strength<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
just shows that the strength of the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.810 
just shows that the strength of the
squad<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> reasons<00:01:43.170> why<00:01:43.380> we

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
squad that we have in the reasons why we

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
squad that we have in the reasons why we
we<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.890> made<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.909> FA<00:01:48.600> Trophy<00:01:48.659> game<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
not playing you know the opportunity to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
not playing you know the opportunity to
actually<00:01:58.170> play<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.740> might<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.100> first<00:01:59.369> team

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
actually play what might be first team

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.540 
actually play what might be first team
games<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.149> opposed<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> development<00:02:01.140> going

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
games as opposed to development going

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.180 
games as opposed to development going
and<00:02:02.140> certainly<00:02:03.140> wasn't<00:02:03.350> disappointed<00:02:04.070> with

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190

and certainly wasn't disappointed with
that<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:04.940> think<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.480> they<00:02:06.290> were

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
that you know so I think that they were

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.190 
that you know so I think that they were
the<00:02:06.530> highlights<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:07.130> me
