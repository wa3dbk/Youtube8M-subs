00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.269
 finally an Italian tutorial for 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:20.699
 explain 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.340
 our phantom ii as you see is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 equipped with blade protectors 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.739
 because I always recommend it for i 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 beginners as myself in the 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.200
 my first few minutes of flying or destroyed a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.320
 pack of propellers so I recommend 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.450
 absolutely to affix at least for i 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.090
 the first time the protection we are about to make 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 flying a phantom dj phantom ii is 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.910
 equipped with simba h 33 t which is the last one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 version is of course with a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.379
 cameras can no longer find a nice one 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 lawn what is the first procedure is the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.170
 first thing to understand is what 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 we need to make a gps point 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.360
 the first thing to do is to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.360
 turn on the remote control 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.639
 the second operation clearly and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.060
 to impose the saint on the ground we light the 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.060
 phantom 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.500
 we have to wait for the reporting of 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.710
 lED 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.720
 if they are green and yellow, of course not 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.040
 we still got the gps point 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.830
 so if the application of the gps point 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.260
 should remain difficult 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.750
 I advise you to do countless times 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.399
 with the button it is not a problem if a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 day until you see that there is a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.400
 acquisition and then a light appears 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.800
 green 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.370
 we are still in yellow and we must 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.370
 wait 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.600
 we are with the green so now it would be 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.120
 appropriate that the GPS acquisition must 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.480
 be math what we do it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:39.050
 let's rotate slowly to make people understand 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 that at any angle comes the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:54.049
 clone we are ready for the position 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.250
 let's not forget a drone in the moment 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:02.480
 of the flight to always keep an eye on 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.790
 memo lights within myself 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.090
 because red always indicates to us 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.090
 front lighting with the levers set 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.670
 the drone is ready for departure 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.209
 the camera halyard of the room sort 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.640
 is 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.640
 and certainly the open field 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.080
 it recovers now 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.190
 but a little his 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.199
 no no this 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.430
 and then lower past past you 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.430
 put the remote control nearby 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.859
 signs 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.859
 I came 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.200
 here now he makes the point of 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.770
 acquisition he rears up because 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.930
 naturally he does not know if there are obstacles 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.520
 and then what does once off the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.430
 remote control he finds the point 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.940
 it will automatically contain it again 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:03.510
 five seconds when he is sure he has 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:10.380
 identified the point he drops 12345 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.380
 here it is attention to the jacopo easel 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.470
 now he will do 2 jumping 2 or 3 1 2 frey
